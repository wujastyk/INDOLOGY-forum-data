 Re: kaara.naat paapam
        Thanks for your help. There is no doubt at all as to what 
kaara.naat paapa/pu.nya mean. They intend indirect causation in the 
sense, for example, respectively, of not slaying yet eating meat with 
the result that the meat eater accumulates the paapa of slaying, and 
of worshipping the bodhi tree -- because it evokes veneration of the 
Buddha -- with the result that the worshipper obtains the pu.nya of 
Buddha worship. What I wanted to know was whether the expressions 
<<as such>> are found elsewhere, and it seems that they aren't. 
Samayadivaakara becomes intelligible only on the assumption that the 
terms were so well known that they called for no comment, though he 
(he? somebody else? he himself in an after thought?) does define them 
in the above sense at a <<later>> point, but <<not>> at their first 
mention.
