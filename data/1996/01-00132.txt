Hello everybody, Recently CNN has wrongly shown Jammu and Kashmir as part of
Pakistan in one of their news item. The details are given at the end.

I am aware that this list is for discussions on Jainism. But I am assuming
that most of the people are Indians here. I hope you don't mind. I
sincerely apologise to anybody who does not like my sending this message on
this list.

I am sorry but I had to do it.

 To everybody who feel they are true INDIANS.
