    As regards the Ekakshara Upanishad, the text of which can also be found
in "The Samanya Vedanta Upanishads with the commentary of Sri
Upanishad-Brahma-Yogin, ed. by Pandit A. Mahadeva Sastri, Adyar 1921, pp.
106-110, as well as in One Hundred & Eight Upanishads... ed. by Wasudev
Laxman Shastri Pansikar, Bombay 1925, pp. 426-7, there is a brief English
summary of its contents by N.S. Subramanian in his Encyclopaedia of the
Upanisads, Oriental University Press, London 1986, pp. 158-159, which can
however be hardly called a "serious" study.
