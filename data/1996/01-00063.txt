Thank you to those of you who have rsponded to my queries re. html and 
sanskrit.  I am using html to cross-reference a pool of 21 terms from 
early vedic all of which have reference to notions of the self.  html is 
enabling rapid access and comparison of verson and easily associative 
linkage according to phonetic derivations, or without error due to them. 

if anyone is currently working even roughly close to these lines, please 
contact me.  thank you all for your time.
