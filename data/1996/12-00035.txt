Hi,

Thanks for the responses.

Thanks for the above explanation. I too have difficulty in understanding how
to 'measure' the 'distance' between 'neighbours': I don't understand how to say
when subjects and variables are close enough. However, this is the heart of the
whole analysis.

May be Indologist might consider talking to mathematicians! :-)

This adds another item to the list of 'I don't understand'; which algorithms 
are more 'objective'? Has non-parametric statistics (eg maximum likelihood)
been used in this area?
