This edition of the Ramayana is available on the web - order through
amazon.com (this will probably take longer) or go to the Princeton
University Press website (A search on AltaVista brings this up -
the site itself is the univ. of chicago press site). They both have
the Goldman books listed. Apparently, only the first volume is 
available in paperback - the prices make my head reel. Either 
the authors/editor or Princeton Univ. press want everyone to pay 
through their nose. I'm curious to know how many people are actually 
going to get personal copies?
