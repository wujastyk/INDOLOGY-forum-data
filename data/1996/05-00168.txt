    Query: Buddhist/Jain refutation of Hinduism
   *********************************************
we see several polemical writings against Jains & Buddhists.
This is one component of priest-peasant alliance proposed by Burton Stein
which successfully drove out these heretic religions.
I want to learn how Buddhism/Jainism refuted Brahmanical Hinduism
in early stages and its evolution? What are the main arguments of
Sramanas for rejecting Vedas? I am intrigued to hear of Buddhist homas. 
I have heard these religions preferred prakrits to vedic sanskrit.
Any references will be appreciated.
Thanx,
