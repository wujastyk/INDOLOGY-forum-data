Hindi etc.

You get this percentage by including speakers in the Hindi belt -- the 
status of Hindi as a lingua franca should depend on its use in the 
*non-Hindi* belt. Judging by your figures that is only 8.07% (50 million 
speakers of Hindi outside the Hindi belt out of a population of 620 
million outside that belt). But I assume you've given figures only for 
native speakers of Hindi, so the ones for second language users may be 
higher.
Well, only if they want to limit their interaction mainly to the Hindi 
belt in India.
I'm not against learning Hindi -- I'm just against unrealistic attempts 
to impose it on Indians and futile, pseudo-nationalistic opposition to 
English.
