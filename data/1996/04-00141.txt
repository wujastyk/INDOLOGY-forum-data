e-text of ManusmRti
I too have just downloaded the ManusmRti and would like to express my 
gratitude for this great service.  I use the e-texts of the MBh, the 
RaamaayaNa, and the Arthazaastra intensively on a daily basis and am 
profoundly grateful to those who have made it possible.  I look forward 
to putting the e-text of Manu to good use as well.
