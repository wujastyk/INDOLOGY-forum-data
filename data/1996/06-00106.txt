Subject: chole ke piche
Message-ID: <161227025110.23782.12740391580161229481.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

a rather mundane question:
The contraversial Hindi film song chole ke piche contains a line that sounds
like *baalii umariyaa merii, baalii umariyaa, sunii sajariyaa merii, sunii
sajariyaa*
anyone have any idea what this might mean?
thanks for all suggestions
