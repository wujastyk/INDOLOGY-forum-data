Are you sure that there exists a printed version? I have older
material here and the only reference to Bhavadeva's commentary I have
met with was in Aufrecht's Catalogus Catalogorum, sub voce
Prau.dhamanoramA. Aufrecht listed only one manuscript to be found in
one catalogue. I have checked the reference, in 1877 the manuscript
was part of a private collection and this means: unaccessible then and
most probably now. It seems to be a rare work.
