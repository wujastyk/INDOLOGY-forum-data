Both are linked to tamas qualities. They are outside the 'graha varna'.
They are always at 180 degrees from each other, but that is obvious.
I don't know. They are not given any bala in the dR^shhTi calculations. 
The raahu mahaadashaa is 18 years long while the ketu one is 7 years long.
Some people think that their influence is akin to mangala and shani. I think
ketu is linked to shani and raahu to mangala but I'm not sure.
You should perhaps consult a jyotisha; they may have a list somewhere! :-)
I suspect, however, that many are taken up with the upcoming polls in India...
