Agehananda Bharati recounts somewhere that an Indian army officer  
once claimed that Argentina got its name because Arjuna, the  
Pandava, conquered South America!

Mokshamula Bhatta and Pala Devasena, those ubiquitous Germans, are  
usually "credited" with taking away Vedic knowledge from India. I  
don't think there are any written accounts though, if you discount  
things written by P. N. Oak and others of his ilk.
