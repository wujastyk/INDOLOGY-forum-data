forehead marks (humor)
In the Samasthi Upanshana of the Chandi Path, we 
worship the Divine Mother by putting sindur on her 
her forehead with this mantra:
	We believe that it means that Divine Love, which 
has no selfish interest, drives the Chariot of the 
Light of Wisdom, and that Love is applied upon the 
third eye, the Ajnya Chakra, so that all perception 
will be through the eyes of Wisdom and Love. 
	Only a Divine Mother can look upon Her creation 
through the eyes of Wisdom and Love, and every woman 
is an incarnation of the Divine Mother. 
Please take our love and blessings.
