Subject: Upgraded Mahaabhaarata again
Message-ID: <161227026393.23782.4437920682630462254.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear Colleagues,

I placed the upgraded Mahaabhaarata e-text (1_1) in my ftp
site on October 3.  Prof. Tokunaga and one of his students,
however, found that some corrections were missing in the
process of comparison.

So I have replaced the Mahaabhaarata e-text in my site again.
If you downloaded the text between October 3 and 11, we
advice you to do it again.
Sorry for inconvenience!

My ftp address is:
ccftp.kyoto-su.ac.jp
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
the directory is:
pub/doc/sanskrit/mahabharata
