Accented Characters
Hi,
characters separately, so any accent(s) can be used with any 
character. These, of course, are entirely non-standard, and should be 
used only by consenting adults in private, but they do have their 
uses, e.g. for transliterating Indian languages, indicating scansion 
in verse, etc. These too, together with a couple of useful utility 
programs which make typing accented characters very simple, can be 
used by everyone on this list, and their colleagues.
The very useful work you are doing is highly commendable. Would these Indian
script TrueType fonts be located at the site above? What scripts are you 
working on please? Many thanks for the information.
Bye,
Girish Beeharry
