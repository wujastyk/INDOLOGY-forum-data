Could it be that the TEXTUAL sources say the wife (or other female) 
should be on one side, left or right, but are not clear whether this 
means what in heraldry is called the "proper" right or left, i.e. the 
side as viewed from the image's own viewpoint, or the right or left as 
viewed by an observer, and that this point has been interpreted 
differently in different times, places, and groups?  To explain the 
concept of "proper" side again:  if a statue of Parvati is placed on 
Siva's "proper" right it is next to Siva's right arm, but as a viewer 
looks at it it will be to the left of Siva.
