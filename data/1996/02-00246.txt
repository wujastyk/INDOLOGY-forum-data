E. Journal of Vedic Studies 1,4 (Dec.95)
 Dear Michael,
How are you?  Long time since I contacted you.  I want to ask you if you
would give me permission to publish two of your articles the one on
                EARLY SANSKRITIZATION.
               ORIGINS AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE KURU STATE.
and the one on LOOKING FOR THE HEAVENLY CASKET
either in our Journal of the Indological Society of Southern Africa or in
our Departmental Journal called Nidaan. We have two journals and both come
out around Nov-Dec each year.   I am also publishing Enrica Garzili's
article on Kashmir Shaivism.  Could you confirm if you would give me
permission.  Thank you very much.
with kind regards,
Pratap
