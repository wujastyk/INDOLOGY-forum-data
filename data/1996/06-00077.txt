Locating for Early Computer Indologists
Several of us have been working with an e-text of the Rig Veda found at the
Oxford Text Archive, deposited via Rutgers (RLIN) which apparently was 
done in the 1970's (the records are unclear). the complilers were H.S.
Ananthanarayana and W.P. Lehmann.  These are the only names available in
the citation.  Whether done in the 70's or not (imagine, though, with
those low-memory early 5 1/4" disks, and a text that size!), does anyone
know of either individual or how they could be reached.  Their code is
quite impressively systematic and we were hoping to contact them to learn 
more about the procedure they used.
Any help would be greatly welcome 
Thank you in advance,
