Yes, obviously -- but that hardly makes sense even as a separate word, and
definitely not in the context (astrological predictions of ill-fate:
putravarga-manastaapa.m janadve.sa.m ca vi.dvaram). But the ayurvedic
connection (vi.dvala --> gopaka) may be just right; thank you!
Unfortunately, though, the only meanings of "gopaka" that I know of are
"cowherd" and "protector". Would you (or anyone) know what "gopaka" might
mean in a medical context?
Thanks,
