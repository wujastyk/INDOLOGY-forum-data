comment on books, please
I would be glad to hear others' opinions on:
Skilton's History of Buddhism
Hiriyanna's  Outlines of Ind. Philosophy
        (and) Essentials of ....
These three works seemed quite recommendable as the first introduction 
textbooks. By Hiriyanna I saw only the Essentials in what respect are the 
Outlines better or worse ?
Thanks.
