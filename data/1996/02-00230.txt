urdu wordprocessing system
'Kaatib' is a free-ware, simple Nastaliq-wordprocessor, with scalable 
fonts. It is, however, not suitable for your ends (no footnotes, no indexing
etc., and no Roman).
There is a also commercial packet, Global Publisher, for DOS. 
I have only seen a brochure. It seems to have quite a lot of features 
(scalable fonts, Nastaliq *and* Roman, Keshidah for extended characters).
It is, however, rather expensive: cheapest version is L 595,00, versions
with more fonts L 795,00 and L 1595,00.

Then there is prof. Klaus Lagally's ARABTEX; beautiful Naskh, and
with all TeX's typesetting capabilities. As far as 
I know, Lagally is working on the implementation of Nastaliq fonts.
At this moment Urdu/Nastaliq commands will produce Naskh.
