forehead marks (humor)
Someone sometime wrote and responded:
When I was a boy in Norfolk Virginia we all knew the story of William Tell
and used to play at reenacting his famous feat, sometimes seriously and
sometimes humorously, miming unfortunate ends for Tell Jr.  Was this
disrespectful to boys, or to men, crossbowpersons, or Swiss?
