As far as I know, HolikA was the sister of Hira.nyakashipu. 

There is also the event called HolikA dahana on the night preceding the Holi 
where a straw puppet, representing HolikA, is burnt. Apparently HolikA had got
a vardAna from Brahma that she would be unscathed by fire. She was helping his
brother get rid of the too pious son by taking him on his lap and sitting on a 
pyre. Unfortunately for her, she was burnt to death with Brahma telling her 
that she was not supposed to use this boon to harm bhaktas. 

Hira.nyakashipu had also obtained a vardAna from Brahma but, that would be 
stretching the patience of the paNDitas a bit far... :-)

I'm an ignorant mUrkha but tried to help anyway! :-)
