"old indologists"
Thanks to Oliver and Gabriele and Valerie for your replies to my query. 
About the Baron von Stael-Holstein I found an entry in A DICTIONARY OF 
INDOLOGY, by A.K. Roy and N.N. Gidwani (Oxford and IBH Publishing Co., 
New Delhi 1985 onwards, 5 vols.) It seems this work includes entries for 
the well known indologists of the past. It is worthwhile to look at it.
