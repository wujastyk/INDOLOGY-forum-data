Violating the Red Fort:  Ritual Boundaries of Sovereignty in late Mughal 
and Early British India 

by Gail Minault

	Abstract 
	The Mughal empire rested upon a base of military power, sustained 
by the loyalty of men of talent to the central figure of authority, the 
emperor.  The emperor's authority was sustained by an elaborate structure 
of symbols and rituals.  These rituals took various forms, all of them 
designed to confirm the personal ties of loyalty between the emperor and 
his officers at the apex of the Mughal administrative hierarchy.  
Symbolizing the grant of patronage and protection on the one hand, and 
clientage and service on the other, these rituals also linked imperial 
authority to divine authority.
	After an introductory section in which the Mughal structure of 
symbols and rituals is explained, including such rituals as the jharoka, 
and the practice of exchanging nazars (gifts) for khilats (robes of 
honor), the paper then discusses the ways in which these rituals were 
participated in, and gradually changed, during the early years of British 
rule.  At first, early British officers willingly offered nazars as 
symbolic of loyalty and received in return robes of honor, titles, and 
offices.  Later, however, the British forbade their officers from 
accepting Mughal titles, and finally they discontinued the practices of 
offering nazars and receiving khilats.  Bishop Heber's description of his 
audience with Akbar Shah in 1824 is quoted, as are a number of policy 
pronouncements gradually repudiating ritual interactions.  The violation 
of the Red Fort referred to in the title was the disrespectful behavior 
of the Resident, Hawkins, in 1829, who rode into the Diwan-i-khas, 
penetrating the private area of the palace set off by the lal purdah (red 
curtain).  He was reprimanded for his actions, but they were symptomatic 
of an overall withdrawal of support by the British to Mughal authority in 
this period.
 


Thanks.
