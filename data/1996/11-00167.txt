Subject: Indigo Trade in India
Message-ID: <161227026943.23782.2001324891110169316.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Need some help with the history of Indigo cultivation and trade in India
(especially Bengal). What is the time period of its flourish and fall? I
know it was beginning to dwindle by the 1860s, after the Indigo Rebellion,
but when exactly did artificial indigo replace the natural version? I'll be
very grateful if anyone can supply any facts/figures on this or lead me to
other sources. I am trying to connect this to the Indigo Rebellion in 19th
century Bengal, particularly the Bengali play _Neeldarpan_ (1959) by
Dinabandhu Mitra.

Thanks.
