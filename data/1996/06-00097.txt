overemphasis on magic
In response to Peter Fluegel's recent observations:
While I agree in general...
[in fact I think that the point has already been made:
...I am not quite sure that we can avoid using the term 'magic.'  In the
case of a speech act like the Indic satyakriyA, the only way that I have
been able to distinguish this from other closely related speech acts, as I
have said, is to resort to Searle's category "supernatural declaration."  I
have preferred to adopt the term "magical performative" because it seems
more accurate, but I am willing to yield to a better description of the
satyakriyA and to a more precise characterization of its distinctive
features.  It is clearly different from the other speech acts with which it
has been compared.
