      South India and South East Asia
     *********************************

There are hundreds of articles and quite a few books on the ancient
relations between South India and South East Asia.
In addition to Southeast Asian scripts, I believe Kannada and 
Telugu scripts developed out of Pallava grantha script. 
A Burmese person or a Cambodian can recognize most of 
Telugu or Kannada characters.

Sculptures of Karaikkal Ammaiyar, a Tamil Saiva Saint,
are found in Khmer temples. Manimekalalai (6th century?) is 
a Buddhist epic in Tamil. Munimekala dance is still alive in Cambodia.
Tiruppavai and Tiruvempavai songs from 9th century are
sung during the coronation of Thai kings. South Indian folk
Ramayana versions are found in Indonesia and mainland nations.
