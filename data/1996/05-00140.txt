Isn't it possible to say precisely the same thing about Sanskrit language
because I believe it is also heavily coloured by Indian vernaculars.  For
instance, we know Caland (identified in his notes on Ananda Samhita the
influence of South Indian Syntax on Sanskrit) , Emenau and George Hart have
made substantial comments in this regard.  Although this is not my special
area of study, from my reading of Sanskrit texts composed in the South I
can tell how clsoe the syntax is to my mother tongue Telugu.  I am not
convinced that Telugu syntax is influenced by Sanskrit but I have a strong
feeling that Sanskrit syntax is influenced by many South Indian languages.
