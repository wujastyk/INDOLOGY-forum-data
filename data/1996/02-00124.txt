Sarasvati-Sindhu Civilization, c. 2500 B.C.
Dear Dr. Kalyanaraman,
Further to our discussion about your recent  l o n g  binhexed posting
to INDOLOGY, I should like to thank you for your understanding attitude
towards keeping INDOLOGY's bandwidth down in future.
INDOLOGY members please note:
It is a good idea to try to keep INDOLOGY messages to a maximum of about
two screenfuls, since many net users, especially in third-world
countries, pay for their email on a per-kilobyte basis.  Economy of
expression, apart from being an important self-discipline, makes for
better reading.
I have made your essay available as a document on the INDOLOGY web page
        http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgadkw/indology.html
under the menu option for "members' queries and information".  I shall
leave it there for a while, for anyone to consult, until disk space
becomes tight.
Sincerely,
Dominik Wujastyk,
