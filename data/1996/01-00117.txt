Field trip to India: HELP!
If you use simple color print film, something I've found quite adequate
for manuscripts, one money saving tip, particularly for slighly bigger
prints, is to get it developed and printed in India.  One big advantage of
color over black and white is that it enables you to identify text and
section divisions (usually in red) quite rapidly. A tripod is a must, and 
if possible you should use natural light, not flash. Also, be sure to 
photograph as close as possible, one (not double) page at a time if the 
manuscript is big or the writing small.
