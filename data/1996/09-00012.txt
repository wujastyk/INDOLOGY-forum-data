Sarasvati River Project: Research Scheme
The Indus Sarasvati Research Centre has been asked by the Ministry of Water
Resources to submit a project proposal for preliminary studies related to
the revival of the sacred Sarasvati river.
Attached is a preliminary draft response which we propose to submit. Dr.
Sivarajasingham, ex-FAO expert in hydrology, geology has provided great
assistance in drafting this; this is the first draft subject to further
revisions. 
The basic theme of the proposal is not to recreate the Sarasvati lakes; but
to hold the waters of the (would-be perennial) river underground and to
foster a comprehensive, and integrated development plan for the
north-western region served by the river. 
We would deem it a privilege to receive your comments and suggestions so
that we can incorporate them in the proposal. The proposal should include
components related to archaeology and culural-linguistic studies; any
suggestions in this regard are welcome.
Looking forward to your early response.
Best regards. Kalyanaraman.
