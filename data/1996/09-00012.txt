Subject: Sarasvati River Project: Research Scheme
Message-ID: <161227025890.23782.18268883179716224979.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

The Indus Sarasvati Research Centre has been asked by the Ministry of Water
Resources to submit a project proposal for preliminary studies related to
the revival of the sacred Sarasvati river.

Attached is a preliminary draft response which we propose to submit. Dr.
Sivarajasingham, ex-FAO expert in hydrology, geology has provided great
assistance in drafting this; this is the first draft subject to further
revisions. 

The basic theme of the proposal is not to recreate the Sarasvati lakes; but
to hold the waters of the (would-be perennial) river underground and to
foster a comprehensive, and integrated development plan for the
north-western region served by the river. 

We would deem it a privilege to receive your comments and suggestions so
that we can incorporate them in the proposal. The proposal should include
components related to archaeology and culural-linguistic studies; any
suggestions in this regard are welcome.

Looking forward to your early response.

Best regards. Kalyanaraman.
