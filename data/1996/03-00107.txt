Yvette,
I believe that the idea of a Munda/Mon-Khmer relationship, and a more 
distant link with Malayo-Polynesian, is generally accepted; proposed 
connections with Vietnamese and Thai are more controversial, but they are 
serious and not crank proposals. If no one gets to it sooner I'll try to 
look up some references.
However the Australian aboriginal languages, which you asked about 
originally, are a different story entirely, no one I can think of 
believes that they are traceably related to anything. 
(I was tempted to reply to your original post with a reference to Prof. 
Jan _Gonda_, but I see that others on the list are better at that sort of 
humor than I.)
