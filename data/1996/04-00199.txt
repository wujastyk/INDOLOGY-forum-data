Query: materials for refutation of 'sabdanityatva
I have discussed this and surveyed some literature on this (taking cues 
from Chemparathy's work on Udayana) in my book on Sabdapraman nd more in 
three or four papers which you will find listed in Philosophers' Index. 
One related paper came out recently in the Nagoya Studies in Indian 
Philosophy and Buddhism. (Which canvasses Nyaya-like Western critiques.)
Hope it helps. Let me have your references too.
