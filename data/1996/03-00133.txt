Temples and shoes
	After reading the long inscription "discovered" by Aklujkar, it
seems to me that the "scribe" has made some lapses in inscribing hrasvas
and diirghas.  I suggest that if Aklujkar were to visit the temple walls
at night again, he may find the corrected version of that great
inscription and report it to us.
	As for missing footware in temples, I have lost mine several 
times in temples in Pune.  It is one of the ways God makes the haves feel 
humble and vulnerable, and He rewards the non-haves.  Of course, as soon 
as I discovered that my footware was missing, I could always walk away 
with someone elses, with or without inscriptional support.
