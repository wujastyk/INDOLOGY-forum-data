Hi, 
This is quite unconvincing. It is only your opinion; based on your 'deep 
sensitivity and empathy' for your subject. :-)
Well, if you are closed to new ideas, which are not based on 'authority', then 
its pointless arguing about anything. As a physicist (former) you might 
remember that each time a new idea has been put forward in Physics, it has been
said to be 'crazy'! For instance Bohr asked Feynman whether he understood 
quantum mechanics when the latter was explaing his new approach for the first
time... :-)
The mere fact of your using email/computers etc is a way of attesting to the 
'rigorous' thinking of physicists. It is all based on very serious thinking in
Quantum Mechanics.
Yes, but has it got anything to do with reality? How do you know that they are
right? Is it because they write well? Or they are 'distinguished' orientalists
from a 'prestigious' university? What 'experiments' can you do to convince a
reader that you actually know what you are writing about? 
Indology is not like Mathematics, where internal consistency is of primary
importance, but more like Physics. After all, both Indologists and physicists
are trying to 'grasp' reality (in the etymological sense), no?
I am apologetic for the low Indological content of my message! 
Bye,
Girish Beeharry
