Dhik taan!
Dear prof. Aklujkar,
Fascinated by the beautiful play upon the words "dhik taan" in the line 
mentioned by Madhav Deshpande, I requested him to pass on the references of 
that verse to me if someone would come reactions. Now you have come up with the 
complete verse, I may also direct that request directly to you.
There is one more request: do you [or anyone else on the list] know more such 
passages containing puns on drum syllables?
best wishes,
