I'm curious what the date is on the Kennedy reference.  This is partly
because calibration of radiocarbon dates in 1980s publications re South
Asian archaeology could be wildly inconsistent (one of the best
archaeologists in India at that time, Makkhan Lal, once spent an entire
paper mercilessly showing up opponents in a controversy by demonstrating
inconsistencies in their use of radiocarbon).  While Kennedy is unlikely to
be remotely as foolish as Lal's hapless opponents, there's a specific
problem with 800 BC in particular, which is that very close to that date,
the amount of C14 in the atmosphere started dropping.  Ordinary radiocarbon
dates for the period 800 - 400 BC, or slightly better ones for the periods
800 - 550 or 550 - 400, have highly unpredictable uncalibrated values.  I'd
need to know how the dates in Kennedy's paper were being calibrated to know
whether this effect (only demonstrated during the 1980s) was being properly
offset.

This is a very long way of saying that I agree wholeheartedly with your
fundamental point in this post, but in doing so, may well upset your
specific example.  "After" and "before" 800 BC can mean very similar things
depending on which calibration curve is being used!

One of my biggest uncertainties about the results of Lukacs et al in the
Harappa site report is precisely that I don't know what curve *they* were
using, though I'm inclined to assume it was a current one.

I'm going to have to come back to this matter of Usenet, because I'm
becoming convinced it's *precisely* the best place for debate on this
issue.  But I feel compelled to note, however ironically, that I've got
record of your participating fairly extensively (and intelligently) in just
that debate.  I'm glad you changed your mind.
