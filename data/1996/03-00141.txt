ANNUAL WORKSHOP
"NON-HINDU TRADITIONS OF SOUTH INDIA"
SNOW MOUNTAIN RANCH, GRANBY, COLORADO
Thursday evening, June 6 through Sunday noon, June 9, 1996

	This year's Workshop will focus on non-Hindu traditions of South 
India, their texts, conceptual systems, values, practices, architectures, 
social organizations, relations with other traditions, and media.  
Proposals for papers on any of the following topics:

*Aspects of Jain, Muslim, Christian, Buddhist, Dalit, and new religious 
movements in South India.

*Attitudes, dialogues, and polemics between Hindu and non-Hindu 
traditions, historically or in the contemporary situation.

*Religious dimensions of organizations and communities with secular or 
ethnic ideologies.

*Comparative studies of non-Hindu traditions in South India with other 
regions of South Asia.

*Religious practices in which the boundary of Hindu and non-Hindu are 
blurred.

*History and critique of the category "Hindu" as it applies to the South 
Indian cultural area.

	The Conference on Religion in South India seeks to provide a 
forum for new and exploratory scholarship in a more small-scale and 
leisurely context than is possible at large scholarly conferences.  
Participants make forty minute presentations followed by thirty minutes 
of discussion.  Ample time is provided during the Workshop for individual 
and small group conversations.  Many colleagues attend without making 
presentations in order to enjoy the scholarly community in a relaxed 
atmosphere.

to Paul Courtright, CRSI, Department of Religion, Emory University, 
Atlanta, GA 30322.  Fax: 404-727-7597; Email:relpbc at emory.edu.
