There are only two editions:
(1) The June edition is standard PostScript and readily printable, but 
older versions of GhostScript/GhostView have difficulty displaying 
properly it on-screen; and 
(2) the July edition (same contents) is readily viewable on-screen
with the older versions of Ghostscript/GhostView but seems unprintable
on standard PostScript printers.

There are also two versions: for letter paper (US) and A4 paper (Europe).

As to sites: so far as I have been informed, details are appended below.

Regards,
Charles Wikner.
