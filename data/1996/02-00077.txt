Thank you very much for your kind help.
It seems everybody knew the answer but us!
Sorry for asking such an unindological question. The thing is, we *are* 
indologists, but only Ditte is still working in the field (more or less, 
at least: on rock inscriptions in the Upper Indus Valley, at the Heidelberg 
Academy of Sciences)
We?ve turned into one-and-a-half literary translator(s) and are currently doing 
Seamus Heaney?s Oxford Lectures ("The Redress of Poetry") into German.
So thanks again; and
shabdaarthaav iva samprktau shabdaarthapratipattaye /
jagatah pitarau vande paarvatiiparameshvarau //
(as a translator should)
Drs. Ditte Koenig & Giovanni Bandini
