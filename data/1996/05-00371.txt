Q: Etymology of yameLutekulA
Dear sirs,
We have vary curious names in the cullavagga of Vinaya:
yameLutekulA who spoke to the Buddha
"handa mayaM bhante buddhavacanaM chandaso AropemA."
The names are disolved into yameLu and tekula and
another possibility is given in a footnote,
yameLa and utekula (SBOE vol.20, p.149).
The Thai version (Mahidol CD) gives meTThakokuTThA.
In any case my guess does not work!
Any suggestion?
Yours,
Yoo Shinyoung
