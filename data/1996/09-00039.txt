        The magical power rather is borne by the syllables themselves, not only 
        by the letters that represent them. 
Considering the all important mono-syllable "Om",  I find 
that the Tamil writing of this syllable has a much more 
"magical", numinous, and visually arresting quality than 
its Devanagari counterpart.
