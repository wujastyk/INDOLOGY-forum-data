Sanskrit-Chinese
I am forwarding this from another list:
 Sanskrit Chinese
I am not sure if this question has been asked before, but I would like
to know if there is any dictionary or glossary in one form or another
which contains Sanskrit with Chinese (Classical Chinese preferably)
and viceversa, Classical Chinese Sanskrit.  If someone in this forum
knows of a resource like this, please let me know.
