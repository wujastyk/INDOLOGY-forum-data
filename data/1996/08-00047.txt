Dear David Magier,
Please announce the publication of the following new book..
--------------------

The Teaching and Acquisition of South Asian Languages
Edited by Vijay Gambhir, 1995
University of Pennsylvania Press, Philadelphia
Ph: 1-800-445-9880

Cloth, ISBN 0-8122-3328-x, $29.95


The first book to apply the latest methodological analysis to the languages
of South Asia. The Teaching and Acquisition of South Asian Languages
provides a much needed examination of learners and their learning patterns,
language materials and their delivery, classroom environments, and learning
conditions beyond the classroom. The contributors, accredited researchers
and experienced teachers, test important universal learning hypotheses on
"less commonly taught languages" and find that those circumstances have
significant implications for theory and practice. The book brings out into
focus a variety of issues related to lingusitic theory, second language
acquisition research, non-verbal communication, discourse appropriateness,
learner variation, and strategies for developing speaking, listening, and
reading skills. It is also a valuable addition to the general body of
knowledge in the field of adult language acquisition. A carefully prepared
index and an extensive bibliography covering both the South Asian field and
general literature enhance the book's usefulness as a reference guide.
