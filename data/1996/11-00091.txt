no chair of Sanskrit in London
What can happen to old Sanskritists:
Professor Hueckstedt suggestion of a "cash" language along with Sanskrit is excellent advice. I 
wish I had of received that suggestion years ago while I specialized in Sanskrit and Indian 
Studies at the University of Toronto. But as it happened my "cash" support turned out to be the 
Hindu priesthood. I now work as a Hindu priest in Southern California- something I could 
never have envisioned twenty years ago. I get to teach Sanskrit to my hearts content and I 
have no shortage of Students. Believe it or not I have over 40 students who range in years 
from 8 to 50. Sanskrit is still alive and well.
