Baring the right shoulder
If memory serves me right, Nanditha Krishna's book: The Art and Iconography
of Vishnu Narayana, explores some of the connections between South India and
the ancient near east. Undoubtedly, there is a corpus of research literature
on this subject.  We shouldn't be too surprised if there are similarities
between the Indus Valley civilization and practices in South India today.
