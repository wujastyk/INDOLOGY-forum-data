Baring the right shoulder
Yes, but the shoulder is not the reason one circumambulates 
clockwise.  Rather, it is just to keep the holy shrine or deity
to the right of one's self at all times, as a sign of respect.
As is well known, the poor left hand is kept out of the way due
to its use for certain cleansing tasks.
