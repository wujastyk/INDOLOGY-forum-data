__________________________________________

THE VEDAS, which include the Samhita, Brahmana, Aranyaka, and Upanisad
sections of the Rig, Sama, Atharva, and Yajur collections have functioned
both as revelation and as manuals of ritual for the many Hindu traditions. 
Notions of the unchanging, immutable, eternal sound of the Vedas have
coexisted with a pattern of dynamic interpretation whereby the perceived
meaning of the Veda has been made accessible and fitting to the changing
times and places.  While some sections of the Vedic texts and injunctions
have been recited and acted upon without major changes for at least the
last two thousand years, the process of understanding and decoding the
Vedas has not been static. While the Vedas themselves assert the force of
a "unifying" truth underlying the hymns and the philosophical speculation,
this truth has been interpreted in a manner that was fitting and
applicable to any given generation. The process of interpretation and
making the message relevant to any generation has been at the heart of
Vedic hermeneutics. 

Despite the composition of several works which have been more popular
among the masses than the Vedic revelation, the theoretical, ritual, and
epistemological significance of the Vedas has been unquestioned. Thus,
the highest honor given to a religious text which was important to any
religious tradition was to call that work the "fifth Veda."  In the last
two thousand years several such texts have claimed this title. 

The fifth Veda comprehends questions of legitimacy, legacy and spiritual
authenticity.  Many injunctive (ritual), mythological (Itihasa-Purana),
scientific, devotional and even biographical texts proclaim themselves to
be the fifth Veda, breaking through the traditional distinction between
sruti and smrti.  The key to breaking through the categories of sruti and
smrti is the public recognition of the authenticity and authority of
certain texts. For example, Bharata Muni, author of the Natya Sastra, the
primary text on the theory and practice of drama, relies on the
unprecedented nature of his enterprise to bring it into the orbit of
"Veda."  But Natya Sastra does not take this identification lightly or
simply analogically, but pleads its case by illustrating that the Vedas
themselves fall under the purview of natya. 

The Puranas employ several arguments in order to prove their identity as
Veda. One is that they are infallible because the supreme Lord is the very
embodiment of the Veda.  The Mahabharata, one of the two major Hindu
epics, was consistently called the "fifth Veda" because it was a
storehouse of religious and secular knowledge, both theoretical and
pragmatic. Vernacular compositions in the south, especially the
Tiruvaymoli ("Sacred Utterances") of Nammalvar in the ninth century and
the Periya Puranam, a hagiography of saints who were devotees of Siva,
were also considered to be equivalent to the Vedas. 

In the Kashmir Saiva tradition several agamic texts functioned as the
Veda.  These texts did not make even a cursory attempt to imitate or
reproduce the Sanskrit Vedas in any way, nor were they commentaries on the
Vedic texts.  They lay claim to the title "Veda" because the people who
venerated these works thought of them as containing the wisdom embodied in
the original Sanskrit Vedas. The concept of a fifth Veda expresses the
desire for any given community to negotiate the meaning of sruti and
mediate it to their milieu. 

It is not just within the Hindu tradition that the Veda of "Truth" is
important. Both Christians and Muslims in South India have appropriated
the notion of "Veda" and consider their scriptures to be revelation.  The
Veda is the vehicle to know the supreme, and in this sense both the Bible
and the Qur'an function as the "Veda." 

These are just some of the ways in which post-Vedic texts and traditions
appropriated the authority and authenticity of the Vedas. This is not to
say that the Vedic "tradition" suffered serious rupture, for this
extension is surely a natural result of a dynamic religious and literary
tradition that encouraged innovation while not losing sight of its
origins.

-- 9:00-11:30 AM

Discussion led by 
Dr. Francis X. Clooney, Boston College

Sunday's discussion will explore the implications of different usages of
the term "Veda" in various historical, literary, and religious contexts. 
How does the meaning of Veda translate into different traditions?  Does
Veda/scripture function differently in different traditions?  Has the Veda
ceased to be the exclusive property of the Hindus and become the common
heritage of all South Asians?  Was the Veda ever the exclusive property of
Hindus? What about the Buddhists and Jains who reject the authority of the
Vedas?  How do these communities conceive of the Vedas and how do they
respond to other communities' appropriation of the concept Veda?  Can the
concept of Veda, as it is appropriated by different religious communities
in South Asia, be used as a bridge for interreligious understanding and
dialogue, or has its appropriation created misunderstandings and
barriers?  How does an understanding of Veda in its different contexts
lead us to a better understanding of these religious communities
differences and similarities?

The Dharam Hinduja Indic Research Center
at Columbia University

Mary McGee, Director
Associate Professor of Classical Hinduism

The Dharam Hinduja Indic Research Center was established at Columbia
University in 1994 with three primary goals: a) deepening and advancing
research on Indic traditions of learning; b) addressing practical problems
in the modern world, especially those that come within the purview of
science and medicine; and c) advancing the causes of tolerance and
interreligious understanding.  Through academic research, educational
workshops, publications, and outreach, the Hinduja Center seeks to foster
an environment in which research scholars can pursue the contributions of
Indic cultures to human civilization, while investigating how those
contributions may advance solutions to problematic issues present in many
of our cultures today, such as illness, violence, prejudice, and the
decline of our environment. 

Much of the Center's research is channeled through its small working
groups, which draw together scholars with shared concerns and enable them
to advance their research collaboratively.  Currently five working groups
are actively pursuing research centered around the following concerns: 

* Ayurveda and Indic Traditions of Healthcare
* Gender & Traditional Authority in Indic Religions
* Indic Traditions of Conflict Management
* The Exact Sciences in Indic Traditions
* The Relevance of the Veda
