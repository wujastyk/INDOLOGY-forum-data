I received the following from W. Callewaert, who is not a member of this 
listserv.
F. Smith
Univ. of Iowa


4-year Post-Doctoral Research Fellowship at KU, Leuven (Belgium), under the 
direction of Professor Winand Callewaert, beginning 1st October 1996.  The 
Research Fellow will work on a Nirguna-Bhakti Hindi-English dictionary, being 
compiled from existing textual databases that include the full text of the 
Guru Granth Sahib, the Nirguna Bhakti Sagar, and the Gopaldas Sarvangi.  A 
candidate for this position should have extensive knowledge of pre-modern 
Hindi bhakti literature in its various dialects, as well as basic computer 
skills.  This project has been generously funded by the Research Fund of KU 
Leuven University, Department of Asian Studies, and the salary will include a 
very adequate living stipend as well as a generous benefits package (details 
available on inquiry). Because of the long-term and painstaking nature of 
this work, applicants willing to commit themselves to four years will be 
preferred, but those who may be able to come for two years, with a 
possibility of renewal for a further two years, may also be considered.  A 
complete application should include CV, and three letters of reference, and 
should be mailed to the address below, to arrive no later than 15 August 
1996: 
Prof. Winand Callewaert
Blijde Inkomststraat 21, Department of Asian Studies
3000 Leuven, Belgium 
(tel. 32 16 324945)
