Q: New Year

In Tamil Nadu & Kerala, New Year day was celebrated on April 13, 1996.
This is following Solar calendar (When Sun enters Mesha Rasi.)
In Andhra & Karnataka, it was 20 days earlier (Yugadhi following
lunar calendar)

Does Bengal follow Solar calendar too? Sinhala New Year was on
Apri 13, 1996 (solar). Thais and Khmer also follow solar calendar,
I heard. Is it true? Any other people following Indic calendars??
