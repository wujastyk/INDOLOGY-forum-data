Sogdian Buddhists
of the
Zoroastrians
Buddhism.
Checking the Columbia University Library catalogue, I find 
a bibliography by David A. Utz,
_A survey of Buddhist Sogdian studies_
(Tokyo: Reiyukai Library, 1980).
Also I suspect there is some mention of the Sogdians in Erik Zurcher's 
_Buddhist Conquest of China._
