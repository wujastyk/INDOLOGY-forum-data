typing Indic
Yes, I would be very happy to have such scheme, particularly if it is 
accepted by most of the list members. That would make this never ending 
discussion much more fruitful.
In that context I'd like to ask Lars Martin Fosse and other users of the 
Tubingen Zurich formate (TZ) for Sanskrit (which I really prefer to the 
other ones proposed here):   Has there been any attempt to type Dravidian 
languages by extending the repertory of TZ format for the above mentioned 
peculiar phonemes (while preserving the already-defined-for-Sanskrit way 
of marking phonemes identical with Skt) ?  If so, share it with us ...
This should count in the fights which scheme is "better"; it will 
obviously be the one allowing one smoothly combine lggs of all the Indian 
language groups.
