   In the light of the suggestion that magic [weltanschaung] seems 
  to play a crucial   role in Vedic world-view especially through its 
  relation to rhetorics or poetics I should like to  recall
  Paul Thieme's review of L.Renou's EVP I in JAOS 1956(?), where  
  he already called the phenomenon "magical poetics"   (or was it 
  "poetical  magic" ?- sorry, if my memory   fails me).
