I am a subscriber to the Indology list and a student of Prof. Rukmani at 
Concordia University; unfortunately she does not have an E-Mail address. 
The Concordia Religion Department phone number is (514) 848-2065. Unfortunately
my computer account at the university will be terminated shortly and I 
will be unsubscribing from the list sson.
