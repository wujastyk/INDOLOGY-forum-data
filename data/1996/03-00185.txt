New Indologist Web Page
Will,
a very nice focused collection. Thank you.
I've been getting the same response from that site for the last week.
In fact, it is not just the jain document, but the entire web site
(which comes from DeMontfort University) which seems to be down... I
haven't noticed this behavior from any others...
