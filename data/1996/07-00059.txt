basketball (3-on-3 ?)
Madhav's suggestion sounds good to me. And in fact, when I asked my Sri 
Lankan friend Gamini Wickramasinghe about this, he noted that his 
country's national team is known as the TripiTaka-kanduka-kriDaa-sangham. 
Unfortunately, they won't be playing in Atlanta.  :-(
best, Tim
