Film on Holi
under the circumstances, it is understandable that there is a past 
evaluative weight placed upon the term chaos.  however, the term "racist" 
is equally offensive and does not assist the quality of this dialogue.
further, to absolutize the "one and only meaning" of chaos, as suggested 
below, is to also keep earnestly alive the ignorant and childish 
attitudes of early western indologists (and, sadly, current ones).  
further, linguistically and semantically word meanings are not absolute, 
unchanging, and eternal.  to try and maintain such a position does 
obeisance to the very hegemony perpetrated by the socio-political 
vicissitudes of english which, it appears, RAJAGOPALANM at HARPO wishes to 
see handled differently and more sensitively.
