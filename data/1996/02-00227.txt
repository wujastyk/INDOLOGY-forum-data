To those interested in modern Indian language word processing programs:

While in Pune this past summer, I had the pleasure of talking with several
researchers at the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing [CDAC} about
the possibility of a Sanskrit word processing program that was as
sosphsticated as their programs for all major Indian languages, Arabic et
al.  Though they have not yet developed the Sanskrit program promised me
within six months, they do have exceptional programs for the modern Indian
languages--including Urdu.  This includes both the Indian scripts and Roman
alphabet and the ability to move between them.  If you want to talk further
with them, you may wish to get in touch with someone at CDAC which is on the
campus of Pune University, Ganesh Khind, Pune  411 007.  The email address
for Dr. N. Subramanian at CDAC is subs at parcom.ernet.in.  Their prices are
about US $325 for a program of one Indian language and a little more if you
have two or more Indian languages on a program.  Good luck.
