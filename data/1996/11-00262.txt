    I finally got around to browsing the Hemphill, Lukacs and Kennedy
paper in Harappa Excavations 1986--1990. I will summarize the relevant
facts from there.
They give the results of cluster analysis and tree diagrams, as well
as principal component results for craniometric, dental non-metric and
cranial non-metric data. These three are not done on the same samples.
Cranometric:
Samples used are Harappa Cemetry 37A and 37B (Harappan phase),
Harappa Cemetry H open burials and pot/jar burials, Chatal Huyuk 
(Turkey, 5000-64 BCE), Tell al-Judiadah (Palestine?, 5000-64 BCE),
Kish (2900-2800 BCE), Tepe Hissar 2 and 3 (dates given as 3500-3000
and 3000-2000 BCE, but may have to be revised), Naqada (7000-5000 BCE),
Abydos (I dynasty), Badaria (Predynasitc) [last three Egypt?],
Napalese (Modern), Tibeans (Modern), Veddahs (modern), Sedement
(9th Dynasty), Mohenjodaro, and Timagarha (1400-800 BCE).
Cluster analysis of the Prehistoric polpulations from Indus valley
alone give Mohenjodaro as the outlier, with Timagarha and R37A
closely related to each other. The relationship of others differes a
bit when sex is taken into account. but in both cases, are more
closely related to Timagarha-R37A than to Mohenjodaro.
When modern populations are added, they group together, and more closely
related to Mohenjodaro than the rest. When all samples are used,
Cemetry H (Jar burials) are closest to Chatal Huyuk, Timagarha-R37A to
Tepe Hissar, Cemetry H (open burials) to Kish, and Mohenjodaro to
Badaria. The modern populations seperate out from all the prehistoric ones.
Dental Non-metric:
Samples used are Harappa, Chalcolithic Mehrgarh (4500 BCE),
Neolithic Mehrgarh (6000 BCE), Inamgaon (1600-700 BCE), Mahadaha (8000 BCE),
Timagarha and Sarai Khola (200-100 BCE).
Timagarha and Sarai Khola are closer to each other than others, 
Chalcolithic Mehrgarh and Harappa to each other, Neolithic Mehrgarh and
Inamgaon to each other and next to Ganga Valley.
Cranial Non-metric:
Samples used are Harappa, Egypt (4000 BCE), Ancient Palestine (700 BCE),
Modern Palestine, Modern Punjabi, Modern Burmese, Modern Bedouin,
Mahadaha, Lidar (2300-2000 BCE), Kamid el-Loz (500 BCE), and Sarai Khola.
Harappa is closest to Modern Palestine and then to Ancient Palestine;
this group is closest to the pair Kamid el-Loz and Lidar. The others
form the second major break-out, with further clustering as follows:
Mahadaha and Modern Punjabis pair and are closest to Modern Burmese;
this group's nearest neighbor is Sarai Khola; the next one out is
Egypt and all of the second group are closer to Modern Bedouins than
to those of the first group.
I fail to see how anyone can conclude that there is a demagrphic break
in Indus Valley between 1700 BCE and 800 BCE. Timagarha is closer to
R37 than any of the three are to Mohenjodaro in craniometric analysis.
