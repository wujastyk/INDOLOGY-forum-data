For the history of "Barbara Allen" see _The English and Scottish
Popular Ballads_, edited by Francis James Child in five volumes
(1882-1898; reprinted by Dover) [with notes by a Sanskritist,
Charles Rockwell Lanman], Vol. 2 pp. 276ff.  Of all the Scottish
ballads this is the one most widely attested in America.
