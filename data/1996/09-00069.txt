Sanskrit in scientific terminology
When Mendeleev introduced his periodic system of elements in 1867, he 
predicted that the gaps in the table would be filled by as yet 
undiscovered elements with certain properties that he specified.  He 
named his predicted elements by prefixing the Sanskrit numerals eka-, 
dvi-, tri-, shchatur- [sic] to the names of the corresponding known 
elements.  (Unfortunately, the predicted elements were given new 
nationalistic names when they were later discovered, e.g. Mendeleev's 
"eka-aluminium" became gallium, "eka-boron" became scandium, 
"eka-silicon" became germanium, "dvi-tellurium" became polonium, and 
"tri-manganese" became rhenium.)
Why did Mendeleev use Sanskrit terminology here rather than Greek or
Latin as is normal?  Could it be that he knew about the Sivasutras?
If he did, he must have seen that they are really a periodic system of
the Sanskrit sounds, amazingly similar to his own periodic system of
chemical elements even in their arrangement. So could the Sanskrit
names have been meant as homage to Panini?
This raises the question how much Sanskrit Mendeleev knew.  He taught
at St. Petersburg.  Could someone tell me what Sanskritists were there
in the 1860's?  When were Boethlingk and Roth there?
The only other use of Sanskrit in scientific terminology that I know
about is the modern term "antarafacial".  Does anyone know of others?
