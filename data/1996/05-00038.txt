Follow-up
Dear Members,
I am hoping not to breach netiquette with this follow-up.  If so, please 
forgive my persistence.  I am still hoping, however, to learn from any of 
you who have worked with the Nirukta about resources dealing with 
yaaska's choice of shruti examples, and the overall place Nirukta holds 
in later commentatorial traditions.  The information in response to 
kaarikaa has been most enlightening considering I had not even initiated 
the request.  I imagine, in turn, others may find information re. Nirukta 
of interest as well.
Again, in advance, my thanks,
John Robert Gardner
