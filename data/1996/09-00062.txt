	In response to the request posted by Beatrice Reusch, appended, 
note the WWW links provided by the University of Virginia at
	http://www.virginia.edu/~soasia/links.html
that include the following US university centers for study of South 
Asia: University of California at Berkeley, University of Chicago, 
Columbia University, Cornell University, University of Pennsylvania, 
University of Texas at Austin, Univrsity of Virginia, University of 
Washington, and University of Wisconsin at Madison.
	The convenient set of links from the University of Virginia is 
augmented (but only slightly) on a page at my individual web site:
	http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/gthursby/linkndia.htm
which offers a separate link to the Center for Advanced Study of India 
at the University of Pennsylvania (in addition to the South Asia 
Regional Center).
