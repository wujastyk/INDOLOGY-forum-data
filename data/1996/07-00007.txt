what is a jalabIna?
Dear listmembers
In a passage about observing the moon in a Hindi text I am working on there
is a mention of a dUrbIna (telescope) and another device called a *jalabIna*
(a 'waterscope'?)
I can find no reference to a jalabIna so far. Has anyone else ever seen this
word, or even better a *jalabIna* itself!
