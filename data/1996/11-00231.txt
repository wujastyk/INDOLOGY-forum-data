Very interesting. I read the article in the San Francisco Chronicle, and I
have a question.
The suggestion of the article is that the "ants" were really marmots, and
Michel Peissel "says that his favored explanation is that confusion set in
because in Persian the word for marmot is equivalent to mountain ant."
Could anyone tell us what this Persian word is, and its etymology?  Is there
a Sanskrit word for marmot?
