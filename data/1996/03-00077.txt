Elizarenkova
Dear Mr. Thompson,
My colleague at the Kern Institute, Marianne Oort, keeps in touch with
Prof. Elizarenkova. She gave me her adress: 
T.V. Elizarenkova
Russia 125315
Moscow A-315
uL. Sameda Varguna
d.5, kv 49
I have transcribed it following a handwritten adress on an envelope, and I am 
not sure that I have got all the characters exactly right.
Perhaps you should check with Mrs Oort, 
e-mail KERNLIBORT at RULLET.LeidenUniv.NL.
Yours,
Ellen Raven
