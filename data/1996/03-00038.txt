Dear Dr Houben,

As far as I can deduce, after scrutinizing the messages you forwarded
with a very intense scrut, your "help set" message was apparently
inadvertently sent not to listserv at liverpool..., but to
indology at liverpool....  The listserv software noticed that your message
looked more like a command than something it should send to all the
members.  However, you have sent it to them anyway :-(

Try again, making sure you post to "listserv at liverpool.ac.uk".


Best wishes,
Dominik
