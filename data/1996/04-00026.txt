Debates
Bimal Matilal's inaugural lecture at Oxford, entitled "The logical
illumination of Indian mysticism" contained quite a lot on the formal
rules of debate as presented in nyaya literature.  I think this essay
was reprinted somewhere in one of his later books.  He also discussed
this topic in section 1.2 "Rule[s] of dialectic an debate" in his  book
_Logic, Language & Reality_ (Delhi: Motilal, 1985).  In the latter
referenence, Bimal also describes the rules of debate that are presented
in the Carakasamhita.
