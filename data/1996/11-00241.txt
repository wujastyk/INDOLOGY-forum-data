Sati
There are extensive lists of references to the story of Sati's dismemberment
in (1) _Hindu_Myths_ (the Penguin Classics edition, trans. by Wendy Doniger
O'Flaherty); and (2) _The_Sakta_Pithas_ , by D.C. Sircar (Motilal
Banarsidass, 1973; the entire book is about the pilgrimage sites that sprang
up where the parts
of Sati's body fell).
