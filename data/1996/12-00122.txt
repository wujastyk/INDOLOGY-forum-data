Assamese and Bengali programs
Someone asked me where in the US or Canada they might be able to study
Assamese or Bengali.  I know Chicago has Bengali, but don't know what other
schools offer it; nor do I know of any school that offers Assamese.  Does
anyone any schools that offer these languages, or where I might find this
information?  
Thanks in advance,
