Conspiracy theory
Picking up on what Tim Cahill said concerning Smith's ideas and theories 
(I haven't read the book), it would be helpful to compare the Jaina 
classification and analysis of the "universe," as their system has 
similar goals with respect to "control." Similar in the sense that the 
Jaina analysis of the world and its contents is equally inclusive and 
meticulous as the Brahmanic (perhaps even more so), with the idea in mind 
that one successfully negotiates release from the world (rebirth) when 
one fully understands and "controls" one's living in it. Additionally, 
and noteworthy in the context of the "conspiracy theory," is the fact 
that varna is anathema in Jainism.
