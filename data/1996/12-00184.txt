Reply to Peter J. Claus,
I am, incidentally, writing a thesis on devadasi dances of Andhra, and as you are well 
aware, the theme is a central narrative not only in the repertoire of the gudisanis 
(temple dancers), but also the Brahmin dramatic traditions of villages such as Kucipudi 
and Melattur (in TN).  I was actually looking for Sanskrit sources which present the 
narrative in a less elaborated format.  A couple of the references which I had mentioned 
were given to me by devadasi informants themselves (ie. BhagP and VisnuP).  I was 
wondering if there are other sources either Sanskrit or vernacular which my help in 
observing the diffusion of the myth in liturature.
