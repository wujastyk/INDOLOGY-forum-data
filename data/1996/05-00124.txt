Guru-paramparaa
Dear Allen,
Thanks for the reference to the Guruparamparacarita by Ramakrsnasomayajin
(Bombay: Sri Venkatesvara Press, 1907-08). Actually, I was looking for
Jagad-guru-ratna-maalaa... a few months ago. I got to see a copy that book
in Madras. The title you have specified also seems interesting. I hope to
be able to look at it one of these days. -- ashok
