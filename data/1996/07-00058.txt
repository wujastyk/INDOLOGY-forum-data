basketballs
	The traditional word in Sanskrit for a playing ball is kanduka.  
It occurs frequently in Sanskrit dramas, e.g. Svapnavaasavadattam.  Now 
'basketball' would need a new coinage.  How is PiTakakandukam? I am sure 
the All India Radio broadcasters from Delhi who report the news in 
Sanskrit must have coined a term.  Any Delhi-wallahs on Indology?
