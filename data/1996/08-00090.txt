Official State Languages query
We *could* certainly be pragmatic about it, but the problem this leads to
is discrimination against speakers of languages that continue to be
treated politically as dialects: one obvious way in which they are
discriminated against is that as long as their languages are considered
'dialects' they cannot claim the right to have schools in their own
languages. Thus, Marwari speakers can potentially demand this right based
on the definition of a language as one that possesses a script and written
literary tradition, but speakers of various adivasi (tribal) languages
cannot.
