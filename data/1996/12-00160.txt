Arch. Dr. Ludovico Magnocavallo is designing the *Nina* fonts for devanagari in Windows 
TrueType, Macintosh TrueType, and Adobe Type 1 (both WIndows/Dos/Unix and Macintosh 
versions), together with a set of macros for conversion to and from the CS/CSX encoding.

They will be free and available in our ftp server:
ftp://ftp.shore.net/members/india/

Any suggestion from users will be more than welcomed.

You can read his announcement of the Nina fonts in the last issue of the *International 
Journal of Tantric Studies*, Vol. 2 (1996), No. 2, November 29, 
http://www.shore.net/~india/ijts/

For typing devanagari in the Windows environment see the Derick Miller, "Typing 
Devanagari on a Standard Keyboard", in *IJTS* Vol. 2 (1996), No. 1, April 10, 
http://www.shore.net/~india/ijts/ 
(Mr. Miller, who is a MA in Sanskrit and worked as a Senior Quality Assurance Engineer, 
also offers a review of the UniType International and the ILKEYB). 

I hope this helps.
