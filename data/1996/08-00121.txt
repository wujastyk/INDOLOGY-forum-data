There are several other published papers.

I think you have put your finger on the one significant weakness in
Salomon's otherwise excellent paper. Possibly it was drafted before fuller
information had become available on the Anuraadhapura finds.

There is now enough radiocarbon evidence to rule out a complete invention
during the reign of Asoka. Of course the potsherds evidence only particular
letters not the whole alphabet.

I doubt whether the material from Ceylon would prohibit the possibility of
a deliberate invention early in the reign of Candragupta (accession between
325 B.C. and 302 B.C.). It would suggest rapid communication between
Maaagadha and Anuraadhapura, if it is assumed that the invention took place
in Maagadha. But trade and other links make that fairly likely anyway.

Alternatively, the invention could have taken place on the island of Ceylon
- not impossible if that was already a maritime communication link between
the Near East and South Asia.
