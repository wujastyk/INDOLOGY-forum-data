Asking your help to find the full address
Dear Colleagues,
I need to send an urgent letter to the  Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts 
and Sciences, Amsterdam.  However, I do no have its full address or its 
FAX number. Could any of you help me in this regard?  I would very much 
appreciate it.  
Best,
