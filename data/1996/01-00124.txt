collyrium stick// Guru Gita vs. 34
Dear Dr. Kellner
Tulsidas (1532-1608?) in his Ramacaratimasa writes (1.6)
"When a student or an experienced master of magic put a potent magic 
ointment (suanjana) in his eye,
the see sees a marvelous spectacle: numerous treasures hidden in 
mountains, forests, and in the earth"
Nusrati (17th ct.) writes in his Gulshan-i 'ishq (1033)
When you show me the way and I can find this magic eye ointment (anjan),
then in my eyes this treasure will appear"
said about a dervish who is difficult to find.
In these mathnawis there appears also forest called Kajali about which I 
have written in JAOS 109, p.529
Sincerely
Peter Gaeffke
