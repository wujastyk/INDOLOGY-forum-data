You might be right that in the present the status of accompanists is not 
important anymore.
But first, I'm looking for facts form the social history of the music 
community in Hindustani music.
I had during my last travel in India a discussion with a sarangiya in 
Varanasi about his music tradition and the gharana aspect. Earlier I read 
that gharanas can only established by vocalists and solists in the 
Hindustani music context.
But this sarangiya argued that he is a member of the Banaras gharana and 
that there are 8 gharanas in Uttar Pradesh established by sarangi-players.
Later I had another discussion with a vocalist from Bombay who denied 
this fact told me by the sarangiya.
I tried to go further and to find answers to this two opposite facts. I 
think I should get some answers by doing research about the social 
situation when the court music developed, khayal came to the courts, 
courtesan tradition influenced the musical life in Northern India etc.
The answer to the question about caste, do musicians have their own caste, 
and differ the caste of vocalists from the caste of accompanists? might 
give some new lights.
I do know, that tablayas established their own gharana (Kippen's book: 
The tabla of Lucknow), but I don't understand why the sarangiyas did't 
got the chance. And if sarangiyas established their gharanas, why 
vocalists deny them. This one discussion with the vocalist and professor 
from Bombay is not the only reference I got about the attitude of 
vocalists to sarangiyas. In literature you can find the same attitude.
