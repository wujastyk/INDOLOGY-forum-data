A Tibetan misunderstanding of Skt.?
I just came across what seems perhaps to be a strange Tibetan
mis-translation.  I wonder if anyone else has ever seen such a thing.
rnal 'byor ma lags so //  seems (?!) to intended as a rendering of na
yujyate.  Has anyone ever seen this?  (This is from a suutra translation in
the Kanjur, not a "saastra.)
Thanks, Jonathan
