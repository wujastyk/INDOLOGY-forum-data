According to R.L. Turner, a Comparativel Dictionary of Indo-Arian Languages 
dakSiNa (349b, [6119]) has the meaning of 'right (hand)' in the RgVeda,
'southern' in AtharvaVeda. Derivatives in modern languages share both meanings.
dakSiNA (f.) [ibid 6120] 'Fee to a priest' RgVeda, 'gift' Manu.

The connection between 'right hand' and 'sacrificial fee' is quite easy to
analyze in the light of M. Mayrhofer's Kurzgefasstes etymologisches Woerterbuch
des Altindischen (Band 2 Heidelberg, 1963) p.10 SV dakSiNaH, 'right, southern,
able, dexterous' (since RgVeda); and p.27 SV dazasyati 'serves, obliges,
favours' : the meaning 'southern' comes from the direction situated at the right
side of someone looking towards the east (the rising sun); the right hand is
dexterous; dakSiNA f. is a 'sacrificial fee' i.e. the gift rewarding an act
accomplished to the satisfaction of the sacrificer (Cf. Mayrhofer, SV. dakSati;
Turner [6116] dakSa- 'able, clever', [6117] dakSate 'is able').

Obviously, the derivation from dA (to give?) and kSa (??) is  wrong, but it may
be interesting to find out why it was suggested. 
As we all know, sk. putra-, the word for son, has no linguistic connection with
put+tra ('protecting from the hell named 'put', cf., inter alia, Mn.9.138), no
grammarian would ever have taken it seriously. It seems to me that such
derivations were not produced through some kind of delirium, but answered a
need:  their social conotation was strong enough to overcome 'scientific'
(critical) knowledge. 
Members of this list have recently made fun about indian etymologies of european
proper names (Shakespeare) and pointed that it was a means of alleviating some
kind of 'inferiority complex'. This is certainly true, but could not the study
of  the use, as an irrefutable argument, of (sometimes fantastic) etymology  in
indian literature, be an interesting subject of dicussion ?
