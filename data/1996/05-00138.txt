	In response to Ruth Schmidt's question, I would like to inform
that U of Michigan is definitely teaching a 7 week intensive Hindi-Urdu
summer course this year.  Anyone still interested may contact the Center
for South and Southeast Asian Studies, U of Michigan.  The email address
to contact our administrator Les Adler is:  leadler at umich.edu.  The
instructor for Hindi-Urdu will be Dr. Tahsin Siddiqi.
