Request for information
Can someone direct me to any work which has been done on invective or
verbal abuse in sanskrit or prakrit literature, or discussions of those
subjects in the literatures themselves? In his commentary to the
vinayapiTaka Buddhaghosa quots from an akkosaniddesa, so it appears that
such treatments were not entirely unknown. Needless to say the study of
maledicta can provide important social and cultural information. Thanks in
advance. Leonard Zwilling
