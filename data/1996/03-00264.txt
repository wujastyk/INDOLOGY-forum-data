Lords
Hi,
I have already thanked the members who have answered to my previous question
in a private mail. I now have another question and I would be very grateful if
anyone could provide an answer.
Consider the following well known verse praising gaNesha:
			Om
gaNanaM tvaa gaNapati gvaM havaamahe |
priyaanaaM tvaa ....
and the nandii stuti:
mahaakaayaM mahaaviiryaM shivavaahanamuttamam.h |
gaNanaaM prathamaM vande nandiishvaraM mahaabalam.h ||
Are both of them lords of the gaNas of shiva?
Many thanks beforehand for your comments.
Bye,
Girish Beeharry
