Film on Holi
Dear F.R.5.1. Philosophie,
The word chaotic theory is a part of mathematics . i teach mathematics . So i
say that. Chaos  in social terms is not complimentary . Many non-complimentary terms
terms have beenforced on Hindus and their culture in the past fifty years .
( one such word is Idols , when refering to hindu gods in temples ).
many indian scholars on indology have used such terms about hindu culture.
That is unfortunate that Indians did that .Such words which are insulting 
should not be used in describing a culture unless proved .Real scholarship
consists of knowing such difference .When such bad words have been used 
a wrong description is already being tried to be established . that is not scientific.
scientific.If such a traditon to use insulting words on a culture was 
mistakenly established it is time to get it corrected by real scholars.
