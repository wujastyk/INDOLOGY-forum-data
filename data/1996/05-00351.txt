Surely, most recensions of the Rgveda have not survived ? That at any rate
was my impression, but I may have misunderstood.

This seems to me to be a considerable exaggeration and likely to be rather
misleading to those who do not know the facts.

To some extent, it depends what you are working on. If you are interested
in the kind of thing that the tradition was interested in (e.g.
abhidhamma), it is extremely rare to find any significant deviation and for
most matters the text is firmly fixed by the commentarial tradition. If it
concerns  matters of other kinds, then sometimes the texts are less secure.
Even so, this should not be exaggerated. A great many changes are editorial
rather than substantial. (I don't believe von Hinueber would disagree with
this.) Of course, it is still important to establish all the details.

The difference with the Vedic texts, of course, is that the exact words of
the Pali texts were relatively unimportant to the tradition; it was the
Dhamma which they wanted to preserve. There was less of a tie with ritual
and magical uses where the exact sound matters.

I don't think that the PTS editions represent a kind of synthesis of the
four versions. It varies greatly and for some texts only very few
manuscripts were available. In a few cases only an oriental edition was
available. I think everyone involved in Pali studies has long been aware
that all the texts badly need systematic reediting. But we can't do that
until the manuscripts are properly collected and available. Unfortunately
that is nowhere in sight. And there simply isn't the man-power, given the
extremely small numbers of available workers at present.

There are of course more than four versions, since there are newer and
older editions e.g. of the Thai and Sinhalese versions. Regional variations
in various scripts are found in manuscript.

Or, are you suggesting that the readings of the other four have now been
added to the PTS edition for the Dhammakaya CD ?

To my knowledge, the Dhammakaaya Foundation's intent has varied a number of
times during this period (and earlier).

At the moment the advantage of the IBRIC version is that you can get the
page references to both the PTS and the BJT editions simultaneously. Since
in practice you have to check everything in the printed texts, this speeds
up the process.

Since the BJT edition is one of the most recent and was done with more of a
critical sense than the earlier oriental editions, you can also find some
useful variants cited from the Siamese editions and from the Burmese
edition published in the 1950s and 60s (after the PTS editions).

When I was shown the first phase in Bangkok in 1990, there were still a
number of errors to a page. (I thought that to get to this point was
already a considerable achievement.)

The commentaries will be included in an updated version for Windows 'by
December 1997'. So it is a question of Dhammakaya not being ready, rather
than the PTS 'allowing'.

As far as I know, the PTS has never claimed that every text it publishes is
still in copyright. But some certainly are and that is what they have
claimed. I don't think there is any possibility of disputing their legal
right to do this.

The work that the PTS does and has done is of great value to Pali studies.

Well, you can't be referring to the PTS, since that is in Britain -
definitely no part of Europe :-)

>Let us return to this topic 10 years from now...

I suspect that the death of the book is still a long way away. I don't see
the need for an either/or mentality.

I myself disagreed with the initial PTS policy over this and inflicted
several memoranda upon them about it, making myself unpopular in the
process. So I am happy to see a reasonable compromise emerge. Much of the
problem was created by someone in Dhammakaya telling them (or giving them
the erroneous impression) that Dhammakaya were on the verge of producing a
free CD containing all PTS texts and translations of both Canon and
Commentaries.

Clearly, whatever may be the case with Oldenberg's Vinaya, the copyright of
many of the translations has been assigned  to the PTS with the intention
that it should help to fund future work in Pali studies. Nobody else has a
right to subvert that intent. So it is a matter of negotiation.

I have some sympathy with some of Dominik's remarks here and agree that a
policy of advertising would have been more constructive. No doubt it will
come in time.
