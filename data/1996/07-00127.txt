how to reference list discussions
Dear Colleagues:
The Chicago Manual of Style (14th ed.) has a small section devoted to
electronic documents (pp. 633-634).  They suggest writing to the following
address for the latest information on the matter from the International
Standards Organization (ISO), to which the Univ. of Chicago Press
subscribes:
ISO TC46/Sc 9
Secretariat: Office of Library Standards
National Library of Canada
Ottawa K1A 0N4
Canada
I already wrote to them, and they replied.  It would be too long to copy
their whole reply, but they said that information about ISO standards is
available on the Web at:

Sincerely,
Luis Gonzalez-Reimann
