The collyrium or other ointments used to anoint the eyes are I believe 
regarded as medicinal as well as cosmetic.  In addition to ordinary 
anjana there are special ones for medical conditions and also for occult 
powers (seeing through walls, becoming invisible, etc.). But the everyday 
ones are regarded as improving the eyesight.
