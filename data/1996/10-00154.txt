As I understand it, what prof. Tokunaga has a well-deserved copyright on is
not the Mahabharata itself, but his particular electronic version of it;
just as a translator of a classical text owns the copyright to his
particular translation, but not to the text itself.  In that sense, yes, I
suppose the BORI has the copyright to the critical edition.
