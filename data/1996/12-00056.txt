Numeric notation in the SV and related works.
To Mr. Fuji,
Thank you for the citation, but the copy our libraries have here seem to
be missing. Alas! Probably stuck somewhere on a reshelving cart. Is this a
rather easy to acquire text? If so, perhaps an inter-library loan is in
order.
The latter text I can get (Kumbakonam), the Boehtlingk I cannot.
Nonetheless, I will refer to this to examine the differences.
Thank you for your time.
Regards,
Anshuman Pandey
