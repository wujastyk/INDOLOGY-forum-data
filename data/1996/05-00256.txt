Subject: [Q]jyoti.h'saastra - what is "catarchic"?
Message-ID: <161227024588.23782.3377373947693396781.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

A student at our institute wants to study jyoti.h'saastra and came across
the expression "catarchic astrology". Would any of the distinguished
list-members know what it means? We could't find this expression in any
available dictionary. 

TIA,
