Hinduism Textbooks for Hindu Readership
	Can anyone recommend references on the history of the development
of textbooks on Hinduism for use in India in the 19th and 20th century? 
The Theosophical Society produced some in English.  Doubtless there were 
others.
	Has this topic been heavily worked already?  Do any accounts come 
to mind?  References and recommendations would be most welcome.
