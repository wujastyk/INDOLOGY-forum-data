Does anybody know a reliable (quotable) publication on the religion(s) of the 
Sogdians? What I need to know for sure is that they were not only Zoroastrians 
but also Buddhists and that they contributed in the propagation of Buddhism.
I?ve found only one very short reference by Oskar von Hinueber so far and I 
could use some more.
We?ve got lots (over 500) Sogdian inscriptions in Shatial (Upper Indus Valley, 
Pakistan), some of them seemingly in connection with drawings of Stupas, and I 
try to determine whether they do belong together or not.
In case Nicholas Sims-Williams reads this, sorry for not asking you directly!
