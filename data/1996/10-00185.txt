Vikram Seth - some more problems
One answer and three suggestions for Jan Dvorak:
kaminii (in Bengali) is a plant with sweet-smelling flowers; the word is
also used for "woman" or "wife"  (jasmine is cameli--pron. chameli)
Perhaps this is (also Bengali) ch?a (cuya with the "u" nasalized), which
can mean smelling badly, like smoke in particular) + uTha, to rise or
ascend.
rat is "night" in Bengali--might, then, be a term of endearment for a lover?
If the term comes from Bengali, it would suggest either "moon," if the "ch"
isn't aspirated, or "fashion," if it is.
