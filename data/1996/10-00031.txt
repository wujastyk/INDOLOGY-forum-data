I would have thought the same too. However, in the case of the deity being
too close to the back wall, one has to rotate clockwise (once or thrice
etc but never twice; I wonder why)  in front of the deity; this is a bit
contradictory to the previous statement. Can anyone solve this 'problem'
please? Thanks.

In the North, sometimes the following shloka is uttered while
circumnabulating the deity:

yaani kaani cha paapaani janmaantara kR^itaaNi cha |
taani taani vinashyanti pradakshiNa pade pade ||

I am curious as to what the South people/Buddhists say. Thanks in advance.

Bye,
