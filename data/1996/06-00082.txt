references?
Dear Friends,
	I have in front of me a twenty-some year old typescript of two
studies on Grammatical Discussions in the Abhidharmako"sa and
Abhidharmako"savyaakhyaa by Nobuhiko Kobayahi.  The first one is titled:
"On the Word Pratiityasamutpaada: A discussion in the AKVyaakhyaa", and
the second is titled:  "Grammatical References in the AKV".  These were
done while Kobayahi was at the University of Toronto.  Does anyone know if
these were ever published?  Any reference of their publication?  Thanks 
in advance for any help.
	Madhav Deshpande
