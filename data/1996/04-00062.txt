Sujata's story
Dear friends,
	I am looking for reference(s) where the story of SujAta, the noble
lady who had a dream about the fasting SiddhArtha, and fed him at the conclusion
of his fast with food served in a golden plate. I am sure, this episode must be
described in some buddhist literature, but I don't know where. I will be
grateful if someone points me the right direction. Thanks.
regards,
Desikachary
