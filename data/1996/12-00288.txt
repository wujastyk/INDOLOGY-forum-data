FINAL CIRCULAR 


Dear Participants,

The conference is fast approaching.  You must be busy making necessary preparations for your journey to India. As the day of the conference is coming closer, the conference secreatariat has been flooded with e-mails/fax/letters.  The conference staff has been working overtime and inspite of this, it is possible that personal attention to some of your requirements may not have been given. Scheduling of papers has been one of the difficult jobs of the conference, since there are some last minute cancellations.  Special requests from scholars to schedule their papers on a particular date to suit their travel plans, have been taken care of.  Information about the paper schedule will be made available in the Registration Kit.

Please note that the inauguration of the conference will be held in the banquet hall of  VIDHANA SOUDHA, the Karnataka State Legislature Building, on 4th Jan 1997 (Saturday) at 10 am.  For security reasons, you need to carry the name tag provided in the Registration Kit to get entry into the banquet hall.  Registration Kit will be given to you on the day of Registration (3rd January) at the reception counter of  TARALABALU KENDRA, the conference secretariat, where all the academic sessions will be held.
