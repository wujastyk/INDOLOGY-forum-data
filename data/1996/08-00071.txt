Official State Languages query
The list of languages as they appear on Indian money in order should be 
revised as:

Sanskrit, Tamil, Telugu, Urdu
Hindi and English appear as frame languages, while other languages appear 
in a listed form.  The list of languages is alphabetically organized.  
There is no separate Rajasthani in the list.
