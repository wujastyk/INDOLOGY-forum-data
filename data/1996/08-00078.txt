Before leaving town for a few days, I thank the first eight of you (Peter
Banos, Peter Claus, Gail Coelho, Madhav Deshpande, Satyanad Kichenassamy,
Narayan S. Raja, Mittal Sushil and Dominik Wujastyk) for your immediate
replies! Gujarati's absence on my initial list was a typographical
oversight, but thanks Madhav for rectifying the alphabetical listing with
Marathi and Sanskrit.
