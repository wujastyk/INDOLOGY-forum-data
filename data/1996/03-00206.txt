A foot note prompted by the engrossing field-report by Peter Claus:
...
>During a fieldwork methodology workshop in India we made video of
>each of the stages of a wedding as practiced by Telugu-speaking
>Gollas (pastoralists) living in Karnataka.  During the stage when
>the couple is washed with turmeric, and then playfully smear
>large handfuls of turmeric on one another (the act resembling
>throwing a pie in someone's face!) the bride sits on the groom's
>right.  Later, as Dr. Bapat observed, after the garlanding, she
>stands to his left.
...
>They were indeed aware of it and laughed at our interest in the
>matter.  We suggested our interpretation of why it was done like
>it was.  They laughed again, harder.  The reason THEY gave was
>that with the bride on the groom's right, he could reach his
>right arm around her back and hold her firmly while he pasted her
>in the face with a handful of the turmeric!  Their explanation at
>first appeared purely practical: he could control (overcome) her
>better...*

* In much the same vein, but in total seriousness, my Sanskrit professor

My final comment on this thread (promise):
        the best student response to slide projections of ardhanArIzvara
icons, and to the question of why the female invariably occupies the left
half came from a senior-citizen auditor: instantly she shot back, "because
the heart is on the left."
