Right & Left
A foot note prompted by the engrossing field-report by Peter Claus:

* In much the same vein, but in total seriousness, my Sanskrit professor
(a Brahman, Aryasamajist Panjabi) once confided to his chelas that the
wife's appointed place at her husband's left side originated in bed: the

My final comment on this thread (promise):
        the best student response to slide projections of ardhanArIzvara
icons, and to the question of why the female invariably occupies the left
half came from a senior-citizen auditor: instantly she shot back, "because
the heart is on the left."
