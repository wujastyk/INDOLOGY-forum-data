Muni Jambuvijaya's Adress
As a Jain monk, Muni Jambuvijaya generally does not stay at one place for a
long time except during the rainy season. The only concession he has made
to himself in view of his scholarly and research interests (it is not easy
to transport the books he needs to all the places at which he resides) and
his advanced age is that his stays at any one place are not very short and
that he generally moves only in the radius of a few kilometres around the
sacred place of Sankheshwar/Shankheshwar.  The best way to arrange a
meeting with him is to write to the following address and find out where he
is likely to be at the time of the planned visit. The lay disciples
invariably ensure that Muniji gets the message. Muniji usually manages to
write back in a few days.
