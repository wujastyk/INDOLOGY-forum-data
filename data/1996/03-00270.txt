Subject: Rig Veda, A Metrically Restored Text Question on the Software
Message-ID: <161227023603.23782.9623514888473964646.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I recently purchased Rig Veda, A Metrically Restored Text. I am trying to work with the diskette to convert the diacritics. In the instructions there is a mention of a file called CONVERT.SG which accompanies the program SG.EXE. I do not see this file on the diskette. Is it embedded somewhere or was it not included in error. If it was not included would anyone know how I would obtain it? 

Thanks for the help.
