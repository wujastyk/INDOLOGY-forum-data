Reference Books on Sanskrit Linguistics and/or phonology
I don't have the book at hand here in the office, but a student of Madhav
Deshpande some years ago wrote a very interesting thesis on Skt pholology. 
(Sorry, that should be Phonology!)  It was published in a series -- but I
forgot the details -- Madhav??  Reference?
