On Thu, 01 Feb 1996 I gave some details on this year's offering of 

                 SUMMER SANSKRIT at HARVARD.


In the meantime, the definite catalogue has come out and the data below 
reflect this year's schedule, fees, etc.

I repeat the salient features below.

Like last year, I got several inquiries regarding our offering of Introductory 
Sanskrit this summer, -- taught here since 1988. Last summer's course (10 
"takers" from the mid-west to the south-east) was very enjoyable, indeed the 
best I have had here.
