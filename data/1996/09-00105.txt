Sanskrit-Chinese
I do not know if others have already addressed this question, but of course
there are a large number of indicies of Sanskrit / Chinese Buddhist texts.  A
good first source (without, however, precise references) is Wogihara Unrai,
Bonwa Daijiten, nominally a Skt. / Japanese dictionary, but more useful (to
nonJapanese anyway) for its Chinese translation quotations.
