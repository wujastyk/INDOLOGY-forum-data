Sanskrit for southeast
"aagneya" ("associated with agni") in Sanskrit is "southeast".
Does someone know if by some optional internal sandhi it can
also be "aaj~neya"?
There is an instance where the meaning of "southeast" would
seem to make sense for "aaj~neya" but I can not find it in
my dictionaries.
