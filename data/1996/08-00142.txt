typing Sanskrit
Thank you all for taking interest in BO.
Pullat Devadas Das have asked for the actual rendering of the whole sequence
of marks in BO. Here you are:
a, aa, i, ii,   u,  uu,  r_,  r_r_, l_, l_l_, e, ai, o, au,
k, kh, g, gh, n-, 
c, ch, j, jh, n~, 
t, th, d, dh, n, 
t_, t_h, d_, d_h, n_, 
p, ph, b, bh, m,  
y, r, l, v, 
s-, s_, s, 
h, h_ (visarga), 
m- (anusvara),  [if necessary: m=  (anunaasika), l-] .
In response to Jacob Cejka' letter:
Well, most of man's activity is not purely "natural". What I mean by natural
way of writing is the order of marking diacritics in the handwritten form.
Why I call it "normal practice"? For 1) I compare number of people who can
write with a pencil with number of people who can type; 2) I notice people
who can type with no exception can write with a pencil. So, all people (with
possible few exceptions) start with writing diacritics after a given letter
that need it. For them to get accustomed to mark diacritical mark  the way 
typewriter demands is not natural. You may call it "second nature" etc. but the
fact seems to be it is not convenient for most people (maybe for you or a
few other natural talents this is not true).
If you are interested in my humble opinion - YES, it is unnatural. For that
simple reason the way people speak is different from the way they write. Shall
I elaborate?
Composers rather don't type their compositions while composing them. And I
don't say you cannot learn all those systems. I say they very often go
against your earlier customs (in that sense they are unnatural) which makes
them inconvenient.

PS Polish also has diacritical marks as many other languages and if I
remember it right one either uses separate fonts or writes the way you
described it.
