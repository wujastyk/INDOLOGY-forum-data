I stand corrected!  I had noticed the obvious similarity of both
translations, but assumed (incorrectly, as I now learned) that Dutt's was
the earliest.
I was not aware of this.  The editions of Roy/Ganguli I have used do not
have verse numbers.
I can offer an example of a verse where the two translations differ, and in
which I think Dutt's is better.
Ganguli/Roy (vol. 10:566, Oriental Publishing Co. ed., no date):
"Upon the expiration of Dwapara, the Yuga that will set in will be called
Kali yuga which will come under the influence of Tishya constellation."
Dutt 12.341.81:
"Upon the termination of Dwapara, the cycle that will set in will be called
Tish, and it will come with Kali walking in the van."
My translation of CE 12.327.76a:
"Then, when the TiSya [Kali] yuga arrives preceded by misfortune/conflict
(kali)..."
