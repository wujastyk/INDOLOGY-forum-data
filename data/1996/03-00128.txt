Temples and shoes
It's nice that this tedious, dendentious, voluminous thread has lightened up
somewhat. While quarter 'c  of 
"AkAshAt patitam tOyam   yathA gachchati sAgaram
    sarva loka pAdarakshA:  pratigachchanti mAm tathA"
may not be metrically correct, Aklujkar's emendation of  c & d to:
"tathopaanaha aayaanti sarvaa maam ii a-mandiraat "
makes less sense to me. Might the learned nizAcara provide us with the
analysis of the sandhi of the last pada?
