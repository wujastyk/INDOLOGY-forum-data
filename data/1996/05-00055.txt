Devas and devils
Dan Lusthaus writes:
I'm sorry, but I still fail to see the evidence of connection between the
two sets of words. I know about the ambiguity of "deva" and "asura", of
course, but how can it be shown that "deva" is related to "diabolos" -- and
what about the "l" element? "Deva" *is* generally considered to have Greek
relations, e.g. "dios" = "divine", but I never heard "diabolos" suggested
before.
As for Hebrew scriptures, to my knowledge "diabolos" is supposed to be a
Greek translation of Hebrew "satan" (or whatever the correct transliteration
may be), meaning "adversary, enemy, prosecutor" and mentioned at least in
the book of Job. Of course, if there is evidence of use of this word in
pre-(Judeo)Christian Greek, there would seem to be a case for the "deva"
connection.
