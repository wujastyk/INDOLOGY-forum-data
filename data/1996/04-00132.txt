oriya instruction
Since nobody reacted to the query about Oriya instruction I may give  
the following lead:
the South Asian Department of the University of Heidelberg has worked for 
years  on its Oriya project of which many publications appeared. Prof. 
Kulke wrote the Oriya bibliography with contains many thousand  entries 
among them also about grammar and instruction. I assume that there is 
still knowledge about Oriya available in Heidelberg  or at least somebody 
there may know  more to satisfy the question.
