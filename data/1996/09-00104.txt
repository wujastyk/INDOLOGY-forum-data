On the subject of Chinese-Sanskrit and vice-versa dictionaries, a search on
Firstsearch (OCLC) under subject on the three terms Sanskrit, Chinese, and
Dictionaries produces 54 titles.  They are an interesting collection of
ancient and modern dictionaries.  Rather than trying to list all here, I
suggest to Joseph Kozono and others interested that they do the same search. 
If you have questions, ask your reference librarian.  The same search can be
done on RLIN.  The LC subject heading for S-C would be Sanskrit Language -
Dictionaries - Chinese.  Bill Alspaugh, Southern Asia Collection, University
