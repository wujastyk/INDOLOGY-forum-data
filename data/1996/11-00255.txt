Do you realize that you are making the discussion vague to the point
of being meaningless? We cannot bandy words and phrases like
"certain amount", "fair number" and "transnational" in this way without
stricter criteria. (And I may add here: all the persons who have spoken
up here in defense of the status quo of Hindi vs. other-modern-language
studies have been doing this. It is useless, quasi-statistical
argumentation in support of a myth.)

I have given here not a literary evaluation of Hindi vs. Kannada/Tamil,
but a very hard, totally objective historical fact that can be verified
by anyone. There is just much more history in Kannada and Tamil (and
other literatures) than in Hindi. This is simply _not_ a debatable
issue. And this is an Indologically crucial matter.

There are no quantitative arguments that stand rational, critical
investigation: that is the poor joke of this discussion. I must repeat:
before a quantitative argument has any force, a qualitative criterion
must first be established -- otherwise we don't know what we are
talking about, and the discussion becomes murky and useless. There is
nothing emotional about this - quite the contrary.
