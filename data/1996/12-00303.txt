Query re: Address of Chief Epigraphist to Govt. of India
Can an indology list colleague supply a postal (and if there is one,
e-mail) address for the Chief Epigraphist to the Government of India
at Mysore. Thanks in advance.  Somehow I have a memory that the status of
the Epigraphical Survey was altered, but I am unable to recall the
details.
thanks,
