Holaka
According to Stutley's Dictionary of Hinduism, Holaka is commonly called
Holi.  This book, refering to Monier-Williams Sanskrit English Dictionary,
suggests that the word Holaka is perhaps derived from a cry, shout or sound
in singing. 
 Auboyer's "Daily Life in Ancient India,"p. 144 is also suggested as a
further reference on the subject. 
Basham in "The Wonder that was India" states that the festival was originally
held in honor of Kama, the Love god.
