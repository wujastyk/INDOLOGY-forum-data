Calculus (was Re: Gymnosophists etc.)
The point is that neither was operating in a vacuum and they both knew
what had been done in previous generation. Tanget calculation,
area calculation and the relation between them was known earlier,
for example to Barrow.
Me too, but this is not irrelevant to the topic at hand. After all,
there would have been no calculus with out algebra and the
input from Islamic, and thus indirectly from Babylonian, Indian and
perhaps Chinese, cultures into European tradition is considerable
with respect to algebra. If we did not have knowledge of the
various translations done, this too might be ignored with ``there
is no direct evidence of borrowing''.
