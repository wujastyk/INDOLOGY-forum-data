My memory may be fading, but I recall seeing lots of sheep in the
highlands of Scotland in 1965 that had a patch of pink or orange on their
fleece.  Since in those days Eid was not often celebrated around
Inverness, I assumed it had to do with practical affairs of sheep herding.
Is it possible that worldly concerns intrude in South Asia as well?
