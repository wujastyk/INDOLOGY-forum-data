Why not a definitive devnagri font
kellner at hws.ipc.hiroshima-u.ac.jp (Birgit Kellner)  has  recently
written as follows:
That is no convention at all. We do not have any means of
communicating in Devnagri at all. What you propose translates into "If
I cannot have it my way :no one else should have it either"
Have a nice day.
