An Index to the AbhidharmakozabhaaSya (parts 1 & 2, ed. by A. Hirakawa, Daizo 
Shuppan, Tokyo 1973) would be very helpful. It cross-refers to the various 
versions of AKBh in Sanskrit, Tibetan and Chinese, so it works as a means to 
know the terminology of Hsuan Tsung and Paramaartha.

Mahaavyutpatti (vols 1 & 2, ed. by R. Sakaki, Suzuki Gakujutu Zaidan, Tokyo)
might be also useful.
