None
Dear Fred,
Greetings
Do you know where I can find information on anyonyabhava, atyantabhava,
etc. as aspects of arguement? I found a description of each in some text
several years ago, but I can't remember where (I looked in my Nyaya texts
without luck). I would like to have a primary and secondary source, if
possible.
Thanks so much,
