Subject: board-games: two articles
Message-ID: <161227023168.23782.14673527753025124939.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Two articles on "Sanskrit-studies and Board Games" appeared at a place where 
Sanskritists interested in the subject will perhaps not start searching, viz. 
in the IIAS Working Papers Series, vol. 3, New Approaches to Board Games 
Research: Asian Origins and Future Perspectives. Editor: A.J. de Voogt. 
Publisher: International Institute for Asian Studies, P.O. Box 9515, 2300 RA  
Leiden. 

The book contains the following parts: 
I: Introducing Board Games; II: Descriptive Research and Board Games; III: 
Archaeology and Board Games; IV: Sanskrit Studies and Board Games; V: Computer 
Science and Board Games; VI: Philosophy and Board Games. 

The articles in part IV are "The literary sources of Indian Chess and related 
board games" by Andreas Bock-Raming, and "Antiquity of Indian Board Games - a 
new approach" by C. Panduranga Bhatta. Unfortunately, the editor did not care 
to get all diacritics of Sanskrit words right.
