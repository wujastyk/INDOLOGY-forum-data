*TANTRA AND DHARMA TEACHERS FROM KASHMIR IN NEPAL -- The oldest manuscript
of the KRtyakalpataru*, by Michael Witzel

ABSTRACT
An early Devanagari MS of the 12th century work KRtyakalpataru that was
found in Nepal includes notes in early Sharada and Newari scripts which
indicate its use in India and in Nepal by a Kashmiri Pandit. As other
sources indicate, extensive travel of this type was not unusual, and this
helps to account for the close relation between Kashmiri and Nepalese
Tantra texts. Such long distance cultural relationships spanning the
subcontinent are in need of detailed study. Evidence from MSS such as the
present one, though usually neglected by scholars, provide important
materials for this endeavor.
