Subject: Shiva Sahasranama
Message-ID: <161227026548.23782.3505379840624111854.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I am interested in authoritative commentaries on the Shiva Sahasranama
from the Mahabharata.  I have heard of one by Niilaka.n.tha.  What
is the time frame of this bhaasyam?  Are any books available with the
original text?  Are there other bhaasyam-s on this subject?

Thanks for any help you can provide.
