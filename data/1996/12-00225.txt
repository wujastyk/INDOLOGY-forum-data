borderlands), European languages would show substratum influences, to
which we can attribute the common features of European IE languages.
Surely, European scholars are not averse in principle to
substratum influence in their own languages.

in this manner, the rest of Thomson's arguments can be countered 
by arguing that Dravidians migrated from near the Vindhyas to further
north during the third millenium BCE.
