Those of you who has voted and got "invalid", pls vote again. We need to
keep the Kashmir discussion within the Indian context given that Kashmir has
a long tradition of Vedic studies etc.

If this is correct, there is no need for you to reply. If your vote is
registered incorrectly then please vote again so we can fix it.
If this is a duplicate message, it's OK.  The Vote Taker is probably just
recounting the votes to make sure all is well.  No action is required on
your part.  Your vote will only be counted once.
You may change your vote by voting again.  This is a public vote, and
all addresses and votes will be listed in the final voting results.
To erase your vote and eliminate your address and vote from the final
