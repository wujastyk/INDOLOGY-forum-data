Deshmukh verse
Earlier today <CVEDGC at Levels.UniSA.Edu.Au> quoted a verse attributed to
C.D. Deshmukh:
RuNakartA pitA Stru na tu mantri param tatha
RuNam duhkhAya putrNam raStrANam tu hitAya cha.
A proper transcription of the verse would be as follows:
RuNakartA pitA Satrur (otherwise the first quarter would be short by one
syllable). 
na tu mantrI para.m tathA /
RuNa.m du.hkhAya putrANA.m
rA.StrANa.m tu hitAya cha //
Or, in the transcription I prefer: 
.r.nakartaa pitaa ;satrur 
na tu mantrii para.m tathaa /
.r.na.m du.hkhaaya putraa.naam
raa.s.trasya tu hitaaya ca //
Deshmukh was good at versification and was very well prepared in Sanskrit
grammar and literature. However, he was not a remarkable poet. One of his
better verses, written about the Buddha, may interest the members of this
list (especially the ones who wish to learn the aorist or the third past
tense):
svaya.m prabuddho jagatiim abuubudhat
svaya.m prakaa;so bhuvanaany adiidipat /
svaya.m ca nirvaa.nam upetya janmana.h
sa.msaara-bandhaat sva-janaan amuumucat //
In the verse quoted by <CVEDGC at Levels.UniSA.Edu.Au>, a better author would
have avoided the redundant use of tu and param and used tat in the place of
the very last word cha/ca. 
A Sanskrit poetician would not have considered the verse poetic, but, if
pressed, would have said that the second quarter should be something like:
naartha-mantrii (minister of finance) tu taad.r;sa.h. 
Good wishes.
