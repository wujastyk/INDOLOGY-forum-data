kala, anadi ananta, fellowship to India
Hi!
What is Indian Counsil for Philosophical Researc? It wasn't listed in the
information aboat "List of Universities adn other Institutions of Higher
Learning" given by Indian Council for Cultural Relations which gave me the
fellowship. Do Indian Council for Philosophical Research give lessons, or is
it just a place where a guy like me can get a single consultation?
It would be important for me to know, since I still have the possibility to
influence on my position regarding the fellowship.  
If you also have information aboat fax and tlf, please let me know.
