Kay and Robert will speak on the famous ruins of Angkor, the temples of
Ancient Cambodia.  During the last years of the eighth century, King
Jayavarman II liberated and unified his country, thus founding the first
dynasty of Angkor.  His successors built an incomparable series of
decorative temples in the region now known as Siemreap.  The
architecturally rich structures, some over one thousand years old, testify
to the pomp and genius of the King of Angkor and the deep spirituality of
the people.
