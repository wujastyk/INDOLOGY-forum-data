In this context, one should not forget classical debating
traditions in languages other than Sanskrit.  Even in 
Bombay, where I grew up, the "Bambaai Tamizh Sangham"
used to regularly organize so-called "pattimanRam"s,
in which various literary topics would be debated in 
very formal Tamil.  The hall used to be packed.  
Probably it's even more active in Tamil Nadu.  

Perhaps someone like Mr. Ganesan could cast more light 
on this.

Narayan Sriranga Raja.
