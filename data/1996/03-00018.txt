What will happen to those of us without "academic credentials" who neither
spam nor annoy the list members?  I read this and several other academic
lists in order to keep abreast of the fields and the current discourse.  I
don't contribute or ask questions, as I'm not really qualified, but I enjoy
and I learn.  In a way, I think that educated amateurs like me may be a
valuable link, although a quiet one, to the rest of the world.  I would miss
greatly your conversation if I were to be excluded.
