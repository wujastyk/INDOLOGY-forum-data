Khajuraho oops! Indology

I get the feeling that you are somewhat
apologetic/defensive about the "sexy"
sculptures at Khajuraho (they are, in
fact, quite sexy -- at least some of them).
As you probably agree, most Hindus (incl.
me, and probably you) are completely
clueless as to what these figures stand
for, and enjoy them on their own terms,
i.e., as "sexy" sculptures.  So what?
Possibly our ancestors were more elevated,
but somehow I doubt it.
I don't see any particular need to bring
in the "noblest of human values" (whatever
they might be) to explain away these sculptures.
Not that sexy sculptures are ignoble, of course.  
Cool it, dude.  No need to be prudish.  Such
sculptures, on a smaller scale, are found in
many other ancient Hindu temples.  No problem,
we like them.
All the best,
Narayan Sriranga Raja.
