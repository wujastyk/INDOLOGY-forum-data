Dear list members,

        In a recent book (Ariel Glucklich, _The Sense of Adharma_, New York,
OUP: 1994) we are told that the communities (grAma) known from Vedic
literature were usually surrounded by a fence. We don't know how these
fences looked like except for what can be guessed from later stone rails
(around stupa complexes for instance). What do we know about such fenced
villages from post-Vedic and medieval evidence? Is there a good historical
description of the topography of Indian villages?

Best regards to all,
