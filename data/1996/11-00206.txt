Subject: On Bindi, Tikka or Tilak

A few years ago Dr. Priyabala Shah wrote a book on Tilak. The book traces 
the origin and the meaning of tilak. You might find the answer you are 
looking for. The book was published from Ahmedabad and the title of the 
book is Tilak. I am afraid I don't remember the name of the publisher.
But she could be contacted at 12 Sadma Society, Ahamedabad.
