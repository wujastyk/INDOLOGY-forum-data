Why not a definitive devnagri font

Whatever may be the situation on the market - the Internet is supposed to
be a platform open to users of all sorts of systems (nobody mentioned OS/2
as yet, or those people who still stick to their old DOS-software), and
because, theoretically speaking, somewhere out there there might be users
who employ their own individual operating system, it's nonsense to step up
from a lowest common denominator-solution to one which would only apply to
Mac or Windows-users. Hence, I would strongly suggest that, until the
current lcd is replaced by one which allows for Devanagari, let's stick to
the present conventions.
