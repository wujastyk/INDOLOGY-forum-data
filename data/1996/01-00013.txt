Screen Fonts?
Question: Why do the screen fonts designed for Sanskrit transliteration 
look so unfinished in Windows programs?
I've downloaded two fonts: Dominic's CS Bitstream Charter and Jamie 
Hubbard's Sanskrit Times New Roman GE.  I've also tried Linguist's 
Software's TransIndic LS.  All true type for Windows, in Word Perfect 
6.1, also tried in WinWord 6.0.  All of them print nicely, but look very 
uneven on screen, with some letters fatter than others, etc.  Am I doing 
something wrong?  Any advice appreciated.
Thanks and Happy New Year to all!
