Khajuraho oops! Indology
I'm one of those indologically non-qualified persons, but I'd like to 
nudge along the discussion on Khajuraho. It's 
always struck me that there is a big difference between the 
artistically highly polished portrayals of what seems like 
ritual, "consecrated" sex on the main panels of the upper walls of the 
temple, and the crude representations of oral sex, bestial sex and so 
on along the lower foundation walls. Isn't this intended to 
distiguish divinely dedicated sex (practiced by kings and priests) 
from sex for the satisfaction of animal lusts (practiced by the "ignorant 
masses")? I know there's an enormous literature, and everything 
has probably already been said twenty times, but are there any further 
comments in this direction?
Now about the Indology List. It's a bit like Khajuraho - sublimely 
elevated professional indologists up there simultaneously spouting 
sanskrit slokas and penning transatlantic barbs to one another, down 
here the ignorant unqualified, shooting off unoriginal comments 
often without regard for common decency. Well, no, it's not 
that bad, and any other way it might lose a lot of the spontaneity it 
has. Perhaps a bit cocktail-party like - lots of rubbish and the 
occasional nugget - but one man's nugget is another man's rubbish.
Make it a closed list to keep out the spamming. Be tough with 
insulting contributions. Try to ignore the cranks. And, those of you 
who know it all anyway, just smile patiently and press "delete".
Dominik, the work you do is really worthwhile and very much 
appreciated by many people who never say so.
