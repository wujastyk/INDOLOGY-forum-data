Dear Anshuman,

The notations in Samaveda (123...) are as you assumed a notation system
intended for accentuating syllables during chanting. The other Vedas use
Svaras ( ' and _ ) above and below letters for intonation. ' means that
the voice is lifted on the vowel connected with the akshara, while _ means
that the voice is lowered on the same. In a similar way, Samaveda, which
is sung rather than recited uses numbers 1 to 3 to indicate its melody.
Unfortunately I am not aware, how exactly these are translated into
sound.
