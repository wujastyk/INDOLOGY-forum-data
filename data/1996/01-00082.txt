Sri Boovalaya...
Hello Everyone,
I am looking for references on a work called Sri Boovalaya (Siri
Boovalaya?). This is actually a Kannada work of a Jaina Munia, written
between the 1st and 10th century A.D.
Apparently this worl has great implications on languages, as it is supposed
to contain in coded form over 700 languages!
If anyone has information onthis pls end me an email.
Thanks & Regards...Devadas
