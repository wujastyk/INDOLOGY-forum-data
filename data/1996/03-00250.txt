Would someone please tell me where to find the actual location of 
the phrase from Max Muller: "He who knows one religion knows none." 
This has become a mantram in religious studies but I don't know 
where Muller actually said it.

With thanks

Noel Salmond

P.S. Does anyone know the source of the retort: "He who knows too 
many doesn't know any"?
