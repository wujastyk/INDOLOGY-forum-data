Abstracts on INDOLOGY
I heartily concur with Jonathan's suggestion, and I would like to offer
the INDOLOGY web site as a host for such a service.  The only proviso is
that I do not have the resources to do the actual work of compiling,
editing, and maintining such a resource myself.  So if someone wishes to
take on the work, I can provide the locus.   I think INDOLOGY would be a
very appropriate site for such an ongoing "current awareness" service.
