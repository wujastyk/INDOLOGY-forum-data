I had the same experience (100 K of empty returns, aargghh!), and I feel
the same aboout the compewter-geeks' attitude! Its like refusing to admit
that people speaking a foreignm language might have something useful to
say, so shout louder in your own language, til those idiots deign to answer
you in English (or French, or Hindi, or Gothenburg dialect or whatever).

Good some people speak up against supercilious oppression!

"Peace is not simply the absence of war.
It is not a passive state of being.
We must wage peace, as vigilantly as we wage war."
(XIV Dalai Lama)

"A coincidence, as we say in Middle-Earth"
