While the "Good Times" virus itself is a
hoax, the concept is feasible -- it can 
happen right now.

This is because of the increasing use of
MIME-capable email readers, which automatically
popup a viewer program when you read an email
that has MIME attachments.  For example, if
your email program (MIME-capable) is configured
to automatically popup Microsoft Word when it
sees an email attachment in MS Word format,
and if that MS Word document has a "Macro" virus
(see 
http://www.microsoft.com/msoffice/freestuf/msword/download/mvtool/mvtool2.htm
for more info), you could end up automatically
executing a virus on your Mac or PC, simply by
reading your email.

Similar horrors are, of course, theoretically 
possible by executing a PostScript or Acrobat "program"
by automatically launching your PS or Acrobat
viewer program from your email reader.

As for "Java" attachments, the mind boggles.   :-)

Raja.
