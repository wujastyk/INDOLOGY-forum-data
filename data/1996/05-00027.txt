Dear Indologists,

	I am writingh on behalf of a colleague who is not on this list.
The Photographic collection of the Warburg Institute - an iconographic
index of Western art, which is at the moment expanding towards the East -
has recently inherited a collection of excellent photographs of the
Bharhut stupa. In order to identify the subject of the sculptures we are
looking for expert advice on a reliable book.  Can anyone suggest a good 
title? 

	You can either reply to the list or directly to my colleague (Paul
Taylor (ptaylor at sas.ac.uk).

		With many thanks in advance.
