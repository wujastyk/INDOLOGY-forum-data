We bengalis have a beautiful method. We always had the debate of the 
solar and the lunar calendar.Akbar (though he was very unpopular and 
could not get a strong foothold) started bengali calendar in 
concordance with the Muslim Hiri calendar, but he made some sort of a 
compromise with all the hindu pundits(in favour of Solar) and Muslim 
ulemas(in favour of lunar ) and invented this BEngali calendar which 
has both the elements , very interestingly it goes along with the 
English calendar, we have bothe solar and lunar phases in our calendar.
