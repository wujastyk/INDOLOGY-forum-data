**From the Editorial**
Here I wish to draw particular attention to three contributions, all of which say something new and important, making real additions to our knowledge of Buddhism. I think that any reader can see for themselves that ?The Silent Mentors of Tzu Chi? is a remarkable article. It is remarkable firstly in being both a primary and a secondary source... the whole is further enhanced by the comments of the author, himself a prominent member of Tzu Chi. Rey?s article is uplifting. That by Suren R?ghavan is deeply depressing. Here we overlap with journalism ? and Suren has indeed worked as a journalist ? for he is recording the activities of a new movement which 3 months ago, when he started writing, hardly anyone outside Sri Lanka had heard of, while now more news, much of it lurid, is appearing on the Internet every day. But his article is far from ephemeral. He adds to his report of ongoing events a profound analysis of their background and current context, leading to a chilling warning of where they seem to be heading. The article by Brett Shults could hardly be more different, for it deals in painstaking detail with facts which have been available for over two thousand years ? but not adequately understood.
