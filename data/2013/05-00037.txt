Subject: [INDOLOGY] Unicode Devanagari font that functions in InDesign?
Message-ID: <0BE2894C-56EB-4C84-A2BD-2328EE98C597@columbia.edu>

Dear members of the list,

   Does anyone know of a Unicode Devan?gar? font that functions under Adobe's InDesign?  I have been unable to locate one either for free or for sale.

   All of the available Unicode Devan?gar? fonts that I have found and attempted to use (Devanagari Sangam, e-Nagari, Devanagari MT, JanaHindi, Nakula, Sahadeva, Sakal Bharati, etc.) break up conjuncts and misplace preceding vowels in documents under InDesign.

   Any recommendations would be appreciated.

Thank you,
