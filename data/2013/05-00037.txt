[INDOLOGY] Unicode Devanagari font that functions in InDesign?
Dear members of the list,
   Does anyone know of a Unicode Devan?gar? font that functions under Adobe's InDesign?  I have been unable to locate one either for free or for sale.
   All of the available Unicode Devan?gar? fonts that I have found and attempted to use (Devanagari Sangam, e-Nagari, Devanagari MT, JanaHindi, Nakula, Sahadeva, Sakal Bharati, etc.) break up conjuncts and misplace preceding vowels in documents under InDesign.
   Any recommendations would be appreciated.
Thank you,
