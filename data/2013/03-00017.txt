[INDOLOGY] Query
Now that I know the context better, may I suggest that deva-var.sa may mean 'royal reign year.' deva is commonly used in addressing a ruler/king. One would expect documents to be dated in terms governments and local legal institutions would understand. Various inscriptions are so commonly dated in terms of regnal years.

Thanks to Ashok and Suresh for their thoughts. Unfortunately, this refers to a document where the year in which it is executed has to be written down. So a day of the gods (according to the yoga theory) or rain does not fit the bill. I thought of something like the Jupiter Cycle of 60 years, each of which has a specific name, but devavar?a is not one of them!!
