Geschichte der Germanistik
?Dear colleagues,
The journal Geschichte der Germanistik, which now bears the subtitle
"Historische Zeitschrift f?r die Philologien," aims to publish a yearly
bibliography for a variety of traditions, including South Asian.
Information about books and articles that deal with South Asian philology
broadly conceived (and including Fachgeschichte) should be sent to
?me, ?
