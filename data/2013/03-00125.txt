[INDOLOGY] Site coordinates (again)
Dear Fran?ois,
Greg Possehl prepared in 1986 an unpublished index entitled
Indian Archaeology, A Review: Guide to excavated sites 1953-54
through 1983-84. My copy of this index is (together with the
IAR volumes) in the Helsinki University Library.
Best regards, Asko
