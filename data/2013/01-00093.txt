Thank you Robert for this valuable information. Perhaps you could explain a bit about the type and quality of evidence we have pointing to the correct state of the mulapatha and the corrupted state of the pracalitapatha.
Many thanks,
Howard Resnick

These two traditions are linked with caste distinctions within the M?dhva community: the m?lap??ha with the original Taulava M?dhvas (Madhva himself was a Taulava) and the pracalitap??ha with the De?astha M?dhvas (Jayat?rtha was a De?astha).

The best edition of Madhva's collected writings, by Banna?je Govind?c?rya, is based on the m?lap??ha (mainly on a manuscript by H??ike?at?rtha, a direct disciple of Madhva), which was printed some time in the 1970s, if I recall correctly. Govind?c?rya is at present working on a new edition of the Mah?bh?ratat?tparyanir?aya together with a new commentary (by himself) in Sanskrit.
