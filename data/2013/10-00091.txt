Dear Vitus,

Perhaps it is related to a "ni?yandaja" (trickle-born) type of water described in the p?nabhoga section of the M?nasoll?sa of Some?vara: (verse 1609 in vol. 2, p137)

v?luk?su karair garta? k?tv? yat pr?pyate jalam |
utk?epa?ena nairmalya? y?ti ni?yandaja? hi tat ||

this water seems to be created by digging a hole in the sandy banks of the river, and letting it fill up with (river) water. The water moving up (utk?epa?a) through the sand gives it filtration (nairmalyam).

so perhaps the "vik?rya" in your sentence corresponds to this utk?epa?a. I'm not terribly convinced by my own explanation, however.

Best wishes,

Adheesh
