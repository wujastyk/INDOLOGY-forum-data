Open Access publishing
The NIH in the US has something similar, but with a specific difference.
As far as I understand, all research they fund can be published in the
various journals, but some time thereafter is also posted, in a slightly
different format, in the NIH public access system.
"The *NIH Public Access Policy
<http://publicaccess.nih.gov/policy.htm>*ensures that the public has
access to the published results of NIH funded
research. It requires scientists to submit final peer-reviewed journal
manuscripts that arise from NIH funds to the digital archive PubMed
Central<http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/>
*upon acceptance for publication*.  To help advance science and improve
human health, the Policy requires that these papers are accessible to the
public on PubMed Central no later than 12 months after publication."
