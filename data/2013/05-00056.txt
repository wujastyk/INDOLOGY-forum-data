[INDOLOGY] Dutch Studies on South Asia,	Tibet and Classical Southeast Asia
Dear Colleagues,
This may be an opportune moment to draw attention to the online
bibliography on Dutch Studies on South Asia, Tibet and Classical
Southeast Asia which has recently gone online:
http://dutchstudies-satsea.nl/home-dutch-studies.html
The website has been prepared by Dory Heilijgers, former librarian of
the Kern Institute. It is actively maintained by her and continues to
expand.
