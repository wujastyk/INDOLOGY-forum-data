ICPBS website
  Dear Prof. Dr. Walter Slaje,
Our College has just launched a new website named ICPBS Digital
Collections. You can find back issues of the Journal of the ICPBS,
Concordances to the Buddhist Canon (2 items), Itokura, and the latest
version 1.3 of the Bibliographical Sources for Buddhist Studies. Doctoral
dissertations will be opened at this site in the future.
We will be very happy if you would kindly inform your students on our new
website.
Address of the website: https://icabs.repo.nii.ac.jp/
Your kind attention will be highly appreciated.
Sincerely Yours,
Yasuhiro Sueki
