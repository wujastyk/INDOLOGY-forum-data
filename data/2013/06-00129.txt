[INDOLOGY] question for European Indologists
A propos Elisa's comment on Stenzler, for the sake of completeness it should be pointed out that there is an English translation of his "Primer of the Sanskrit Language", made by Renate Sohnen-Thieme and published by the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London (1st edn 1992, 2nd revised edn 1997). It was used in elementary Sanskrit classes at SOAS at least while Dr Sohnen-Thieme was teaching them. The preface to the second edition mentions (p. vi) that "The English edition published in 1992 has been warmly welcomed in various parts of the world."
All the best,

Re: [INDOLOGY] question for European Indologists
Perhaps a general answer seems to emerge: there is nothing like a uniform European answer.?
A few further points:
&#8212;Stenzler's Grammar has never been used, as far as I know, outside the German-speaking countries
&#8212;Many have used (both as students and as teachers) Coulson's Teach Yourself Sanskrit, possibly integrating it with Whitney and Speijer's Sanskrit Syntax
&#8212;In my personal experience, I used (both as a student and as a teacher) Ashok Aklujkar's An Easy Introduction to an Enchanting Language
&#8212;If you want to have a deeper glance of the issue, you might want to get in touch with Prof. Iwona Milewska, who is &#8212;among many other qualities&#8212; also a refined scholar of the history of the didactic of Sanskrit (I might send you her address in case you need it)
Best wishes for your research!
