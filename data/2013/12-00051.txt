It is, nevetheless, interesting to see Vaishnavas writing at roughly the
same time as Vijnanabhiksu, Sanatana Goswami for instance, in his Brhad
Bhagavatamrta, presenting a path in which those who we would classify as
Hindus today find a place in the progression towards Krishna, and others --
Buddhists, Jains, what to say of Muslims -- do not. Do we see such schemes
before the 16th century? If not, the question is, what has changed to allow
for such a paradigm.

Kind regards
Aleksandar
