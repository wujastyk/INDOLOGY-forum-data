[INDOLOGY] "vIraka"
If I understand Judit correctly, the Nandirudra which Jayaratha writes of
is not half-bull half-man. Identification of Nandin as ?iva's bull is a
recent phenomenon; in the pre-modern period, the bull vehicle was just
called V??abha while Nandin/Nandirudra was a ga?a and one of ?iva's
dv?rap?las.
