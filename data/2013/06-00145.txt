This is also an abbreviation used by Cappeller in his Sanskrit-German dictionary and a constant source of fun.
On a different anecdotic level, a student who had to translate a sentence into German (from Perry's primer, I guess) got it altogether wrong. The student rendered: ??strasya kartre p??inaye nama? with "die Wissenschaft des Handelnden ist die Ehre seiner H?nde" (roughly, "the science of the acting person is the honour of his hands").
All the best
