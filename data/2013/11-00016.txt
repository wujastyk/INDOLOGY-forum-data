[INDOLOGY] Identifying deities
As Michael rightly says, these are Siva and Parvati with Kamadhenu. However, as far as I know as a Sri Lankan, there is no direct relation of Siva and Parvati to Kiriamma cult. 'The cult of the goddess Pattini' by Gananath Obeyesekere may provide details.

[INDOLOGY] Identifying deities
I was hoping that someone could help me identify the deities in the attached document. I believe that they are associated with the Kiri Amma cult in Sri Lanka which is in turn associated with Pattini. How this relates to the actual image I'm not sure. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
