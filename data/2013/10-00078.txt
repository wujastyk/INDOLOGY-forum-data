Dear Arlo:
Indeed, I transcribed the text wrong -- your reading is correct. Dharmaja appears to be a kind of "ordeal" or oath to determine the guilt or innocence of a litigant. This is because the verdict is born out of dharma -- the judge writes "dharma" on one leaf and "adharma" on another, and the man has to pick one of them. If he picks "dharma" he is innocent!! Best,
Patrick
