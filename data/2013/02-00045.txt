Subject: [INDOLOGY] First use of 'Indology'

The English Wikipedia entry <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indology> (15 Feb
2013) points out the early German and Dutch usage of the term, but doesn't
give dates.   The German Wikipedia
entry<http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indologie>is more detailed, but
doesn't track the history of the term itself.

The OED traces the word only to 1888:

  /?n?d?l?d??/
 *Etymology:*  < Indo- comb.

 + -logy comb. form <http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/109868#eid39107762>.

  The study of Indian history, literature, philosophy, etc.
1888   *Tr?bner's Monthly List* Oct. 134   There is not a single branch of
Indology?with, perhaps, the single exception of Vedic studies?which will
not gain very considerably by its publication.
1895   *Atlantic Monthly* Mar. 399.
 but notes that this entry was published in 1900 and hasn't been fully
updated.

I don't think anyone today calls themselves an "Indologian."  The OED entry
for "Indologist" cites only from 1904:
Indologist, n.
