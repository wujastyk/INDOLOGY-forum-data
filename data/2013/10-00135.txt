Dear colleagues,

We have reached the solutions bellow:

Lars Fosse: [mleccho ha v? e?a][yad apa?abda?],  "this one is indeed a mleccha because [yad = yasm?t] he is one whose speech is ungrammatical [apa?abdah being a bahuvr?hi of the masculine idea in e?a?]?

D. Wujastyk through N?ge?a: "a bad word [apa?abda?] is really despicable [mleccha?]", probably here also yad for yasm?t (? because a bad word??);

Hans Hoch opts for the invariable yad-construction (= namely, viz.), also referred to by MW in his yad-entry: " that is to say " , " to wit " e.g. ??? ???? ??? ????? ??????? ??? ??? , " the gods then saw this thunderbolt , to wit , the water ?. Hoch gave: ?That indeed is barbarous [taking mleccha as adjective], namely/viz. incorrect speech.? 

Also G. Cardona e D. Bhattacarya understand the yad for an adverbial yad (= yasm?d, ? because?). The gloss in S?ktiratn?kara quoted by Cardona being ?yad yasm?d apa?abdo mleccho, mlecchatay?tiprasiddha ity artha??.

So the adverbial yad seems to have been preferred by most.

Still I ask if anyone doesn?t feel the position of the yad to be awkward in this passage. Would it be accounted for just by the wider freedom of sanskrit word order or by some decorum in imitating the Vedic style. Also of note, in the MW example ?if he is wright?, we have the same awkward position. 

Thanks a lot to all for the immense help.

This may make it possible to interpret the passage mleccho ha vai eSo yad apazabdaH as an instance of what I have termed the "invariable yad-construction" (see the grammatical notes in my UpaniSadic Reader); so the translation would be something like this 'That indeed is barbarous [taking mleccha as adjective], namely/viz. incorrect speech.'

One might think, N?ge?a said, that the word mleccha would usually refer to a person or a place; how could it refer to a bad word?  But in this case it is a term of criticism.
