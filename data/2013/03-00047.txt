[INDOLOGY] Linux in a virtual box on Mac (was: Fwd: New Sanskrit-Eng. dictionary...)
Hi Robert,
Which version of Lion do you have?  Since I haven't used Lion in a while, I looked around a bit.  Apparently, the 10.7.4 or 10.7.5 update is what solved the problem.  I definitely don't have this problem in Mountain Lion.

Feel free to write me off-list since our discussion is probably moving too far afield for everyone else.
Best,
Steven

Our university gave us new computers a few months ago with 'Lion' on it
RestoreMeNot, but that doesn't work either...
Maybe this is improved in Mountain Lion? Or I'm just having very bad
luck? I don't know.
