[INDOLOGY] Devanagari keyboard
I'm inclined to agree, Dominik, even though I've become well-used to the
"Devanagari-QWERTY" keyboard and don't really notice its inefficiencies. In
any case, it was an oasis of relative sense in the otherwise awfully mired
world of Devanagari input several years ago, where Windows input methods
were particularly confounding. Google's Input Tools (which Charles DiSimone
posted to this thread) have a Sanskrit component which works in a manner
very much like you describe your Ubuntu experience. It seems quite nice.
They also come in an offline-Windows version. I'm curious if there is
something similarly accessible for us Mac users.
