[INDOLOGY] Milk ocean
Using Harvard Kyoto transliteration:? kSIra can mean milk, milky sap, water or a milk dish. The Hindi word KhIr for rice pudding comes from this word.

Re: [INDOLOGY] Milk ocean
I believe khir is Skt kshira (I haven't figured out how to do diacriticals on Indology yet).
Other examples of Bengali simplifying Sanskrit consonant clusters, specifically?ksh to kh:
Parikshit -- Parikhit
Kshetra -- Khetra
Bengali also sometimes simplifies Skt consonant clusters by adding a vowel: ?bhakta -- bhakata
