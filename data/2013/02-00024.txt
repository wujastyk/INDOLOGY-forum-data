Query
Dear All:
I wonder whether anyone has encountered the term "praj?ra?i" -- which, as far as I can tell, consists of praj? + ara?i, the latter in the send of mother, a recorded meaning. I find this in the Sm?ticandrik? (Mysore ed., Sa?sk?ra, p. 31). The best I can do is to take it to mean some sort of a surrogate mother. This is in the context of kaliyugavarjya, and the verse runs:
praj?rtha? tu dvij?gry???? praj?ra?iparigraha?.
Thanks.
Patrick
