[INDOLOGY] query: 18 ;sre.nii jaatis
Dear Patrick,
     In continuation of Ashok's suggestion, I want to point out that there
is an expression in Marathi ???? ??? ???? "18 types of J?tis".  Some of the
J?tinir?aya texts produced by Marathi Pandits may have some local listings
similar to what Ashok has given.  I have one or two such texts, and will
check if they have any list of 18 J?tis.
