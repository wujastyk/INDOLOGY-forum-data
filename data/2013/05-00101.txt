[INDOLOGY] debt
Jonathan:
Debt (???d?na) is the first of the so-called Title of Law (vyavah?rapada) -- found in Kau?ilya's Artha??stra and Manu -- this is taken as the standard (prak?ti) legal dispute, and it is within this subject that most early authors (Manu, Y?j?avalkya) present legal procedure (evidence etc.). So debt was a BIG DEAL in Indian thought, and it is from this that the theology of innate debts (Taittir?ya Sa?hit? etc.) arose. But I do not see anywhere a concept of forgiving debts -- such as Jubilee. The only comparable thing is the rule that the interest cannot be reach a level more than the original sum: thus what is ever payable is double what was borrowed. Once the interest reaches that level, the principal ceases to accrue interest. There are ways around this, but that is a whole other story.
Best,
Patrick
