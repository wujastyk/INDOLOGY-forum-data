[INDOLOGY] Pada and Charan
Dear Harsha, perhaps because both the poet and the bhakta beat their  
foot on the ground to give themselves the rhythm (this 'beating' is  
the ictus in the Latin metrics, and of course pada is the same of  
Latin pes, pedis). Love, Daniela
Friends~
The word pada and charan is used both for feet as well as a devotional  
verse.
Is there any reason for this?
Kind regards.
