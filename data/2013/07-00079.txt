[INDOLOGY] Indology in Bologna 1900-1903 AD (and Paul-Emile	Dumont)
Dear Klaus,
I cannot be 100% sure of course, but I think that source might be incorrect. 
According to several other sources, including the original files from the Senate of Italy linked below (Pull? was also a senator of the Kingdom of Italy), Pull? was first "Full professor of Sanskrit and Comparative history of the classical languages" in Padua from June 3rd 1886 to 1889; then "Full professor of Sanskrit" in Pisa only for a few months, starting June 20th 1889; and eventually "Full professor of Indo-European Philology" in Bologna from October 23rd 1899 to 1925.
In fact, he established the "Gabinetto di Glottologia Sperimentale" (later renamed "Istituto di Glottologia", then "Dipartimento di Studi Linguistici e Orientali" and currently "Dipartimento di Storia, Culture e Civilt?") in Bologna already in 1902.
