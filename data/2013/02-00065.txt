[INDOLOGY] First use of 'Indology'
Dear Suresh
In his Zend-Avesta (1771), Anquetil commented on the inadequate methods used to study Indian religions. He invites his reader to consider how imperfect a knowledge of the Christian religion a ?Tartar? would gain if, ?travelling in the less instructed Christian kingdoms, he should content himself with entering churches, and questioning the sexton or porter of a Portuguese convent. And yet this is the limit of the researches of the majority of travellers in India. They are happy if they take nothing but the simple testimony of a Dobachi, of a Pion, who... explains to them, in bad Portuguese, the mysteries which he hardly knows, and which his priests would not be able to render without difficulty in the language of the country.? He proposed instead a "travelling academy" of professional scholars, which is perhaps a precursor to what Mill suggests, although it owes more to the model of the royal academies in early modern France, or Solomon's House in Bacon's New Atlantis.  
I discuss his proposal briefly in Mapping Hinduism (pp. 142-47). 
Best
Will
