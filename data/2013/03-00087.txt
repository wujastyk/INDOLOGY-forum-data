Subject: [INDOLOGY] Nagararjuna finger pointing to moon reference?

Dear Dean,

Yes, that is one of the passages from the Dazhidu lun I indicated (the title has been back-translated as mahaprajnaparamita-sastra), so this is from the Chinese. This is the one that contains the expression ??? zhi zhi yue "finger pointing at the moon" twice.

Here, in case you are interested, is the Chinese text:

???????9?1 ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????(T25.1509.125a29-b5)


So this is from the Dazhidu lun ????, fascicle 9, "Introduction", found at Taisho volume 25, text # 1509, p. 125, line 29 of the top register, continuing to line 5 of the middle register. A Taisho page has three registers per page.

I don't think there is a consensus on Nagarjuna's authorship -- some argue it is authentic because translated by Kumarajiva, but I am in the camp that questions the attribution. The more likely scenario is that because Nagarjuna becomes associated with the Prajnaparamita corpus (legend holds he retrieved it from the Naga king at the sea bottom, a "hidden" scripture containing the Buddha's words awaiting the right time and person to be "revealed" since its Mahayanic message was ahead of its time), that association led someone to pseudepigraphically attributing the Dazhidu lun to him. Some have speculated that it may have been authored by Kumarajiva himself.

As with much of the Nagarjuna literature, it remains an open question. In recent times some scholars have even begun to question whether the Vigraha-vyavartani -- hitherto considered along with the Madhyamaka-karikas as the touchstone bone fides of authentic Nagarjuna writing -- may have not been written by him.

Two points: 

The madhyamika tradition in China, based on Kumarajiva's translations, was called Sanlun, "three treatises," those three being MMK, The 12 Gate Treatise, and the Dazhidulun. Anyone who has read the 12 Gate Treatise will immediately recognize its derivative nature and lack of intellectual spark -- so hardly anyone considers that an authentic Nagarjuna text. Hence Kumarajiva attributions are not bona fides.

9 out of 10 times when an East Asian traditional source cites or mentions Nagarjuna, what they mean is the Dazhidu lun. That text had wide popularity -- the other two lun-s are rarely if ever cited. So the East Asian sense of who and what Nagarjuna was, is quite different from what we in the West (or Tibet) have cultivated.

best,
Dan

  Thanks Dan! 

  Michael Dorfman also sent me this information below -- also from the Chinese, I guess.

  Is there scholarly consensus about whether Nagarjuna might actually have said it?

  Best,

  "Relying on the meaning (arthapratisara?a), since goodwill or malice, defect or merit, falsity or truth, cannot be attributed to meaning. It is the letter (vya?jana) that indicates the meaning (artha), but the meaning is not the letter. Suppose a man points his finger at the moon to people who doubt the moon's presence; if these doubters fixate on the finger but do not look at the moon, this man tells them: "I am pointing to the moon with my finger so that you may notice the moon. Why do you fixate on my finger instead of looking at the moon?"  It is the same here: the letter (vya?jana) is the finger pointing to the meaning (artha), but the letter is not the meaning. This is why one should not rely on the letter."

  Dear Dean,

  I don't know of any Sanskrit texts offhand that make that claim in Nagarjuna's name, but the Dazhidu lun (WG: Ta chih-tu lun), translated by Kum?raj?va into Chinese in the first decade of the fifth century which he attributes to Nagarjuna (it is considered a commentary on the Praj??p?ramit? s?tra), contains that line three times: Twice at T 25.1509.125a29-b5, and then once again at T.25.1509.726a2-3.

  Aside from Nagarjuna attributions, one also finds that line in all three Chinese trs. of the La?k?vat?ra s?tra:

  by Gu?abhadra (tr between 435-443 CE): T.16.670.510c17
  by Bodhiruci (513 CE): T.16.671.557a20
  by ?ik??nanda (ca. 700 CE): T.16.672.620a15

  It is also found in Gu?abhadra's tr. of the A?gulim?l?ya s?tra (tr between 435-443), T.2.20.537a11-12 (Yangjuemolo jing)

    Does anyone have the exact text reference for the statement attributed to Nagarjuna that one should look to the moon, not the finger pointing to the moon? In other words, the words of the teaching are not the same as their realization.

    Best,

    Dean
