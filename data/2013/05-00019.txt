This seems fairly universal (inflated exchange rates) ~ I experienced the 
same in Japan years ago.  The excuse used is that the value of various 
currencies fluctuate and that has to be protected and then there is the bank 
exchange commission tto add on.  Also note that businesses NEVER the 
official bank exchange rate nor tyhe tourist rate.

Best wishes,
