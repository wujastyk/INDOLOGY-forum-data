Dear Dr. Ganesan,


You raise a very good point.



My statement in the post below was made based on my understanding of what John Carman and Vasudha Narayanan had written in The Tamil Veda (University of Chicago Press: 1989). 


According to Carman and Narayanan, it is true that R?m?nuja (R) has not explicitly acknowledged Namm??v?r (N) in any of his works. But, the following indirectly point to R's reverence for N. (Page numbers refer to pages in The Tamil Veda.)


1. R's disciple, Amuta??r (A), the author of Ir?m?nuca N???ant?ti, refers to R's reverence for N (p.43).  
2. R acknowledged Yamuna (Y) to be his master and Y had adored N (p.54). (Y died before R reached him according to hagiography.)
3. R's disciples considered themselves part of a lineage that included R (p.54) and they adored N.
4. R wrote to convince a non-?r?vai??ava Brahmin audience and so only cited Sanskrit sources (p. 54). (If I understand Carman and Narayanan correctly, they seem to feel that even though R really revered N, considering the audience he was targeting, R did not cite N.)
5. The influence of N on R is seen in his discussions. For instance on p. 155, Carman and Narayanan
 write, "...Namma?v?r's own words express a theme that is equally prominent in the Sanskrit writings of R?m?nuja and is perhaps clearest where R?m?nuja is not simply commenting on a particular text but developing the meaning of the whole." 


However, I look forward to any updated information you may have regarding the historical accuracy of any of the points.  For instance, Ir?m?nuca N???ant?ti is a work praising R. Was its author A and was he indeed a direct disciple of R known from historical evidences other than hagiography? What would be the motivation for A to say R adored N, if A was indeed R's disciple? I would appreciate any new insights into these questions.


Thanks


Regards,
Palaniappan

For ?a?kara's              views on this issue, see

          R?m?nuja also essentially had the same opinion in his          commentary. See        
          
http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/sbe48/sbe48137.htm
          

            
          
On the                  other hand, what is interesting is that for                  ?r?vai??avas like R?m?nuja, the ??dra saint Namm??v?r                  was/is the foremost saint.
        
      
    
    Where is such a reference by Ramanuja to Namm??v?r        in his works ? Nowhere  does he make any such    reference. 
    It seems only much long after Ramanuja such ideas were incorporated    in the propagation of SriVaishnavism.
