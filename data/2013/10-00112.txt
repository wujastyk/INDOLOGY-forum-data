Dear list,
I have come across several references to R?m?nand?'s studying Yoga Upani?ad-s as key texts (Ramdas Lamb, for instance in his article on the R?m?nand?'s for Gerald Larson's festschrift).? So far I have been unable to confirm which Upani?ad-s they consider significant.
I would be very grateful to be pointed to more information, particularly? which faction(s) of the order and which of these texts specifically do they utilize. Any help would be most welcome.
Many Thanks,
