article request
Does any one have at hand an electronic copy of Rosane Rocher's chapter
entitled "Weaving Knowledge: Sir William Jones and Indian Pandits" in
Objects of Enquiry: the life, contributions, and influences of Sir William
Jones, 1746-1794, edited by Garland Cannon and Kevin R. Brine, pp. 51-82.
The copy at my local library is not accessible.
Thank you; the help is deeply appreciated.
