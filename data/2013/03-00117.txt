[INDOLOGY] Site coordinates (again)
Dear List,
Some time ago (March 21), I sent a query on the geographical coordinates (latitude-longitude, degrees or decimal, in WGS84 system) of the following archaeological sites:
Nindowari
Jhukar
Lohumjo-daro
Kayatha
I received no answer what so ever, and wonder if the message was received by anyone, so I send it again.
Thanks in advance,
