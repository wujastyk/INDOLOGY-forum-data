[INDOLOGY] Devanagari keyboard
Hi Matthew,
There is also an exact clone of the straightforward Mac OS X
"Devanagari-QWERTY" keyboard layout that I ported to Windows several years
ago. It's available for download at http://www.ubcsanskrit.ca/keyboards.html,
which also includes instructions and images for the layout.
?Regards?
