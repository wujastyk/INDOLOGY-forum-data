Friends~
We are organising a round table on Modernity and India on Wednesday July 3 at Carleton University in Ottawa, ON., Canada.
We are looking for a speaker who could talk about cultural, artistic or philosophic aspects of Modernity in India.
Do let me know if anyone is interested. The University will pay 2 nights hotel and airfare up to $500.
Kind regards.
HarshaProf. Harsha V. Dehejia
