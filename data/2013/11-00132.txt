All I have done is to give evidence that I think shows a fairly coherent belief system in Sangam literature that is consistent with what happens in villages today (or at least in villages 50 years ago).  For example, we find very clear descriptions of suttee, of widow asceticism, of a?a?ku being localized in the breasts in Sangam Literature.  Then we have the Cilappatik?ram in which a widow burns down Madurai by tearing off her breast.  And today we still have widow asceticism.  Until about a century ago, low-caste women were not allowed to wear blouses to cover their breasts. These seem to me to be linked by a system of belief.  The same is true with the communities found in Sangam Literature, I believe.  These are similar to castes ? whether one calls them castes or not is immaterial.  They were almost certainly endogamous; in fact, Trautmann?s Dravidian Kinship shows that cross-cousin marriage was the norm in all of the Deccan for millennia (a fact confirmed by Ku?untokai 40).  The poems, in my opinion, indicate that Dalits existed when they were written and that they served as intermediaries with the spirit world, which they continue to do today.  It is my opinion that village culture  and beliefs in much of South Asia have changed very slowly over the millennia
I have tried to give evidence for these views.  Many have disagreed, though I have not found any criticism that for me has been persuasive.  I would not at all mind being proved wrong, but in my analysis, the basic belief system in Tamil villages has persisted for at least two millennia.  It is up to other scholars to accept these views or reject them.  George
