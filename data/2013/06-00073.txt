[INDOLOGY] Pdfs of two Hara (Minoru) articles?
Dear colleagues,
The link I posted in an earlier email, as Hara's 1966 dissertation, was not
correct.  I posted a link to a later 2002 work that is still in copyright.
My sincere apologies to the publishers, the author, and everyone
concerned.  If you wish to read the 2002 work, please buy a physical copy from
the publishers<http://www.istb.univie.ac.at/cgi-bin/sdn/sdn.cgi?order_form=1>
!
Sincerely,
Dominik
