Dominik: 

Actually when you get used to it, it is quite fast and simple. In your case you have to use Shift in order to make conjunct, which also includes an extra keystroke. The reason for "f", I assume, is that Devan?gar? assumes the vowel "a" after a consonant, unless there is a vir?ma; and "f" has that function. So, if you really want a vir?ma -- you type the consonant and "f" and give a space.

It's the same whatever program I'm using,  because the keyboard/language stuff is handled by the operating system, not each individual program.  As far as I know, anyhow.  It's handled by software on my system, Ubuntu Linux, called Ibus and m17n (which comes with Devanagari and IAST romanization already pre-defined).
