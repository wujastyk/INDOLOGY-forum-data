Subject: [INDOLOGY] Devanagari keyboard
In-Reply-To: <CAJ8W4QSmPhhwvoUYtABzvUfpgnJ95_1XG2ZUZvR-mgVByKM+9Q@mail.gmail.com>

So, Tim, would it be fair to say that the general advice for Mac users
wanting to type Devanagari, and to maintain interoperability with doc
files, would be: move to Nisus Writer or LibreOffice?  (The latter is free,
of course, so it's easy to experiment.)
