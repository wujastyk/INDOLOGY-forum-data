I
? completely agree about the admiration for Speyer's book.  It's really
quite extraordinary.  Deeply laced throughout with Paninian references
(fully understood for their linguistic meaning) and showing a sensitive and
original flair for translation and understanding of his examples.  Amazing
book.
