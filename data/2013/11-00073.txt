[INDOLOGY] missing obituary notices: Bhikkhu Jinananda
With due respect to Matthew Kapstein's suggestion, I'd say Jinananda's supervisor 
was more likely to have been John Brough, who unlike Basham was a Pali (and 
Sanskrit) specialist. That's not to say it couldn't have been Basham, who had an 
extraordinary range of competence.
