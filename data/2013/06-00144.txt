[INDOLOGY] question for European Indologists
Although the question was addressed to European Sanskritists, on the popularity of Stenzler, let me add that a few generations of Chinese Indologists in Beijing all started with Prof. Ji Xianlin's Chinese translations of Stenzler. Students at Peking University even today know the textbook so well that they quote the grammatical points by number. The translation was revised and reprinted just a few years ago. Ji was trained in Goettingen.
