Subject: [INDOLOGY] New book announcement
Message-ID: <CAKdt-Ceytsyy1HPSMK2M6iLn3g-sCTiVprX2==fMXv6NcGjbkQ@mail.gmail.com>

I am pleased to announce the publication of

   - Dominik Wujastyk, Anthony Cerulli and Karin Preisendanz
(editors), *Medical
   Texts and Manuscripts in Indian Cultural History* (New Delhi: Manohar
   Publishers and Distributors, 2013).  ISBN-13: 978-9350980194.

The book includes papers by Cristina Pecchia, Philipp Maas, Kenneth Zysk,
Tsudomu Yamashita, Manoj Sankaranarayana and P. Ram Manohar, in addition to
chapters by each of the editors.  There is a preface and a subject index.

The book is listed by
Amazon.com,<http://www.amazon.com/Medical-Manuscripts-Indian-Cultural-History/dp/9350980193/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1375114355&sr=8-1&keywords=wujastyk+medical+texts>but
is currently unavailable.  Presumably the entry will go live in the
near future.  For Europeans, the book is available at
Amazon.de<http://www.amazon.de/Medical-Manuscripts-Indian-Cultural-History/dp/9350980193/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1375114465&sr=8-1&keywords=wujastyk+medical+manuscripts>,
but seems rather highly priced; perhaps it will come down once distribution
gets underway.  The publisher's website is here<http://www.manoharbooks.com/>
.

The authors have each retained the copyright of their own contributions to
this volume.
