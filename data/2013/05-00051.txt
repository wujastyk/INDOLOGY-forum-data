Not a bad question. Some others too indirectly related to Indology may
rise. ????? ??????????? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? 

Take-over of publishing companies has
been going on for many years. It first came to my notice when Mouton merged
into de Gruyter. Some collectors were gratified. ?Old copies of many books like Lingat?s Les
sources du droit...,Maximilien ?Rubel?s Karl Marx etc, publications under the series ?Le Monde d?Outre Mer...?
,?Janua Linguarum? ?etc were sold
extremely cheap. 
But
the occurrence of the phenomenon in the West has remained a mystery to me. Take-over
and liquidation take place in India too. Usually labor trouble is blamed. But
sometimes the role played by notorious takeover kings is clear. Also the
proverbial throwing out the refuse after squeezing the juice is often
indicated. But, according to my knowledge, there are strong laws against such malpractice
or abuse of law in the highly industrialized countries. Then why should an active
and apparently profitably running company lose its entity?

Was Forsten a bargain?
