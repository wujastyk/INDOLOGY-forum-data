[INDOLOGY] lexical query
Does anybody have a scan of the following?
Bergaigne, Abel, (1889) Recherches sur l'histoire de la liturgie ve?dique. La forme me?trique des hymnes du Rig-Ve?da.
I have checked archive.org and google books with no luck. I have also tried to get it through ILL, but am told that no one will lend it.
Thanks,
