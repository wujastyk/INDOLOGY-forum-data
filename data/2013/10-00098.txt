[INDOLOGY] Katyayana's Shrauta Sutra
Dear Colleagues
I want to thank Madhav Deshpande for sending a pdf of the Chowkambha
edition of Katyayana's Srauta Sutra.  Their text is however flawed, with
many  of the KS Sutras missing.
If anyone might have a scan of Ganesh Umakant Thite's 1900 edition that
would be most welcome.
Cheers
James
