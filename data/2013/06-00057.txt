Subject: [INDOLOGY] Pot making in ancient India
Message-ID: <D9C32CFE-122C-4DAD-94E1-6CBFE2D4E00A@unil.ch>

Dear Members of the List,

I am looking for studies on pot making in ancient India, by which I mean more specifically Vedic times, the Mah?bh?rata at the youngest.
I am aware of the studies of Ikari on the ukh?, of Houben and Van Buitenen on the mah?v?ra, but is there anything new in this field?
Also: is there a "gha?ak?ra??stra" somewhere (even if only in manuscript form)?

Thanks in advance,


Dr Fran?ois Voegeli
