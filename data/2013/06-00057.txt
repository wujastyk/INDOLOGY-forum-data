[INDOLOGY] Pot making in ancient India
Dear Members of the List,
I am looking for studies on pot making in ancient India, by which I mean more specifically Vedic times, the Mah?bh?rata at the youngest.
I am aware of the studies of Ikari on the ukh?, of Houben and Van Buitenen on the mah?v?ra, but is there anything new in this field?
Also: is there a "gha?ak?ra??stra" somewhere (even if only in manuscript form)?
Thanks in advance,
