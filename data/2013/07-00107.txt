Subject: [INDOLOGY] Three articles
Message-ID: <8D057DCBAA82D0D-167C-1941B@Webmail-m107.sysops.aol.com>

Dear Indologists,


I need the following three articles.


1. S. Krishnaswami Aiyangar, 'Tiruma?kai-A?v?r and his date', Indian Antiquary, vol. 35, pp.285-93.


2. S. Krishnaswami Aiyangar, 'Tiruma?kai-A?v?r and Danti -Durga', Quartely Journal of the Mythic Society, vol. 12, 1921-2


3. K. G. Sesha Ayyar, 'Tiruma?kai-A?v?r and Danti -Durga', Journal of the Mythic Society, vol. 9, No. 4.


Apparently, the articles of S. Krishnaswami Aiyangar are also reprinted in Ancient India and South Indian History and Culture, vol. 2: south Indian History and Culture, Poona, 1941, pp. 736-62.


I would appreciate if anybody can send me these articles as PDF if possible.


Thanks in advance


Regards,
Palaniappan
