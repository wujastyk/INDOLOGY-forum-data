[INDOLOGY] Three articles
Dear Indologists,
I need the following three articles.
1. S. Krishnaswami Aiyangar, 'Tiruma?kai-A?v?r and his date', Indian Antiquary, vol. 35, pp.285-93.
2. S. Krishnaswami Aiyangar, 'Tiruma?kai-A?v?r and Danti -Durga', Quartely Journal of the Mythic Society, vol. 12, 1921-2
3. K. G. Sesha Ayyar, 'Tiruma?kai-A?v?r and Danti -Durga', Journal of the Mythic Society, vol. 9, No. 4.
Apparently, the articles of S. Krishnaswami Aiyangar are also reprinted in Ancient India and South Indian History and Culture, vol. 2: south Indian History and Culture, Poona, 1941, pp. 736-62.
I would appreciate if anybody can send me these articles as PDF if possible.
Thanks in advance
Regards,
Palaniappan
