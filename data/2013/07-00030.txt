[INDOLOGY] question for European Indologists
Dear Judit,
I was of course mentioning the Sanskrit chair of the Coll?ge de France in a historical perspective, as the starting point of the French instituted tradition of Sanskrit studies (there no longer exists a "Sanskrit chair" a such in this institute*, where the chair holder has the special privilege to teach only the researches he carries or what else he wants; after the recent retiring of the holder of the chair in history of India and Greater India, there is still a chair of Indo-Iranian languages and religions - both Fussman and Kellens had previously taught Sanskrit, respectively in Strasbourg and Li?ge, before to reach the Coll?ge, where the former has continued to propose reading of Sanskrit texts). It is true that Paris 3 / Sorbonne is the only university in France to offer a full undegraduate (and graduate) degree in classical Indology, but beside your own lectures in Sanskrit in Lille 3 university, it should be added that there is still optional courses of Sanskrit (two levels or years) at least in Strasbourg:

and Lyon 3:

where students can thus be initiated in order to be able to attend graduate (Paris 3) or post-graduate level courses (EPHE, EHESS etc.).
Formerly, there were real "chairs" of Sanskrit in the last three universities (ending respectively with Oguibenine and Varenne, and... I do not know for Lyon, where there was Paul Regnaud in the 19th century, and also Renou before he came to Paris), but where these old (individual) chairs were not transformed into real Indological departments/teams (as in Paris 3), it became impossible to keep there the (full) degrees in the field (same here in Belgium, where only the university of Ghent did that).
Best wishes,
Christophe
* I may be wrong, but Sylvain L?vi's "chaire de langue et litt?rature sanscrite" was the last "Sanskrit" self-declared one in the Coll?ge.
