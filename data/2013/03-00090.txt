[INDOLOGY] Nagararjuna finger pointing to moon reference?
For those interested in the citation for Lamotte's original French version of that passage, it is:
Lamotte, ?tienne. Le Trait? de la Grande Vertu de Sagesse de N?g?rjuna (Mah?praj??p?ramit???stra), Tome 1, Louvain-la-Neuve: Universit? de Louvain, 1981, p. 538.

    "Relying on the meaning (arthapratisara?a), since goodwill or malice, defect or merit, falsity or truth, cannot be attributed to meaning. It is the letter (vya?jana) that indicates the meaning (artha), but the meaning is not the letter. Suppose a man points his finger at the moon to people who doubt the moon's presence; if these doubters fixate on the finger but do not look at the moon, this man tells them: "I am pointing to the moon with my finger so that you may notice the moon. Why do you fixate on my finger instead of looking at the moon?"  It is the same here: the letter (vya?jana) is the finger pointing to the meaning (artha), but the letter is not the meaning. This is why one should not rely on the letter."
