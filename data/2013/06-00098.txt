This book presents a short philosophical treatise in which twenty rival 
theories of the liberated state (/mok//s.//a/) are introduced and 
countered, and a long, discursive commentary that explores and develops 
the arguments that the treatise advances or implies. The original 
treatise comprises fifty-nine Sanskrit verses composed by Sadyojyotih 
(c. 675--725 AD), the earliest named S'aiva philosopher of the 
Mantrama-rga of whom works survive. The commentator, Bhat.t.a 
Ra-makant.ha (c. 950--1000 AD), was a Kashmirian whose writings 
systematised the doctrines of the classical S'aiva Siddha-nta, for some 
centuries the dominant school of tantric S'aivism.


Presented here is a first critical edition of these interlinked works 
and a richly annotated English translation. A lightly annotated 
introduction lays out clearly the ideas that the edited texts expound. 
Their study casts light not only on the history of S'aiva thought, but 
also on a number of religio-philosophical doctrines for which little 
other testimony survives.
