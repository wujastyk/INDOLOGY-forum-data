Dear Colleagues,

I remember having erased, perhaps too quickly, a message concerning the address of Mrs Deshpande. If it is Vijaya Deshpande, I can be of some help, for she wrote an article in a book I recently reviewed "Scientific Literature in Sanskrit" (ed.S.R.Sarma & G.Wojtilla). Her address id vijaya.deshpande at gmail.com
