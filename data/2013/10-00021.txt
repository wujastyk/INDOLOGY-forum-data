Subject: [INDOLOGY] dharma in Rg Veda
Message-ID: <CAOuG4CZMXpSPcs361QjGKggVM5iXtpYZFuWwi2d4nL9EusGf+Q@mail.gmail.com>

I would recommend as a starting point for further research the chapter
"Dharma in the Self-Understanding of Traditional Hinduism" by W. Halbfass
in his* India and Europe. An Eassay in Philosophical Understanding*. Delhi:
Motilal Banarsidass, 1990, p.310-333, which highlights historical
continuities as well as breaks in the use of the words *dharman *and *dharma
*in pre-modern brahmanical circles of South Asia.
