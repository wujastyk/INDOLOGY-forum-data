[INDOLOGY] Fwd: New Sanskrit-Eng. dictionary (program)
I've never found a good way to use .db (i.e., database) files on a Mac.  However, you can view/edit them with the free SQLite Database Browser (and though I don't own the software, I imagine FileMaker Pro would import .db files).
SQLite at http://sourceforge.net/projects/sqlitebrowser/
My best,

Is this also available in Mac-compatible format?
