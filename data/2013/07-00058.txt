of painting. From personal knowledge I may state that a collection of Mughal
oil paintings (reproduced in colored print) was published by the erstwhile
Soviet Union and made available in India in the late nineteen-fifties. They
were apparently influenced by contemporary ?continental renaissance painting. The painters
were not Indian but, perhaps Iranian as far as I remember. The original
paintings were not earlier than the seventeenth century. The themes were
secular, as far as I remember. The collection belonged to Pt. Karumnamay
Saraswati (1904-1977), a learned religious man of Calcutta with many devotees.

Does anyone know the first recorded of painting canvas or cloth in India? When did it become popular?
