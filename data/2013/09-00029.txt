[INDOLOGY] Indian Studies: In Honor of Charles Rockwell Lanman
I'm extremely grateful to Ashok Aklujkar for passing on to me a PDF of
the *Indian
Studies ... Lanman* book.  I have added the PDF to the Internet Archive,
since it is out of copyright.

At the Archive, the derivative copies (DjVu, Kindle, online reader) take
some time to be automatically derived from the uploaded PDF.  If you check
back in a few hours or tomorrow, that processing should be complete.
Best,
