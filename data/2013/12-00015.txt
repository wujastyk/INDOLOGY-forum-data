[INDOLOGY] Sanskrit Dictionary App for iPhone and iPad
The new Academic Room Skt Dictionary iPhone app sounds great in that it combines multiple dictionaries.  There is also an existing free Monier-Williams app which I have been using till now:

Fre
Mac computers: dictionaries can be added to the Dictionary app by inserting .dictionary files into the Dictionary folder inside the system Library folder.  R. Pollock has used DictUnifier (as Charles DiSimone suggests in the preceding message) to produce a decent version of MW:

(the link to the compressed 40 MB file is buried in the middle of a paragraph:

I find it very convenient to be able to search MW using the Mac Dictionary app, though there is the problem that some entries that refer to another entry in another column cannot be tracked down easily, and there are a few miscoded words.

Re: [INDOLOGY] Sanskrit Dictionary App for iPhone and iPad
Dear James,
If you need an offline Sanskrit dict for OSX there are several options.
With an app called DictUnifier you can turn stardict files into mac dictionary files and search them from Apple's native dictionary app.  It is quite convenient and useful, with many dictionaries available (MW, Apte, the Pali Text Society dict, etc.):

You can also use the Kotonoko app, which has dictionaries available for MW, Apte, Tibetan dicts, and many others:

You can even make the K?ln online MW dict available locally on your hard drive for offline use:

Additionally, while I am quite pleased to see this new iOS dictionary, I'd like to point out that there are several Sanskrit dictionaries available in the app store for free in case anyone wants to save $5 (not that this is an expensive price for the convenience of these dictionaries in your pocket!).
Best wishes,
Charlie

Dear Indology Folks,
This announcement comes courtesy of Harpreet Singh at Harvard. Exciting news!
ANNOUNCEMENT: Sanskrit Dictionary App for iPhone and iPad
Our national nightmare of lugging around Monier-Williams is finally over.  We have just released a Sanskrit dictionary app for iPhone and iPad. The app, developed in the Harvard Innovation Lab, combines three major dictionaries that are commonly used by scholars of Sanskrit--Monier-Williams, Apte and Macdonell. In addition, references from dhatu-patha (a collection of verbal roots with final forms) are also provided, when available. All words can be searched using a Devanagari keyboard.  Once downloaded, the app does not require internet access to operate. Special thanks to the faculty in Harvard's Department of South Asian Studies for their encouragement and support during the app's development.
