[INDOLOGY] Devanagari keyboard
Two years or so ago I wrote to the MS customer service because I couldn't believe that MS Word for Mac is unable to handle Devanagari. They answered quite politely, checked the issue and finally told me that I would have to accept the situation. As far as I can see, MS have not bothered to add this feature in the meantime, which throws some light on their evaluation of the Devanagari market, so to speak. Pages, Open Office, Nisus Writer, even TextEdit have no problem at all.
Best wishes,
Sven
