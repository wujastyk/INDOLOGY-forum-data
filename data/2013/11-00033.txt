Subject: [INDOLOGY] Devanagari keyboard

Two years or so ago I wrote to the MS customer service because I couldn't believe that MS Word for Mac is unable to handle Devanagari. They answered quite politely, checked the issue and finally told me that I would have to accept the situation. As far as I can see, MS have not bothered to add this feature in the meantime, which throws some light on their evaluation of the Devanagari market, so to speak. Pages, Open Office, Nisus Writer, even TextEdit have no problem at all.
Best wishes,
Sven

> One can of course always type into a Gmail letter using the Devanagari keyboard, which also uses the 'f' key for vir?ma's. In this method the conjunct consonants come out nicely.  One can then copy and paste the text in MS-Word.  Keep the keyboard set to Devanagari QWERTY, and type one letter into the word document, e.g. ?.  Then put the cursor immediately after the ?, and use the Edit, Paste and match formatting.  This will take in your Devanagari into Word on the Mac.  The problem is that Word 'undoes' the conjuncts and turns, for example, ?????? into something like ??? ?? ?? ?, at least with Devanagri Samgam MN as the font.  Might someone know of another font that would keep the conjuncts?

For conjuncts, as Tim has said, you type the first consonant, then "f" (vir?ma) and then the second consonant; if there is a third, then you retype "f" and type the third consonant.
