[INDOLOGY] Devanagari keyboard
Dear Hans,
I do not work very much with Mac myself. But, as I recall, it is fairly easy to find
and set the language and keyboard options in the recent versions of Mac OS X.
I haven't used it enough, however, to know the details of the keyboard layout.
Perhaps someone who uses mostly Mac can help you with this.
good luck,
Matthew
