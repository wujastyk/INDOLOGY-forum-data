[INDOLOGY] Sanskrit syntax
Let me also -- since we are in the admiring mood -- add my own voice to this. And to think that it was done in 1886!! I am privileged to have the original edition of 1886 published in Leyden (so spelled) by E.J. Brill. It once belonged to Shackleton Bailey and is still in perfect condition, and I really don't have any problems reading the Devanagari, although it is in an old, but beautiful, font.
