Ratimanjari 8 describes the 'elephant-like' woman.  Here's a possible translation of the quote:  "With thick womb, thick buttocks and lips, thick fingers, thick breasts, amiable, eager for love, delighting in intense sexual passion, a tremendous eater, (unusually short), indeed the hastini is, she is considered the female elephant."

See for example Kalacakratantra/Vimalaprabha, Abhishekapatala vss 138-144, wherein the 'Elephant' yogi is described as a passionate lover who also moves slowly, is extremely foolish, and has a putrid smell.

The expression is usually thought to come from Kalidasa but I've not found it in a cursory search of his work.  The earliest occurrences seem to be in the Mahabharata.  Any confirmation of texts using gajagamini and details of elephant similes in kavya would be welcome e.g.  women's thighs like elephant trunks, breasts like elephants' bosses.
