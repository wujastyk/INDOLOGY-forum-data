Subject: [INDOLOGY] Welcome to the new new INDOLOGY list.
Message-ID: <CAKdt-CffKq63dAA232hjjsgcmjvLzC+=gHYgJVzPZsn6CLR1Fg@mail.gmail.com>

In November 1990, I wrote:

 This is -- I believe -- the first message of human origin to be posted to
the new INDOLOGY discussion list. (You will have received a standard,
introductory message, explaining some of the technical workings of this
system; it is very straightforward in normal use.)

So may I welcome you warmly to this new forum, and encourage you to
contribute your thoughts, queries, answers, observations, and announcements
relating to Indology.
I would like to repeat this welcome now that the INDOLOGY list has moved to
its new location.  Welcome back!

Dominik
