[INDOLOGY] Mahabharata
Hello Howard,
My apologies, I did not realize the files were no longer there. My own  
copies were downloaded from that site.
Does anyone on the list know if Smith is still maintaining the site? I  
would be happy to send my appendix/apparatus files back to him if need  
be, or can upload them somewhere (any suggestions?) they could be  
accessed by the list.
Best,
Chris
