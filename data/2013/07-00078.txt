There is a short obituary notice of Dumont by  K. V. Sarma in Vishv. Ind. Jnl 7, 1969, 157f. According to my files (Ballini's obituary in  RSO 16, 1936, 155-158) Pull? moved from Pisa to Bologna only in 1903. 
Best,
Klaus

Presently, beside his Indological writings and  a few family archives, I only have the reference to an obituary published in the Baltimore Sun (or The Sun, Baltimore) on the 10th of December 1968 (but no copy of it). Any living testimony would be also appreciated.
