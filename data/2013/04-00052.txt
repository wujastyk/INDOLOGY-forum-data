[INDOLOGY] Ind-senz OCR software for Sanskrit
I fully agree with the positive evaluation of McComas Taylor and Juergen.
A useful feature of Oliver Hellwig's devanagari OCR is that you can SCAN
the text in Devanagari and EXPORT it to your office applications in
(searchable and editable) roman transcription. Exporting in Devanagari is
of course also possible but for searching and editing you will have to face
all problems of vowel "maatraas" and ligatures.
