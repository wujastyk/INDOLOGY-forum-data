[INDOLOGY] Buddhist Citation
Dear Patrick,
I am presently away from my library and so can only hazard a guess, but it may be worthwhile to check if K is
paraphrasing something from the Mah?y?nas?tr?lamk?ra or the Abhisamay?y?lamk?ra. The general idea that
the bodhisattva takes to himself the fruitsof the world's evils, while aspiring for itsfull liberation, is
quite widespread in Mah?y?na literature in any case. 
best,
Matthew

[INDOLOGY] Buddhist Citation
I wonder whether any of you can help me with a citation in Kum?rila's Tantrav?rttika (on PMS 1.3.4; ?nSS p. 114).
buddh?de? punar ayam eva vyatikromo 'ala?k?rubuddhau sthita? | tenaivam ?ha |
 kalikalu?ak?t?ni y?ni loke mayi nipatantu vimucyat?? tu loka? ||
Does anyone know of a Buddhist text called Ala?k?rabuddhi? Or is this a misreading of a different text with a similar name?
Thanks.
Patrick
