Dear Colleagues,

Rohana Seneviratne was so kind to send a pdf of the work to me in no time! As she says, the quality is not great at all, but mostly legible. You can download it from here:

https://www.dropbox.com/s/6rrezg6m2r8dceo/Krsnavilasa%20of%20Sukumara.pdf

The edition Rohana made available is the one published in Palghat/Palakkad with only the first four cantos in it. 

The Jayammal's edition (1982) seems to be available (in Europe) only at the British Library and at the Libraries of the Universities of T?bingen ( http://swb2.bsz-bw.de/DB=2.312/SET=1/TTL=1/SHW?FRST=2/PRS=HOL&HILN=888&ADI_LND= ) and G?ttingen ( https://opac.sub.uni-goettingen.de/DB=1/LNG=DU/CLK?IKT=12&TRM=018701094 ).

Best wishes,

Marco

> In my case, not at first for the the poem (of which I have the text + English  transl. and notes by K.P.A. Menon, Nag Publishers, 1996,  Nine Gems of Sanskrit literature vol. 1), but for Raamapaa.nivaada's commentary.
> Of the the K???avil?sa itself, It seems that there is only one edition of the complete text in 12 sargas (on which Menon relies): by K. Jayammal (Ph.D. Thesis of the University of Madras, 1979, under K. Kunjunni Raja, see the latter 1958, p. 196-98, 1980 add. p. xiii), publ. by Higginbothams Ltd in 1982.
> The  references I have for the commentary are : 
> ? Sree Krishna vilasa kavyam of Sukumara kavi / Sri krsnavilasakavyam, with a Sanskrit commentary `Vilasini' by Rama Panivada and English translation, exhaustive notes, etc. by T.K. Ramachandra Aiyar, 3rd ed., Palghat : R.S. Vadhyar & Sons, Sanskrit study made easy series
> This popular edition has the first four cantos only.
> ? An edition of the K???avil?sa (I have note the precise title) published in the Kerala-granthamaalaa Series, Phalgat, 1906-1908, also incomplete (8 sargas only).
> A few other editions, without, or with other, commentary/ies are listed in the useful (neglected) L. Sulochana Devi's Historical Survey of Sanskrit Mahaakaavyas [of Kerala], Kanishka Publishing House, 1992, p. 11, but the complete commentary of Raamapaa.nivaada does not appear.
> Interestingly, I found in the introduction of another work by Raamapaa.nivaada that "Vil?sin? is intended for the beginners of Sanskrit... is usually prescribed to beginners who study Sanskrit in Kerala".
> It is therefore not impossible that Raamapaa.nivaada did not comment the whole text.

>> Dear Collegues,
>> 
>> does anyone happen to have a pdf of Sukum?ra's K???avil?sa with the commentary called Vil?sin? by R?map??iv?da? I'm trying to identify an incomplete grantha manuscript: it seems to contain parts of that work, but to be sure I need to check the manuscript against the edition.

>> Thank you very much in advance.
