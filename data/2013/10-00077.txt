Dear Colleagues,
Rohana Seneviratne was so kind to send a pdf of the work to me in no time! As she says, the quality is not great at all, but mostly legible. You can download it from here:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/6rrezg6m2r8dceo/Krsnavilasa%20of%20Sukumara.pdf
The edition Rohana made available is the one published in Palghat/Palakkad with only the first four cantos in it. 
The Jayammal's edition (1982) seems to be available (in Europe) only at the British Library and at the Libraries of the Universities of T?bingen ( http://swb2.bsz-bw.de/DB=2.312/SET=1/TTL=1/SHW?FRST=2/PRS=HOL&HILN=888&ADI_LND= ) and G?ttingen ( https://opac.sub.uni-goettingen.de/DB=1/LNG=DU/CLK?IKT=12&TRM=018701094 ).
Best wishes,
Marco
