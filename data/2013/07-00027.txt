 From that place, one can (for instance) reach the following page, which 
has the texts of all the twelve Tirumu?ai-s.
"http://www.tamilvu.org/library/l4100/html/l4100ind.htm"
This is of course all in Tamil script,
but can easily be converted to transliteration
(or to any Indian script)
by using Vinodh Rajan's "Akshara Tools".
See:

P.S. will you make the Schomerus recordings available online?
