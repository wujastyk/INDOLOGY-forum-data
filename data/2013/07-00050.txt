Subject: [INDOLOGY] Digital Versions of PTS Texts?

Dear Charles,

The Dhammakaya temple group in Thailand have produced CD-ROMs of the
Pali Text Society editions. Successive versions of the electronic
editions have been called PaliText 1.0, 2.0 etc. I think the most
recent version is PaliText Version 2.6.

The initial version was academically assessed by Mark Allon here:

"An Assessment of the Dhammakaya CD-ROM: Palitext Version 1.0.?.
Buddhist Studies (Bukky? Kenky?) Vol. 26: (1997) pp.109?29.

The question of where they can be lawfully obtained outside of
Thailand is one for others I'm afraid.

Kind regards,
Antonio Ferreira-Jardim
Brisbane, Australia
