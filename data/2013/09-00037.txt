[INDOLOGY] Pratishakya of Shatapatha Brahmana
Hello James,
     The s?tra text that specifically deals with the accents of the
?atapatha-Br?hma?a is called Bh??ikas?tra.  It is generally not called a
Pr?ti??khya.  I don't have a pdf of this text.  If you find one, do send it
to me.  Best,
Madhav Deshpande
