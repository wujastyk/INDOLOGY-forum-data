[INDOLOGY] Devanagari keyboard
Actually, no, Patrick, the shift is only for retroflex consonants.  No
shift keypress is required for the conjuncts.  And one is going to have to
use *something* to distinguish retroflexes.
Modern script-rendering software knows all about viramas, which is how it
can build a conjunct without having to be told.  If you actually *want* a
virama on the screen, you just type a consonant with a following space (no
vowel).  Which seems totally logical to me, and requires no superfluous
keypresses.  So typing "karman " -> "??????"
Basically, every time you type "f", you are doing something you don't need
to do, from a technical point of view.  It's a labour overhead imposed by
poor software design.
