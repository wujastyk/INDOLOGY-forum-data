[INDOLOGY] molten lead in ears
Dear Colleagues,
Could someone please point me towards the reference where ?udras would have
molten lead or some other substance poured into their ears as punishment
for having heard the recitation of Sanskrit mantras.
I'm wondering also what punishment would be dispensed to someone uttering
Sanskrit verses or perhaps speaking Sanskrit.
All the best,
