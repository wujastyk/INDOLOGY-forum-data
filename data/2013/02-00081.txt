Subject: [INDOLOGY] The Karanakesari by Bhaskara (fl. ca. 1681)
Message-ID: <5124A554.6030109@canterbury.ac.nz>

Dear List,

I am currently working on an astronomical work written in Sanskrit 
called the  KaraNakezari by  BhAskara (fl. ca. 1681) with my colleague 
Kim Plofker.  The work is only 20 verses long; the first verse gives 
some background on the author and makes reference to his lineage. 
BhAskara we are told is the son of RAma and is a descendent  from the 
"family" ("kula") called  KavIndra.

Can anyone recommend any scholarly sources which set out the details 
surrounding the varna/kula etc hierarchy, or where to find out more (if 
possible) about the KavIndra kula?

The title of this work is also puzzling; kezarin is of course an 
adj/noun which means having a mane/a lion (among other meanings), but it 
could also be a family name, which perhaps it is here.  Is this familiar 
to anyone?

Many thanks in advance for any help,

Clemency
