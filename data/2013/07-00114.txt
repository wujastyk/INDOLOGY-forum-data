[INDOLOGY] publication
I too am sadden to learn of the passing of Prof. S. D. Joshi. He was 
most kind to me during both of my extended stays in Pune, once as a 
graduate student in 1976-77 at CASS and once as an AIIS scholar 
affiliated with Deccan College in 1984--85. As Prof. Cardona pointed 
out, we are grateful to have his legacy, both in terms of his published 
work and in terms of his erudite students.
