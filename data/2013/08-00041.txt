[INDOLOGY] "On the Literature of the Hindus" ?
I've not read the French versions since the English versions are readily
accessible through google books and archive. org.  However, generally (and
I am not sure where I read this) but when a section from the Jones edited
volumes has "commentary" at the head, the author is Jones (who as president
of the organization and presumably editor-in-chief is sometimes uncredited).
