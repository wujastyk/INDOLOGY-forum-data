I'm still nagging at what Kaiya?a means by "karma?i gha?".  My present best
idea is that he's invoking P.3.3.19 *akartari ca k?rake sa?j??y?m*.  This
implies an origin from *mlich*, which is odd, but can be ignored, I think.
So "*mleccha*" is the recipient of the action.  This may explain the future
pass. part. that N?ge?a uses, *nindy?* "to *be* blamed" (passive).  *Mleccha
* = "despicable", i.e., it is the *recipient* of criticism.  And P.3.3.19
makes "*mleccha*" a *sa?j??*, which is right too. (I don't believe that P.
meant *ca* to negate *sa?j??y?m*, even if this *gha?* is desired in non-*
sa?j??* cases.)

I hope someone can improve on this :-)
