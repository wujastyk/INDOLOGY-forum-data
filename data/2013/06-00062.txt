[INDOLOGY] Brahmin in Akam 337? (Re: dacoits, bandits, thugs and other unsavory characters)
Dear Suresh,
As far as I know, the words, p?rpp?r/p?pp?r do not occur in Tamil-Brahmi inscriptions. The word p?rpp?r occurs in Pullur plates of Nandivarman II of the 8th century. 
As I said I do not subscribe to the etymology of p?rpp?r from p?r- 'to see'. But Caldwell glosses p?rpp?r as 'overseers' clearly seeing the etymology of p?r 'to see'. (See http://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil_elib/Cdw856__Caldwell_ComparativeGrammarDravidian.pdf, p.79)  And if you look at the Malayalam  word Ma. p?rppavar the seers, brahmans in DEDR 4091b, one can understand why DEDR has grouped it that way. 
As for your second point, as DEDR notes we may have some contamination with Skt. br?hma?a- and its derivatives in the words b??pu??u brahman; fem. b??pata; b??pana the brahman caste. On the other hand, these forms may be related to IA bappa. In Pullur plates, the Sanskrit section has bappa bha???raka while the Tamil section has p?rpp?r, referring to the same group of brahmins. Moreover, that the form p?r alone can indicate a brahmin suggests that we dot really have to derive it from br?hma?a.  
I agree with your third point. I was mentioning p???i as a synonym and not as a cognate.

Considering that the form p?rpp?r often occurs as p?pp?r, clearly even as late as 9th century 'p?rpp??', its singular form, must not have been restricted to refer to brahmins.[...] if one were to consider the term 'p?rpp??' linguistically, we see that the usual interpretation that it referred to brahmins as seers based on 'p?r-' 'to see' (as implied by DEDR 4091a and b as given below) is unwarranted.
Dear Palaniappan:  
Very interesting discussion. What percentage of the Tamil-Brahmi inscriptions show the spelling of p?pp?r as opposed to p?rpp?r?
1. I believe p?r (-pp-, -tt-) 'to see' is unrelated to  p?(r)pp?? 'Brahmin';  Although DEDR grouped them under the same entry (4091a and 4091b), I am not very sure if we can make a semantic connection of 'see' with 'seer' in Dravidian. 
2. CDIAL entry 9327 shows Pk. ba?bha?a,S. ???bha?u, kal. ba?bhana, OB. b?mbha?a, Or. b?mbhu?a, b?bhu?a, Bi. Mth. b?bhan, Bhoj.b?mhan, b?bhan, among other reflexes. We cannot ignore the close similarity of these reflexes with Te. b??p??u, Ta. p?pp??.
3. I think you would agree that connecting p???i/p???i with p?(r)pp?? is a bit far fetched.
Without more information about the socio-linguistic situation of the early periods of the Indo-Aryan and Davidian interaction, I think, we cannot easily determine if p?r (-pp-, -tt-) 'to see' is related to  p?(r)pp?? 'Brahmin' or not.
