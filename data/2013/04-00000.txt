Hello all,

Can anyone help me by identifying what is being cited here? It does not
seem to be RgVedic or from the early Upanishads:

'Thus every object has its corresponding *devata*. The *rishi* is perfectly
explicit when he says, ?Jalavimamini devata,? ?Bidyudavimamini devata?
etc., i.e., the ?devata? which illuminates water, the ?devata? which
illuminates lightning, etc.'

The quotation is from pp. 143-44 of Girindrasekhar Bose, "The Psychological
Outlook of Hindu Philosophy," *Indian Journal of Psychology* 5 (1930:
119-46; repr. *The Modern Review*. Jan. 1931: 14-25.

Thanks for any reply,
