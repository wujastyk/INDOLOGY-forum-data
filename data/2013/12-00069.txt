[INDOLOGY] Publication Announcement
Sorry about that. It was indeed a slip on my part. The pali just has "hutam," (that which is offered) and not a reference to the sacrificial official.  Sorry for the confusion.

Re: [INDOLOGY] Publication Announcement
When I saw "yajna and hotara" in this thread I understood the second word as a slip
for "hotra", a near-synonym of yajna (though strictly referring to the part of the yajna
performed by the hot.r). Is that what was intended?
