[INDOLOGY] Leiden Summer School programme online
Dear All,
The programme of this year's Leiden Summer School in Languages and
Linguistics is online. For details and a link to the programme see the
message below. As every year, the summer school includes a full
Indological programme but also allows for a combination of courses to
meet the students' individual interests.
