Right, Hans,

This usage is also referred to by MW (??? ???? ??? ????? ??????? ??? ????, " the gods then saw this thunderbolt, to wit , the water "?S3Br.)

It seems to be the best possibility so far, but hard to interpret, always confusing this use of yad...

Thanks to all

Dear All,

A clue as to how to interpret yad apazabdaH?may lie in the morphology of apabhASitavai, which is a Vedic formation; not also the Vedic particles ha vai. This may make it possible to interpret the passage mleccho ha vai eSo yad apazabdaH?as an instance of what I have termed the "invariable yad-construction" (see the grammatical notes in my UpaniSadic Reader); so the translation would be something like this 'That indeed is barbarous [taking mleccha?as adjective], namely/viz. incorrect speech.'

All the best,

Hans Henrich Hock

One might think, N?ge?a said, that the word mleccha would usually refer to a person or a place; how could it refer to a bad word?? But in this case it is a term of criticism.? "A bad word (apa?abda) is really despicable (mleccha)."?
