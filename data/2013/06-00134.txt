Dear All,

On a related note, I would be interested to know to what extent traditional
Sanskrit grammars have been/are being taught at various universities - this
would include the use of Sanskrit terminology to the citation and
discussion of sutras. I know Oxford has a regular course on Panini as part
of the Sanskrit BA and that Professor Ingalls used to teach a course on
Panini at Harvard with some regularity. I'm also familiar with Goldmans'
use of Sanskrit terminology. Additional information would be of great
interest.

Many Thanks,
