The author offers a detailed analysis of the arguments against the Brahmanic ?naturalization of caste, ?as propounded by Dharmakirti (ca. 600 CE) and his successors up to Prajnakaragupta (ca. 800 CE), and in the process pays close attention to their historical context as exemplified by the writings of Aryadeva, Vasubandhu, Dharmapala, and Candrakirti. The first section provides a survey of the canonical material in relevant Pali Suttas and subsequent Avadana and Jataka literature. The main part of the book presents the final stage in the evolution of polemics against the ?naturalization? of caste in the sense of ?any attempt to include caste among the things that do not depend or proceed exclusively from human thought and arbitrary conventions, i.e., to consider caste as agreeing with nature and not merely with people?s social and linguistic habits.
