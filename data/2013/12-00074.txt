[INDOLOGY] Smara
In reply one can cite the following verse of the ancient Sivamahimnastava:
asiddhArthA naiva kvachidapi sadevAsuranare
nivartante nityaM jagati jayino yasya vishikhAH .
sa pashyannIsha tvAmitarasurasaadhAraNamabhUt.h
smaraH smartavyAtmA na hi vashishhu pathyaH paribhavaH ..

The cupid's(love-god `manmatha's) (flower) arrows never return
unaccomplished whether the victims are gods or demons or men . However O,
master! he has now become just a *remembered soul* (without body),since he
looked upon you as any other ordinary god, shot his arrow and got burnt to
ashes,in no time . Insulting masters (who have controlled their senses),
does one no good .
Ganesan
