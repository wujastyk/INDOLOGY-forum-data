Message-ID: <161227098543.23782.4294098373107016000.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear colleagues,

I am pleased to announce that the well-established tradition of 
International Dharmak?rti Conferences ? Ky?to (1982), Vienna (1989), 
Hiroshima (1997) and, again, Vienna (2005) ? will be continued with the 
Fifth International Dharmak?rti Conference in Heidelberg from 25-29 
August, 2014.

The conference is aimed to showcase current research on all aspects of 
Buddhist epistemology and logic in India, China or Tibet from a 
historical, philological and/or philosophical perspective. Papers may 
also address aspects of the relationship of Buddhist pram??a to other 
currents of thought within Buddhism or in the respectively pertinent 
broader intellectual environment.

The conference is scheduled for the week immediately after the IABS 
conference in Vienna (August 18-23), to facilitate participation in both 
conferences for scholars from overseas.

To receive further circulars for the Dharmak?rti conference in the 
future, please subscribe to the conference mailing-list at this website:

circular are already subscribed to the list. An online registration

With best regards,

Birgit Kellner
