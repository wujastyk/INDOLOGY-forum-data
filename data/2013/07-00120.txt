I had the privilege of reading privately the Mah?bh??ya with S. D. Joshi in December 1963, when I was working on my doctoral dissertation (on the 14th ?hnika).? In addition to the clarity of his comment, I enjoyed participating in a tradition of oral instruction of vy?kara?a of which he was a master.? He remained a dear friend and an example of positive scholarship.

With sadness we learn of the demise of Prof. Shivaram Dattatray Joshi, who has been for many decades, in the words of his friend, student and close collaborator Dr. J.A.F. Roodbergen, ?il maestro di color che sanno in the field of Sanskrit grammar.? He will live on, to use Brendan Gillon's terms, in "his published work" and in "his erudite students" (who have become the teachers of?P??ini-students of my own generation). ?
