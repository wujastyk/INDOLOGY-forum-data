[INDOLOGY] History of Indian Literature, Vol 1. Fasc. 3
Dear colleagues,
I need an information whether the third fascicle of the first volume of Jan
Gonda's History of Indian Literature (the volume on the Upanisads, by Jean
Varenne) was ever printed. I did not manage to find any record of it.
Kind regards
Aleksandar
