Dear Patrick,
it is true that cakora is not only drinking moonbeams, but also deriving pleasure gazing at the moon. But it is also claimed that in the proximity of a poison cakora's red eyes become discoloured (e.g. KA? 1, 20, 8; Su?ruta Kalpa 1, 30?33). Could this explain your case? I have discussed the poison-detecting animals in my article, ?Monkeys kept in Royal Stables?, Traditional South Asian Medicine 6, 2001, 51?61.

Best,
Klaus
