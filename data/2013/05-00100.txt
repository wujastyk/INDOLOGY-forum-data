[INDOLOGY] Query on negation
Yes, indeed, the Pune dictionary cites adharmaj?a (Manu 8.59), but only as one who does not know dharma. The only example of "one who knows adharma" is, obviously, in the compound dharm?dharmaj?a. But the dictionary does make the useful distinction in the Roman transliteration:
a-dharmaj?a and adharma-j?a.
a-dharmacary? and adharma-cara?a, etc.
