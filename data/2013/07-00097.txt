[INDOLOGY] scribal self-recitation while copying
dear Colleagues.
Recently I told a student that errors in transcription which appear prima
facie to be due to oral recitation may well also stem from copying a
written exemplar, since scribes are known to recite to themselves, as it
were, when copying. I think/thought that this was well known, but she tells
me that she's looked around and not found a discussion of this idea. I have
no idea now where I learnt it (although i believe it to be true). Any
references?
thanks so much, jonathan
