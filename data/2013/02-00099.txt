Founders of Western Indology presents in high relief the central roles 
two scholars, one German, one English, played in establishing classical 
Indology in Europe. Their correspondence, edited here for the first 
time, with extensive introductions and annotations, documents the 
formative decades during which, under Schlegel's leadership, incipient 
Indic scholarship in Europe strove first to use, and promptly to 
transcend, the work of British amateur scholars in India and their 
reliance on Indian pandit teachers.
The study by Rosane and Ludo Rocher illuminates the international ambit 
of competition and controversy in which Indian studies became 
institutionalized and professionalized, most notably at Prussian 
universities after a first chair was created in Paris and societies were 
founded in Paris and in London to emulate the Asiatic Society in 
Calcutta, over which Colebrooke had presided. It captures how 
Colebrooke's gift of his unrivaled collection of manuscripts to the East 
India Library helped transfer the primary European seat of Indological 
research from Paris to London. Comparative standards of pre-university 
education come to the fore when Colebrooke entrusts a son to Schlegel's 
affectionate tutelage in Bonn. A companion to the authors' biography of 
Colebrooke (2012), this volume puts greater emphasis on Schlegel, who 
sought to consult Colebrooke's "oracle" and brought up most items for 
discussion.
