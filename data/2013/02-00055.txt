[INDOLOGY] First use of 'Indology'
It is to be noted that without using the term itself, John Stuart Mill in 1858 had his own idea about what might be called 'Indology':
" (?) India is a peculiar country; the state of society and civilization, the character and habits of the people, and the private and public rights established among them, are totally different from those which are known or recognised in this country; in fact the study of India must be as much a profession in itself as law or medecine"

Robson, Martin Moir & Zawahir Moir eds, Collected Works of John Stuart Mill, vol. 30: Writings on India, Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1990, p. 49 ; comment by Jennifer Pitts, A Turn to Empire: the rise of imperial liberalism in Britain and France, Princeton University Press, 2005, pp. 149-150).
