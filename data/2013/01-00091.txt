realistic everyday situations. Subject to personal effort, students

significant historical sites and modernity exist side by side. The

kingdom of Vijayanagara, the "City of Victory", whose kings ruled over 
vast parts of South India for around 300 years. Cultural and religious 
traditions include the Islamic culture of North Karnataka, Jainism and
