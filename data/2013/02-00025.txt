Dear Matthew,

The word *visar?ru* sounds suspiciously Dravidian. In Telugu, *visar?ru* means
"(v.) to spread out, to diffuse", which also has cognates in other
Dravidian languages (See DEDR
5450<http://kolichala.com/DEDR/searchindexid.php?q=5450>).
It is remarkable that the Traditional lexicographers in Telugu ascribed a
Sanskrit etymology for this word, deriving it from Skt. *visara?a*.

Is it possible Kamala??la was a South Indian, and influenced by the local
tradition of considering a Dravidian *visar?ru* as a Sanskrit word?

Regards,
Suresh.
