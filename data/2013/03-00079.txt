[INDOLOGY] Nagararjuna finger pointing to moon reference?
I have not time to check, but unless my memory is faulty (quite possible), 
isn't something like that found in the Kaa'syapa-parivarta ?
Best wishes,
Stephen Hodge
I  can't answer your question, but I remember seeing this expression (it's
been years and memory fades) in the Kath?sarits?gara, a decidedly
un-buddhist source....
