Subject: INDOLOGY is changing its address
Message-ID: <161227098874.23782.18444005093801074868.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear colleagues and INDOLOGY list members,

After almost 25 years being hosted at the University of Liverpool, the
INDOLOGY list is moving to a new address.

I would like to take this opportunity to send a big thank you to our
friends at Liverpool, Chris Wooff (Dept. Director, Computing) and Alan Thew
(Systems Team), who have nurtured and supported the INDOLOGY list during a
quarter of a century.  In 1990, they agreed to take on the INDOLOGY list as
a labour of love, and they have done a great deal over the years to provide
us all with a smooth, professional service.   They have been unfailingly
cheerful and friendly, even on those occasions when members' faulty email
accounts were bombarding Liverpool with thousands of error messages.  We
owe them a great deal, and send them our great thanks.  I especially send
my good wishes to Chris for much pleasure and recreation during his
retirement.

INDOLOGY's new address will come into force on Monday next week, 18
February 2013.  The new service will be at a subdomain of the
indology.infodomain (rather than at
liverpool.ac.uk).  We are currently working on transferring INDOLOGY's
precious archive to the new service, where it will continue to be public.
We shall also be transferring all your subscriptions to the new service, so
you should not need to do anything except start sending your INDOLOGY
messages to the new email address.

The new service will run on GNU
Mailman<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Mailman>software, rather than
Listserv <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listserv>.

I shall be announcing the new email address and the members' management web
page in the next few days.

Sincerely,
Dominik Wujastyk
for the INDOLOGY committee

With technical support from the INDOLOGY webmaster, Patrick Mc Allister.
