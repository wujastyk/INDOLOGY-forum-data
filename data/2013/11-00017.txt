Subject: [INDOLOGY] Vrataratnakara of Ranavira / Ranavirasimha?

I'd be much obliged for any information concerning the following multi-volume work, published around 1941-42:

Author: Ra?av?ra, or Ra?av?rasi?ha(r?ja)
Title:Vrataratn?kara
Printed by the Raghunathamudrayantralaya (place unknown)

For preliminary catalogue data of the three volumes with this title see here:
https://opac.sub.uni-goettingen.de/DB=1.BBK/FAM?PPN=77111947X

These three volumes came together with two others, "Pr?ya?cittabh?ga" and "Jyotirmah?nibandha", both without title pages. Therefore I'm not sure whether they are also part of the Vrataratnakara.


Further information on the author and the relation between the above parts would be welcome.  [Is he the Kashmiri king who sponsored the Krtyaratnakara, perhaps?]

I've checked the NCC, the printed India Office Catalogue (Sanskrit Works) and Kane's History of Dharmasastra, without success.
The DIL seems to have electronic versions, but its catalogue data are not very helpful.

Many thanks in advance
Reinhold Gr?nendahl
