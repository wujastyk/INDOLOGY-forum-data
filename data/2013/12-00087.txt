Thank you Dominik. Indeed, at least one question answered, in n. 12: transliterate ????? as pra:uga.
Best wishes,
Arlo

Dear Arlo,
Dr Anthony Stone was involved in creating ISO 15919, and I made a link to his pages from 
http://indology.info/papers/One can't get a free copy of the standard there, I'm afraid, although Anthony's pages are full of information and may answer some questions.  
Best,
Dominik
