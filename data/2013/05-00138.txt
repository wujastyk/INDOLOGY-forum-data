[INDOLOGY] Sanskrit syntax
I'm another admirer. I have a beautifully printed, sturdily bound and much used 
Japanese reprint (Rinshen-Shoten Bookstore, Kyoto, 1968). Speyer is so methodical 
that his statements still make sense despite changes in linguistic theory, so long as 
you understand his dated, Latin-based terminology; and he balances Paninian 
prescriptions with observations of actual texts.
