Dear Colleagues,
I am working on the Sm?ticandrik? of Deva??abha??a and its discussion of documents.  Several passages in the sub-section on r?ja??sana enjoin a king to inscribe a land grant ?pa?e v? t?mrapa??e v?.? Y?j?avalkya (1.319) is the first, I think.  Most translators have rendered pa?a here as ?cloth,? which makes no sense to me, as I have never seen a cloth inscription of this sort and it seems an unusually non-durable material for an important inscription.  So, Amarako?a (and MW lists this, too) gives several synonyms, all of which point to the chirauli/chironji nut (Buchanania Latifolia) or, I suppose, its bark.
Can anyone help me identify pa?a here more certainly?  I don?t know the first thing about trees and this appears to be a common enough tree in India and other parts of Asia, but is the bark of this tree meant here?  Thanks for any help or leads you may have.
Best,
