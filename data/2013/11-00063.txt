Kevin and Howard-

Thank you for your prompt responses.  I will look into both of your
suggestions in the coming days.  Also, thank you in advance to others who
reply.

I might clarify that the thrust of Zhu Xi's 'laments' are historical and
comparative.  He criticizes ritual behavior and contemporary customs as
degradations of those practices of his predecessors.  X is worse than Y
because of Z.  Zhi Xi's treatise might be more social critiques than
laments.

Thanks again,

Charlie
