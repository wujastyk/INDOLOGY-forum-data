[INDOLOGY] Query
P.s. the verse has several parallels I can dig up for you if you don't know
them, and it is historically important because it shows that for orthodox
br?hma?as at this time, contact with an initiated ?aiva is as polluting as
contact with an untouchable -- which I hope makes one hesitate to place
?aivism under the rubric "Hinduism", at least for the early medieval period.
