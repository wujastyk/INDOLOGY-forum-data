[INDOLOGY] Survey on the Vipassana Meditation Movement as taught by S. N. Goenka
Dear List Members,
Although this is a somewhat loose understanding of 'Indology', the Vipassana movement is centered in India and the technique has its origins in India, so I thought it appropriate to post here:
I am currently working on a research project on the modern Vipassana movement as taught by S. N. Goenka.
If you have sat at least one 10-day course of Vipassana as taught by S. N. Goenka, and would like to take part in an anonymous online survey, please go to:
