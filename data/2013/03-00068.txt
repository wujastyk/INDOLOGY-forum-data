Dear List members,

I am trying to get a copy (preferably a scan) of the Citsabhe?otsavas?tra; the text is mentioned several times in David Smith?s ?The dance of ?iva?, and appears in its bibliography as follows:

Citsabhesotsavasutra, Cidambaraksetrasarvasva, vol. 11, Ed. Somasetu Diksita, Chidambaram, M.S. Trust, 1982.

I realize that it might be hard to locate this publication, let alone get a copy. I'd like to contact Dr. Smith, but I don't know his email address. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

With best regards,

Andrea
