=?utf-8?Q?[INDOLOGY]_Citsabhe=C5=9Botsavas=C5=ABtra?=
Dear List members,
I am trying to get a copy (preferably a scan) of the Citsabhe?otsavas?tra; the text is mentioned several times in David Smith?s ?The dance of ?iva?, and appears in its bibliography as follows:
Citsabhesotsavasutra, Cidambaraksetrasarvasva, vol. 11, Ed. Somasetu Diksita, Chidambaram, M.S. Trust, 1982.
I realize that it might be hard to locate this publication, let alone get a copy. I'd like to contact Dr. Smith, but I don't know his email address. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
With best regards,
Andrea
