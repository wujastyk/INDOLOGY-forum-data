Dear Friends and Colleagues,

I am happy to announce Vol. 14/1 of the *Journal of South Asia Women
Studies* http://asiatica.org/

In this issue:

Editorial Note: ?Inclusive Rights: On Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code
on Sexual Activities?, by Enrica Garzilli
Paper: ?Deconstructing Social Media in India?, by Alessandro Cisilin
Paper: "European Union and Empowerment of Women in Afghanistan: Issues
and Challenges?, by Sheetal Sharma

Summary of the Papers
  The paper ?Deconstructing Social Media in India? by Alessandro Cisilin
analyzes the role of social networks in India, debunking the myth of the
impact of the fast-growing IT sector on poverty reduction.   The paper
?European Union and Empowerment of Women in Afghanistan: Issues
and Challenges? by Sheetal Sharma attempts to delineate that empowerment of
women is important to make women active participant and stakeholder in the
process of reconstruction of war torn-Afghanistan, although the concept of
empowerment cannot be defined in abstraction and cannot be applied
universally.


Enjoy!

Dr Enrica Garzilli
Editor-in-Chief, JSAWS
