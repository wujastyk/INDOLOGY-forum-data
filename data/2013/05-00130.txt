[INDOLOGY] Sanskrit in Groningen
Dear Colleagues,
After a long uphill struggle, we have finally lost. The board of the 
Faculty of Religious Studies,  backed  by the Board of the University of
Groningen and supported by the chairman of my department, has decided to 
close the Institute of Indian Studies.
The tradition of the study of Sanskrit  of more than a hundred years  in 
the Groningen University,
which was inaugurated by Jacob Samuel Speyer,  will come to an end by 1 
August 2013.
I have little hope that protests will make any difference. If you feel 
inclined to react, though, this reaction could  be sent to the following 
addresses.
