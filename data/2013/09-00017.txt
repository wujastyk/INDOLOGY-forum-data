[INDOLOGY] request for an article
Dear Colleagues,
I am trying to locate the following article: Gombo, Ugen (1983), "Cultural Expressions of Social Stratification in traditiona Tibet: "Caste" and casteism in a non-Hindu context," Anthropology, Vol.7,  pp.43-77.
I cannot even locate the journal Anthropology, though not for want of looking.
If anyone could send me a PDF of this article it would be very much appreciated.
Cheers,
Greg Bailey
