Dear Colleagues,

I am trying to locate the following article: Gombo, Ugen (1983), "Cultural Expressions of Social Stratification in traditiona Tibet: "Caste" and casteism in a non-Hindu context," Anthropology, Vol.7,  pp.43-77.

I cannot even locate the journal Anthropology, though not for want of looking.

If anyone could send me a PDF of this article it would be very much appreciated.

Cheers,

Greg Bailey
