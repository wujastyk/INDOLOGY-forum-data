I am pleased to report the addition of an e-text of V?tsy?yana's
Ny?yabh??ya<http://sarit.indology.info/newphilo/navigate.pl?indologica.7>to
the SARIT online library.  The XML is also
downloadable <http://sarit.indology.info/downloads.shtml>, as usual.  I
expect the file will evolve in the future, with more corrections and
updates.  It is possible that a second, independent e-text of the same work
will be added to SARIT soon, and that will raise the interesting
possibility of file comparisons that I'll be exploring.
Best,
Dominik
