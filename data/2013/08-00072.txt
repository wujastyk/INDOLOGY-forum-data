For those who may be working on their first book manuscript, this is a reminder about the AIIS BOOK PRIZE:

In order to promote scholarship in South Asian Studies, the American Institute of Indian Studies (AIIS) announces the award of two prizes each year for the best unpublished book manuscript on an Indian subject, one in the humanities, ?The Edward Cameron Dimock, Jr. Prize in the Indian Humanities? and one in the social sciences,  ?The Joseph W. Elder Prize in the Indian Social Sciences?. Only junior scholars who have received the PhD within the last eight years (2005 and after)  are eligible. This must be the first book by the author.

A prize committee will determine the yearly winners, though the committee may choose not to award prizes for any year in which worthy submissions are lacking.  The prize will include a subvention of $2500 for the press publishing the manuscript. There is no designated press for publication. Authors are advised to submit their manuscript for publication at the most appropriate press; concurrent submission to multiple presses is recommended. Manuscripts under contract at the time of application are not eligible.

Unrevised dissertations are not accepted. Applicants must demonstrate they have revised the original dissertation.

Manuscripts are due October 1st, with an announcement of the awardees in the winter of 2013-14 . Send TWO copies of your manuscript, postmarked no later than October 1, 2013, to the Publications Committee Chair, Brian Hatcher, Dept of Religion, Tufts University, 314 Eaton Hall, Medford, MA 02144. Queries can be addressed tobrian.hatcher at tufts.edu.
