[INDOLOGY] Pingala Chanda Sutra publisher info
25 12 13
Dear Friend,
My 1840 ?aka that is 1917 edn too has a damaged title page. I recovered the
reading as
*siddh?ntas?mavedat?rthopan?makena*
*?r?s?t?n?thas?m?dhy?yibha???c?rye?a*
*samp?dtam*
This is guesswork as we do with damaged/illegible readings in old
manuscripts. The first word *siddh?nta *must have been the initial of the
institutionally awarded title. But I did not see anyone else using it. Hope
this helped.
Happy New Year Eve for all
Best
DB
