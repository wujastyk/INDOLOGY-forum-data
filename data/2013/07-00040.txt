Subject: [INDOLOGY] What's "Vedic"?

Dear Jarrod,
	I appreciate your project. Regarding your four heuristic historical periods, you place the Epics and earliest Puranas in the fourth period. Since many of those works are a m?lange of materials from many periods, some likely very old, is there a way to avoid anachronisms without drifting into circular use of dating evidence?
	I wish you success in this ambitious and valuable undertaking.
Best,
Howard Resnick

> I realize my use of "Vedic" is broader than usual (my dates are of course designed to break up the article into clear, manageable sections). Many sources want to end the "Vedic period" with roughly the 2nd Urbanization, which is equated with the Upanisads as "Ved?nta"/?ruti (see Example* below). The term "Ved?nta" is of course an emic concept that closes the "sacred canon" and hence "Vedic" is often synonymous with ?ruti. But the use of the term certainly doesn't end the production of extensive texts on Brahmanical values, customs, rituals, and ideologies/theologies. If "Vedic" is synonymous with "Brahmanical", then Smrti literature and the epics would be no less "Vedic" than ?ruti literature These issues become further complicated when we factor in a broad separation of early and late Upanisads, the composition of early and late ?rauta and Grhya literature, and include Bronkhorst's recent work, which throws a sizable wrench in the works (or spanner, depending on your current geography) as his argument would push some of the middle/classical Vedic period into my late Vedic period. (I also don't want to imply that Vedic texts and practices somehow disappear at 1 CE, because I no longer use the label "Vedic" in the above paragraph for the Common Era.)

And since I would rather pin my dates on someone else (always good to lay blame elsewhere), is there a recent "up-to-date" source that offers a reliable and/or reasonable insight into these issues, while designating some broad historical periods?
