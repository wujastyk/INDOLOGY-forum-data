[INDOLOGY] What's "Vedic"?
Dear Jarrod,
	I appreciate your project. Regarding your four heuristic historical periods, you place the Epics and earliest Puranas in the fourth period. Since many of those works are a m?lange of materials from many periods, some likely very old, is there a way to avoid anachronisms without drifting into circular use of dating evidence?
	I wish you success in this ambitious and valuable undertaking.
Best,
Howard Resnick
