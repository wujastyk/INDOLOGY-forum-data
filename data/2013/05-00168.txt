If I remember correctly, I obtained photographs of a manuscript of the
?aunak?ya Catur?dhy?yik? from the Chambers' Collection from
Staatsbibliothek Prussischer Kulturbesitz in Berlin.  This happened
probably some thirty years ago, but I am sure you can contact them to find
out about the current availability of manuscript-photographs.
