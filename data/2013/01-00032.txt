Phd thesis search
Dear Colleagues,
I would appreciate any assistance in locating a copy of Dr Stephen Glick's
PhD thesis from 1982 on the guru disciple relationship.
The title is 'An analysis of the change process in the guru-disciple
relationship'. So far I have only managed to find a sample copy of a few
pages.
Thanks.
Patrick McCartney
