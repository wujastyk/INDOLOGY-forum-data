[INDOLOGY] Mudda?
Many thanks to all who replied on or off the list to my query on 
mudda/mudd?. It seems fairly clear that the word as used in an 
astrological context is indeed an Arabic borrowing, although the 
compound mudda- or mudd?-da?? looks a bit tautological 
('period-period'). A meaning along the lines of 'modified, adapted' 
would have been more satisfying, as a mudd?-da?? is in fact a modified 
sort of da??; but usage isn't always as logical as one might like...
