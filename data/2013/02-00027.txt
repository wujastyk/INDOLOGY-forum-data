Jha's translation, also published in GOS, is definitely a translation of the GOS edition of text and commentary.

The translation is available as a pdf:

I believe that Jha's translation of the Tattvasa?graha was based on the GOS edition of the text, or is there an older edition of the Sanskrit text?
