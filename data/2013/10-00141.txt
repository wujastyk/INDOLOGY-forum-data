=?utf-8?Q?Re:_[INDOLOGY]_Pata=C3=B1jali's_syntax?=
In re this message of Andrew's, I differ strongly on the middle bullet point below (scroll down).  I tracked this carefully a number of years ago, and though I don't have hard numbers, I would say that the inverse is the case at least 90%  of the time or more: vai marks the predicate in a nominal sentence, i.e., X vai Y = Y is X.
e.g., u?? v? a?vasya medhyasya ?ira? B?U 1.1.1
The head of the sacrificial horse, clearly, is the dawn.  (Olivelle tr.; Hume got it backwards!)
That the horse and not the dawn is the topic becomes clear further on in the passage, where the syntax shifts:
yad vij?mbhate tad vidyotate?
When it yawns, lightning flashes...
I don't have time to multiply examples, but if checked it will bear out.
In the case of the construction under discussion, it seems to me that the formula "etad- yad Y" is simply an idiomatic expansion of "Y" marked as topic.
So Prof. Bhattacharya's rendering of mleccho ha v? e?a yad apa?abda? ("For a corrupt word is indeed a barbarian") gets things in the right order (as well as capturing the sense of the statement as a whole).

Dear Adriano,
I am by no means an expert, but I would agree with Dr. Hock about "invariable yat" (discussed by Gonda in Lingua 4:1ff.) for the following reasons:
  *   I take "ha" to be a causal particle (= yasm?t, hence yat != yasm?t);
  *   I take "vai" to mark the topic of the sentence (usually equivalent to the subject: in most nominal sentences, the subject comes AFTER the predicate, i.e., X Y should be translated as "Y is X," but X-vai Y should usually be translated as "X is Y");
  *   hence "for this mleccha (viz., 'mleccha' in the prohibition "na mlecchitavai") in fact means (yat) 'a bad word'"
