[INDOLOGY] was "Question for European Indologists"
Is the French /Manuel de grammaire ?l?mentaire de la langue sanskrite 
/to which reference has been made that which I translated from Gonda's 
original German (full title: /suivi d'exercices, de morceaux choisis et 
d'un lexique/, Brill, 1966, translator named on the back of the title 
page)?  I would be delighted to know that it is still in use.  I would 
also be interested to know when readings in devana-gari- are introduced 
in current classes.  When I was a student in Brussels, the introductory 
course in Sanskrit was an "option" course set up for students in Greek 
and Latin classics who were interested in comparative lndo-European 
linguistics, and it was taught in transliteration for their (our) 
benefit.  For those who, like me, developed a passion for Sanskrit and 
wished to pursue it further, devana-gari- was introduced as of the 
second year and then used exclusively.  Is this still a common 
situation, or is Sanskrit now primarily taught for its own sake, with 
readings in devana-gari- right from the start?
