Subject: [INDOLOGY] Question about death of Shalya in Mbh

Dear colleagues

Our respected Javanist Professor George Quinn posed this question about the javelin that killed Shalya. Can anyone help with this?

Please reply to George.Quinn at anu.edu.au

Thanks in advance

Dear McComas, Do you know off-hand whether a mantra or sacred weapon or sacred book called "Kali Maha Usadhha" or "Kalimahosaddha" appears anywhere in the Indian Mahabharata. In Javanese tradition it is a powerful, sacred book possessed by Yudhistira which, in characteristic Javanese fashion, turns into an irresistible javelin used by Yudhistira to kill King Salya towards the end of the great war.
Is this sacred heirloom/weapon a purely Javanese invention, or does it appear in the Indian Mahabharata?
With thanks.
Yours, George
