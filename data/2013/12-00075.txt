Dear colleagues,

Would anybody have a pdf scan of the following work? I could only find the 1905 Report. The 1901 Report is not available anywhere here in Japan and I have searched through archive.org, hathitrust.org and Wujastik's mss catalogue site but to no avail.

Shastri, Haraprasad. Report on the Search for Sanskrit Manuscripts (1895-1900). Calcutta: Asiatic soc. of Bengal, 1901.

The work appears to have only 25pp. So it should be light enough to send through private email. 

Many thanks in advance and best wishes for the festive season,
