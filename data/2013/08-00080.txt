Dear Herman,

Whitney certainly served as the first?stop reference grammar in
the European contexts that I have worked in (in Germany, England
and Denmark). Wackernagel is just to bulky and expensive (and of
course incomplete) to always have by one?s side. And even in
Germany, the English original of Whitney?s second edition (1889),
readily available in Indian reprints, is the version commonly used
(rather than the German translation of the first edition).

All best,
Stefan
