[INDOLOGY] Fwd: metre help - timely.
Dear list members,
I am having quite a bit of trouble identifying the metre of a dhy?na-?loka
of ??rad?. It's mystifying me, but then I am not an expert in metrics. At
23 syllables per hemistich, I assume it must be a J?ti-type metre (measured
in m?tras), but I can't seem to identify it. Here is the verse and the
scansion, any help would be much appreciated!
