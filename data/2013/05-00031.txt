Dear list members,

I am having quite a bit of trouble identifying the metre of a dhy?na-?loka
of ??rad?. It's mystifying me, but then I am not an expert in metrics. At
23 syllables per hemistich, I assume it must be a J?ti-type metre (measured
in m?tras), but I can't seem to identify it. Here is the verse and the
scansion, any help would be much appreciated!

?aktic?pa?aragha??ik?sudh?p?tra-ratna-kala?opalasat-kar?? <|>
p?r?acandra-vadan?? trilocan?? ??rad?? namata sarvasiddhiprad?m ||

- u - u u u - u - u - - u - u u u - u u - u -
- u - u u u - u - u - - u - u u u - u - u u -

u = laghu
-  = guru

best,
