Viiraka is Nandin/Nandirudra in Jayadratha's Haracaritacintaama.ni (chapter 4). He practices tapas and is then appointed as the first among the ga.nas (pramathaprathama) by "Siva. (The story is longer than this and contains a lot of details of Kashmirian holy places etc)He does not seem to be identified with Ga.ne"sa or Skanda (but is also called "son" by "Siva), nor is he a form of "Siva, although he is given a "Siva-like form by the god (verses 74-75): he becomes a four-faced Rudra with a trident, a bull to ride, a tiger skin to wear etcI hope this helps.
