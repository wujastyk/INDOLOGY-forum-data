[INDOLOGY] Digital Library of India
Thanks for this, Michael.  It might have been very useful. However, as 
often happens, immediately after posting to the list, I managed to get 
the downloading to work in dli-downloader. Later on with help from the 
author I could get the search function to work too. Now it works fine.
This is  a much easier method, I think. Dli-downloader copies the index 
of the DLI to one's harddisk. So one can search even without a 
connexion. Then a simple click selects and downloads to one's harddisk. 
It is automatically converted to a pdf of the text. Downloads are queued 
and resumed as necessary.
