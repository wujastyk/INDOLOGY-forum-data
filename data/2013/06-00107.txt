[INDOLOGY] Milk ocean
I believe khir is Skt kshira (I haven't figured out how to do diacriticals on Indology yet).
Other examples of Bengali simplifying Sanskrit consonant clusters, specifically ksh to kh:
Parikshit -- Parikhit
Kshetra -- Khetra
Bengali also sometimes simplifies Skt consonant clusters by adding a vowel:  bhakta -- bhakata
Best,
Howard
