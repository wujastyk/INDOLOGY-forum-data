[INDOLOGY] Hoernle epigraphical note
The entire issue is available here:
http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=njp.32101077790234;seq=9;view=1up
either page by page or (with partner log-in) as a whole
Archive.org has many other issues of this journal, though for many of them
the volume number and/or year is not mentioned (as usual).  I could not
find this particular volume (the one listed as vol. 69, 1900, is Part II:
Natural History).
