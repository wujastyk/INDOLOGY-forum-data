[INDOLOGY] Sanskrit syntax
Dear Chris and others,
  I do not know if Speier/Speyer/Speijer's _Sanskrit Syntax_ has been re-typeset or not, but there are publications for sale that give the impression of a new edition.  I discovered this when attempting to purchase a copy a couple of years ago only to discover that some "enterprising" individuals have been data mining Google books (and/or possibly the DLI) and selling exceptionally poor copies (missing pages, underlining, margin notes, etc.) of many books (including Speijer's) through a print-on-demand service as "new books". Just a warning to beware.
  I can say that the 2009 paperback from Motilal is very clean and readable.
best,
