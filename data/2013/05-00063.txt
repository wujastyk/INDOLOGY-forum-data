[INDOLOGY] Brill acquires the Forsten Indology list
I would like to simply thank Dominik Wujastyk and the other grand scholars
who raised and answered such vital questions of scholarship. In things
Indological as in other areas, this conversation may well document a
context-sensitive reading of *tuta sub aegide Pallas* - as the agency of
other 'gods' is often palpable as well.
