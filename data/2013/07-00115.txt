[INDOLOGY] Prof. Shivaram Dattatray Joshi, 15-8-1926 - 29-7-2013
With sadness we learn of the demise of Prof. Shivaram Dattatray Joshi, who
has been for many decades, in the words of his friend, student and close
collaborator Dr. J.A.F. Roodbergen, ?*il maestro di color che sanno* in the
field of Sanskrit grammar.? He will live on, to use Brendan Gillon's terms,
in "his published work" and in "his erudite students" (who have become the
teachers of P??ini-students of my own generation).
A bibliography of his publications up to 1989 is found in:
*P??inian Studies - Prof. S.D. Joshi Felicitation Volume*
(ed. by Madhav M. Deshpande, Saroja Bhate)
Michigan: Univ. of Michigan, Center for South and Southeast Asian Studies,
1991.
The same publication contains a Preface by Prof. Madhav Deshpande with
further details about the life and career of Prof. S.D. Joshi (accomplished
*vy?kara??c?rya* before reaching the age of 20, ?discovered? by Prof.
D.H.H. Ingalls in the early 1950s, Ph.D. at Harvard Univ. in 1960).
After his 65th birthday, from 1991-2011, fourteen volumes on the A???dhy?y?
of P??ini appeared with the Sahitya Akademi in New Delhi.
Authors: S.D. Joshi and J.A.F. Roodbergen.
Vol. fifteen in the series, prepared by J.A.F. Roodbergen alone (and
dedicated to S.D. Joshi), appeared in Pune at the Vaidika Samshodhana
Mandala in 2011.
Other supplements to the 1991 list of publications (articles by him, by him
together with P. Kiparsky and by him together with J.A.F. Roodbergen) can
be found in the section ?References? in *A Dictionary of P??inian
Grammatical Terminology* (by J.A.F. Roodbergen),  Pune: Bhandarkar Oriental
Research Institute, 2008.

Grammatical Terminology? in *Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research

One of his last public speeches was probably his Keynote Address in January
2009 at the Third International Computational Linguistics Symposium in
Hyderabad (see ?Background of the A???dhy?y?? p. 1-5 in Sanskrit
