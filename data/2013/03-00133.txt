SUBJECT: [INDOLOGY] Silent witness 
Dear
List, 
I am seeking clarification of the term from yoga /vedanta known
as the
silent witness. 
In several modern yoga textbooks I have so far
found only a poor 
transliteration as sakshi dreer.
Could someone
please confirm whether it is actually sAkSin + indriya, or
something
else. 
I would also appreciate knowing in what texts it is mentioned.
Thanks 
Patrick McCartney
