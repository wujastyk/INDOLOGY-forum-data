SUBJECT: [INDOLOGY] Silent witness 

Dear
List, 

I am seeking clarification of the term from yoga /vedanta known
as the
silent witness. 

In several modern yoga textbooks I have so far
found only a poor 
transliteration as sakshi dreer.

Could someone
please confirm whether it is actually sAkSin + indriya, or
something
else. 

I would also appreciate knowing in what texts it is mentioned.


Thanks 

Patrick McCartney
