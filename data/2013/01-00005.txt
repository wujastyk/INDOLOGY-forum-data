Dear colleagues,
Could any of you take some pains to inform me of the availability of the book mentioned above.I came to know that? Dr Diwakar Acharya has edited it which was published by Nepal Research Centre,Kathmandu in 2006.I tried several times via e-mail but all in vain.
I would be highly grateful if any person could help me find it.
Regards,
sincerely
