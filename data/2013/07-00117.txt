[INDOLOGY] Prof. Shivaram Dattatray Joshi, 15-8-1926 - 29-7-2013
It is Prof. Joshi's works through which I was introduced to the
Mahabhashya, and also to the whole Paninian tradition, through the
printed material.
The first work which I read was the samarth-aahnika. He made all the
arguments on  asamartha compound and gamakatva
easy by providing a summary in a tabular form.
When we decided to hold the 3rd symposium on Sanskrit Computational
Linguistics at Hyderabad,  I could dare to invite him as a keynote
speaker.
I say 'I could dare' because at that time I did not know him
personally, never did I meet him before. I knew him only through his
works. And as he puts it, he was hesitating to accept the invitation,
but when he accepted the invitation, he was there for all the three
days, attended all the sessions, and also encouraged us to arrange
such events frequently.
His keynote speech is available at
http://sanskrit.uohyd.ernet.in/Symposium/papers/joshi.pdf, and the
video at http://sanskrit.uohyd.ernet.in/Symposium/video/15-01-09/inau_keynote.rm
May his soul rest in peace, and may his wife have a strength to accept the loss.
