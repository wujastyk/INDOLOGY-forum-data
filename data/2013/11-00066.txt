[INDOLOGY] Lamentations
  Dear Charlie & All,
I have addressed this tradition of feminine lamentation in the MBh., in 'Stri:
Women in Epic Mahabharata', p.183ff. (HUP, 2009; and Orient Longman, 2011).

Margaret Alexiou has covered the cognate Hellenic field in her study of 'Ritual
Lament in the Greek Tradition' (1974).
With best wishes, from,
  Kevin.
