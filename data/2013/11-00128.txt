[INDOLOGY] query: 18 ;"sre.nii jaatis
Thanks, Rajam, for giving a link to my article.  I hope people will read it and consider it ? perhaps so much controversy can stimulate some more research.  As for the article, I really don?t think it says anything that is not generally known by anthropologists who study South India.  I was recently speaking to a social worker in Haryana (an Indian, not a westerner) who was perplexed that women who had given birth are severely segregated and are not given access to medical care because of superstitious beliefs (flow of blood).  She said sometimes these women die, and that it very difficult to change the villagers? mentality and overcome their very strongly held beliefs.  The customs regarding widows are well-known, and suttee is mentioned in Sangam literature. It is my contention that unenlightened beliefs that result in the exploitation and mistreatment of women and others need to be understood if there is to be any chance of changing those beliefs and the conduct they result in.  Unfortunately, this is very difficult, not only in India but elsewhere.  Belief systems can be quite toxic for people caught up in them.  There are endless examples of this all over the world, including the US.
