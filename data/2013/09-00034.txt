[INDOLOGY] Theravada Civilizations Project dissertation workshop
I am forwarding the following message to the list at the request of my 
colleague, Professor Steven Collins:
*The Theravada Civilizations Project announces:*
A Dissertation Workshop
To be held at University of Pennsylvania, March 25, 2014
/DEADLINE for proposals: January 1^st , 2014. /
The /Theravada Civilizations Project/ is pleased to announce plans for 
an intensive dissertation workshop, which will be held on March 25 2014 
in Philadelphia (preceding the Association for Asian Studies Annual 
Meeting).//
Theravada Buddhism is practiced throughout the world with over 150 
million practitioners settled primarily in Cambodia, Laos, Sri Lanka, 
Burma, Nepal, and Thailand. The South and Southeast Asian diaspora 
communities as well as the rise in global interest in vipassana 
meditation has led to the growth of Theravada Buddhism in the Americas, 
Australia, Japan, and Europe. The scholarly study of Theravada Buddhism 
began with the scrutiny of Pali literature, but now covers many 
disciplines including literature, ethics, anthropology, philology, 
philosophy, history, cultural studies, political science, urban studies, 
and art and material culture.
The/Theravada Civilizations Project/ is comprised of scholars from 
Arizona State University,Bowdoin College, the University of Chicago, 
Cornell University, the ?cole Fran?aise d?Extr?me-Orient, Harvard 
University, the University of Leeds, the University of London,the 
University of Louisville, Missouri State University, the University of 
Pennsylvania, the University of Toronto, the University of Vermont, the 
University of Washington and the University of Wisconsin, and in 
consultation with scholars from a range of other Asian, Australian, and 
European institutions.Adescription of the larger project can be found in 
Juliane Schober and Steven Collins, ?The Therav?da Civilizations 
Project: future directions in the study of Buddhism in Southeast Asia,? 
in the (on-line) Journal/Contemporary Buddhism/, vol. 13 (1), May 2012. 
Since project members and other scholars in the field are based at many 
different locations, graduate students preparing their dissertations do 
not have the opportunity to present and gain detailed feedback on their 
work from several experts in the field.
