[INDOLOGY] Silent witness
Dear List,
I am seeking clarification of the term from yoga /vedanta  known as the
silent witness.
In several modern yoga textbooks I  have so far found only a poor
transliteration as sakshi dreer.
Could someone please confirm whether it is actually sAkSin + indriya, or
something else.
I would also appreciate knowing in what texts it is mentioned.
Thanks
Patrick McCartney
