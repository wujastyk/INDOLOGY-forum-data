[INDOLOGY] Devanagari keyboard
In agreement with Patrick's note on Mac Devanagari, I forgot to mention
that I've also been using the Devanagari QWERTY in Pages; haven't gotten it
to work in Word either.
One can of course always type into a Gmail letter using the Devanagari
keyboard, which also uses the 'f' key for vir?ma's. In this method the
conjunct consonants come out nicely.  One can then copy and paste the text
in MS-Word.  Keep the keyboard set to Devanagari QWERTY, and type one
letter into the word document, e.g. ?.  Then put the cursor immediately
after the ?, and use the Edit, Paste and match formatting.  This will take
in your Devanagari into Word on the Mac.  The problem is that Word 'undoes'
the conjuncts and turns, for example, ?????? into something like ??? ?? ??
?, at least with Devanagri Samgam MN as the font.  Might someone know of
another font that would keep the conjuncts?
Cheers
