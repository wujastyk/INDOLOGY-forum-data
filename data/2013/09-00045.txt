Many years ago (1980s), David Allport did an MA thesis on the Bhuvanad?paka
at Oxford.  He did a critical edition of the text based on MSS in the
Chandra Shum Shere collection, plus maybe some photocopies supplied by
David.  I imagine there's a copy of his work in the Bodleian.  His
introduction might give you some information about Si?hatilakas?ri's v?tti,
though I'm only guessing.
