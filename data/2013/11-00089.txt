I think it is important to point out that in Tamil Nadu, perhaps 3-4% of the population is ?twice-born,? that is Brahmin (since one cannot really find K?atriyas and Vai?yas) and that Namm??v?r was of a high caste (j?ti) that in influence, wealth and prestige was probably in many ways superior to the Brahmins.  It is true that the ?r?vai??ava Brahmins (Iyengars) consider Namm??v?r a ?udra (along with 96% of the rest of the population), but that does not keep them from regarding his works as the Tamil Vedas, in every way as holy and respected as the Sanskrit Vedas.
