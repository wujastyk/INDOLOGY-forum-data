Re: [INDOLOGY] painting on canvas?
I remember a few more instances See sakuntala 6th act for her picture on a board. But this will not do. You cannot depend on others and?have yourself to rummage particularly thru popular literature, also kautilya for writing on a canvas which i cannot quote at present. Kosambi (Introd. Ind Hist)?deals at length with that.??Perhaps the Panchatantra and the Jaatakas will help.

Re: [INDOLOGY] painting on canvas?
Thanks for all the replies. Dipak?s mention of the Mudr?r?k?asa is dated at the
4th century CE at the earliest. The word for cloth he mentions is the
same one I was interested in: pa?a.
Joseph pushes it a bit farther back to the first or second century CE,
although that?s still a bit later than what I was hoping for.
It may be I'll have to translate it only as 'cloth' and not 'canvas'.
Best,
Dean
