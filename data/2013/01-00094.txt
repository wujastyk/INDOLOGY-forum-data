Madhva / Mbh
Dear List,
Is anyone aware of any work done on Madhva's Mbh commentary the Mah?bh?ratat?tparyanir?aya? 
Anything published on the work may prove useful to me. An initial internet search suggests at least the publication of a 2007 edition, possibly with an English introduction. Apologies if I've overlooked an obvious publication before sending this email!
Thanks for any suggestions,
Best,
