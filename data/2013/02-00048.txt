[INDOLOGY] Joanna
Dear Joanna,
You are already on the new list, along with everyone else from the former
Liverpool list.  No need to do anything special.  Just send public INDOLOGY
messages to
   - indology at list.indology.info
from now on, instead of the former Liverpool address.  They will reach all
the same people.
Best,
Dominik
