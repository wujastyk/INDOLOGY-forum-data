Dear Jonathan,

"Prima facie" is a funny term for this! 

I always imagined that the best way to reproduce a manuscript would be for one person to read it, and the other person to write down what they hear.

All the best,

Subject: [INDOLOGY] scribal self-recitation while copying

dear Colleagues.

Recently I told a student that errors in transcription which appear prima facie to be due to oral recitation may well also stem from copying a written exemplar, since scribes are known to recite to themselves, as it were, when copying. I think/thought that this was well known, but she tells me that she's looked around and not found a discussion of this idea. I have no idea now where I learnt it (although i believe it to be true). Any references? 

thanks so much, jonathan
