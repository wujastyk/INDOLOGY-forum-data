Anek?ntav?da, The Central Philosophy of ?j?vikism

*Author*: Johannes Bronkhorst
*Year*: 2013
International Journal of Jaina Studies (Online) Vol. 9, No. 1 (2013) 1-11
Abstract

?j?vikism, a vanished Indian religion, has been admirably studied by A. L.
Basham in his 1951 monograph. Since then, a renewed study of the existing
evidence has led to an improved understanding of this religion. New
evidence, moreover, has shown that this religion remained intellectually
active and influential at least until the end of the first millennium CE.
This paper will discuss other evidence again, also from the end of the
first millennium, which appears to show that ?j?vikism shared the
*anek?ntav?da* with Jainism, but not only that. Like Jainism, it used the
*anek?ntav?da* to solve a problem that did not arise until many centuries
after the time of Mah?v?ra. It follows that Jainism and ?j?vikism remained
closely in close contact with each other for at least half a millennium
since their beginning, perhaps longer, and shared some crucial intellectual
developments.

Neglected ?vet?mbara Narrative Collection, Hemacandras?ri Maladh?rin's
Upade?am?l?svopaj?av?tti Part 1 (With an Appendix on the Funeral of
Abhayadevas?ri Maladh?rin)

*Author*: Paul Dundas
*Year*: 2013
International Journal of Jaina Studies (Online) Vol. 9, No. 2 (2013) 1-47
Abstract

The ?vet?mbara teacher Hemacandra Maladh?rin (eleventh-twelfth century) is
often confused with his near contemporary Hemacandra Kalik?lasarvaj?a. This
paper analyses the sources describing his life and works and goes on to
focus upon his Prakrit verse collection, the *Upade?am?l?*, and his
autocommentary, the *Pu?pam?l?*. Seventy narratives from the *Pu?pam?l?* are
discussed (fifty-eight with identifiable sources, twelve with unidentified
sources). An appendix provides text and  annotated translation of
?r?candras?ri's account of the cremation of Hemacandra Maladh?rin's
teacher Abhayadevas?ri Maladh?rin, possibly the first eye-witness account
of a renunciant funeral in pre-modern India.

Localized
Literary History: Sub-text and Cultural Heritage in the ?mer ??strabha???r,
A Digambara Manuscript Repository in Jaipur

*Author*: Ulrich Timme Kragh
*Year*: 2013
International Journal of Jaina Studies (Online) Vol. 9, No. 3 (2013) 1-53
Abstract

The article critically discusses the underlying principles for the writing
of literary history. It rejects a universalized model and proposes a new
approach of "localized literary history" that is theoretically rooted in
metahistorical concepts of "textory" and "sub-text". The method takes its
starting point in local text-collections rather than national literature.
With the Jain *?mer ??strabha??h?r* repository in Jaipur as a point of
departure, it is demonstrated how a study of a local manuscript collection
reveals a literary history, which cannot be encountered by the
universalized approach.

One-Valued Logic for Non-One-Sidedness

*Author*: Fabien Schang
*Year*: 2013
International Journal of Jaina Studies (Online) Vol. 9, No. 4 (2013) 1-25
Abstract

The Jain *saptabha?g? *is well-known for its general stance of
non-one-sidedness. After a number of debates about the occurrence of
contradictory sentences inside the so-called "Jain logic", three main
theses are presented in the following: the *saptabha?g? *is a theory of
judgment giving an exhaustive list of possible statements; it is not a
"logic" in the modern sense of the word, given that no consequence relation
appears in it; the Jain *saptabha?g? *can be viewed as a dual of the
Madhyamaka *catu?ko?i*, where four possible statements are equally denied. A
formal semantics is proposed to account for these theses, namely: a
Question-Answer Semantics, in which a basic question-answer game makes
sense of every statement with the help of structured logical values. Some
new light will be also thrown upon the controversial notion of *avaktavyam*:
instead of being taken as a case of true contradiction, our semantics will
justify a reduction of the Jain theory of non-one-sidedness to a one-valued
system of question-answer games.

Perfect Body of the Jina and His Imperfect Image

*Author*: Phyllis Granoff
*Year*: 2013
International Journal of Jaina Studies (Online) Vol. 9, No. 5 (2013) 1-21
Abstract

The *Yuktiprabodha* of the ?vet?mbara monk Meghavijaya engages the views of
B???ras?d?s and the adhy?tma movement on a number of issues.  This paper
explores their debate about whether or not it was appropriate to adorn
images of the Jina. B???ras?d?s argued emphatically that adorning the image
did violence to the Jina, who as a renunciant had abandoned all forms of
adornment.  Meghavijaya argued that it was only by adorning the Jina image
that a sense of the Jina?s extraordinary beauty and radiance could be
conveyed. In the course of the debate Meghavijaya raises far-reaching
questions about how images function and how they are actually ?seen? by
worshippers.

Ratnacandra?s Nine Jain Questions for Christians

*Author*: Peter Friedlander
*Year*: 2013
International Journal of Jaina Studies (Online) Vol. 9, No. 6 (2013) 1-30
Abstract

This article examines a rare, and possibly unique, manuscript which
describes an encounter between Jain monks and Christian?s from an unknown
denomination of Padres which took place in 1854 at an unidentified location
either in R?jasth?n or the Pa?j?b or possibly in Agra. What makes this work
so interesting is that whilst there has been considerable scholarship on
the early stages of Buddhist-Christian and Hindu-Christian debates there
has been little work on encounters between Jains and Christians. The work
takes the form of nine questions posed by Muni Ratnacandra (1793-1864)
disciple of Muni Harj?mal (1783-1832) of the Manohard?s order of the
anti-iconic Sth?nakav?s? tradition. The questions which Christians should
be asked reveal unique features in how Jain tradition responded to
encounters with Christians. I argue that the main arguments deployed
against Christianity in the text are all adapted from earlier Jain
arguments deployed against other teachings. The importance of this text
then is that it allows us to have a unique insight into how Jain vernacular
tradition responded to Christianity during the mid 19th century.
