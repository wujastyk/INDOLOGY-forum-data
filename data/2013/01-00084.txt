I am trying to track down a text that is alluded to in a late eighteenth 
century essay by Henry Colebrooke as the ?Garland of Classes? 
(/Jaatimaala/). It is, in his words, a chapter of/Rudra-yaamala-tantra/.

It is not clear from what /Rudra-yaamala-tantra/ Colebrooke owned; a 
work by that name does not appear in his extant collection of 
manuscripts. Current scholarly consensus on the /Rudra-yaamala-tantra/ 
suggests that, though routinely cited as an important text in the Kaula 
Tantric tradition, the ?original? text is lost. There is a version of a 
text with the same name has been published in a Sanskrit edition by the 
Vacasampati Press, Calcutta. However, it does not contain a 
/Jaatimaala/chapter.

Can anybody shed light on the nature or whereabouts of this elusive chapter?


Many thanks

Laura Harrington
