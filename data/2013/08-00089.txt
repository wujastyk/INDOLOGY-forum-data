[INDOLOGY] Follow up to Lanman question
Dear colleagues,
Whitney was one of the five first Indological book (soon after Stenzler and Lanman) that I purchased more than 40 years ago and I still use it regularly. But of course, for grammar, not for language history. For this, Burrow, Gonda and many other books were already available. I still recommend Whitney to students as grammar ( with the warning that some of his ideas are antiquated).
Best,
Klaus
