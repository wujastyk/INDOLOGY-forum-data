Dear colleagues,
Whitney was one of the five first Indological book (soon after Stenzler and Lanman) that I purchased more than 40 years ago and I still use it regularly. But of course, for grammar, not for language history. For this, Burrow, Gonda and many other books were already available. I still recommend Whitney to students as grammar ( with the warning that some of his ideas are antiquated).

Best,
Klaus

Even the concept of the thematic stem was less developed than in Macdonell?s Vedic grammar. Whitney is more useful - I should say the best like every work by him - as a norm setting grammar than as a historical one. Macdonell?s is better but also outdated as it has no idea of the laryngeal.
> Burrow?s Sanskrit Language is more advanced and really looks fresh as he has accepted the laryngeal theory and some other ideas of Kurylowicz and even of Kuiper. But Burrow?s idea of the suffixal ?i- in, say, sthita is unacceptable. But he is not more faulty than the strongest upholders of the laryngeal theory.  In fact the common explanation of it (mainly from the Leiden school) as the replacement of a consonant is itself unsatisfactory and inconsistently upheld by some celebrities whom I need not name.   The contested idea of Schwebeablaut too will be found not disapproved by Burrow.
> I think that the outline can be best known from Burrow (1973), the details (excepting of the verb) from Wackernagel-Debrunner. For verb one should update Macdonell mainly with help from Hoffmann and Narten and partly Kuiper for his general conception, controversial and improved by Hoffmann, of morphophnology. I cannot tell about Werba whose work I could not collect. But there is a great desideratum, among many, in the study of adverbs, particularly the declensional ones.
