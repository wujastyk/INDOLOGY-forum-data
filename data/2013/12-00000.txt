[INDOLOGY] query: 18 ;"sre.nii jaatis
George, I agree about the evidence concerning sutteee and widow asceticism. But I don't agree about the stupid "magical" stuff about women's breasts and yucky menstruation! Gosh, I wish I had used those sacred magical powers when I was young and potent!!! Your writings make me feel as if the whole area of the Tamil land was impacted with dangerous power lurking every where! I wonder how any simple person would have lived there! Everything sounds like a "kuDukuDuppANdi" type of saying -- sacred magical power, death, blood, ... gory gory! 
Also, the analysis about "low-born" vs. "high-born" is debatable. You see, people like me who know this literature quite well are not fortunate enough to have the luxury of the time and financial resources that you and the drummers have in order to whip up an article in a few minutes! Some day I'll do it. Meantime, if people want to read my response to your theory on "aNangku" let them visit my website at: www.letsgrammar.org
Meantime, my request ... PLEASE, kindly, you (and your drummers) do not perpetuate the theory that women are "impure," some people are "low-born," ... so on and so forth. In my view as a brahmin, some of you are "low-born" and of "low-caste." Men are "impure" and even more dangerous than women for expelling that horrible white stuff called semen which makes a woman go through pregancay and enatiling horror!!Read me?
Thanks,
Rajam
