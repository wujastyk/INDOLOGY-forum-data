Problems with *devavandhy? *are several: Haplology involving -v- in the
Dravidian languages usually results in an elongated vowel (as *dev**?**ndhy?)
*or a double consonant as in  *d?va-vaca?am* > *t?vvaca?am *(????????).
Furthermore, *devavandhy? *doesn't explain the spelling variation of
*t**?vantikai
*and *t**?**vanti. *Most importantly, a barren woman of gods doesn't make
much sense semantically.
