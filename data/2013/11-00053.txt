 *s?vantika *is listed in Monier-Williams' Sanskrit-English Dictionary as
well as in Turner's
CDIAL<http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.4:1:884.soas>.


Problems with *devavandhy? *are several: Haplology involving -v- in the
Dravidian languages usually results in an elongated vowel (as *dev**?**ndhy?)
*or a double consonant as in  *d?va-vaca?am* > *t?vvaca?am *(????????).
Furthermore, *devavandhy? *doesn't explain the spelling variation of
*t**?vantikai
*and *t**?**vanti. *Most importantly, a barren woman of gods doesn't make
much sense semantically.

Suresh.
