[INDOLOGY] Query
In answer to Matthew's question, this has been done in Alexis Sanderson's
forthcoming book "?aivism and Br?hmanism".  A handout that outlines the
book's thesis is available on alexissanderson.com.
It's safe to say that the K?p?likas were beyond the pale (vedab?hyatara)
for all orthodox br?hma?as, but some authorities (e.g. Apar?ditya, as I
recall) rejected all initiated ?aivas as outside the Veda (vedab?hya) to
the same degree as the Buddhists. It is this (*inter alia*) that, to my
mind, makes the application of the term "Hinduism" impossible in the early
medieval period.
