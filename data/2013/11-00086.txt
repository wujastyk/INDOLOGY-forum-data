[INDOLOGY] EJVS 20-3 published
We are happy to announce another installment of the Electronical Journal of Vedic Studies, 
Vol. 20 (2013) Issue 3
Philologische Beitr?ge (1-3)
(Philological Contributions)
by
Marcos Albino
Summary:
Starting with the current publication, I propose	to begin a	series of contributions,in	which I will formulate observations on individual problems of Indo-European philology and linguistics.		
These papers probably would not amount	to ?regular? articles as I either plead for an earlier interpretation that	has been wrongly rejected or forgotten, or I discuss an	apparently wrong proposal, however	without being able to propose my own solution.
