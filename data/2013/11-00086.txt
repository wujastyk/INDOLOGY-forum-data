We are happy to announce another installment of the Electronical Journal of Vedic Studies, 
Vol. 20 (2013) Issue 3

Philologische Beitr?ge (1-3)

(Philological Contributions)

by

Marcos Albino

Summary:
Starting with the current publication, I propose	to begin a	series of contributions,in	which I will formulate observations on individual problems of Indo-European philology and linguistics.		
	
These papers probably would not amount	to ?regular? articles as I either plead for an earlier interpretation that	has been wrongly rejected or forgotten, or I discuss an	apparently wrong proposal, however	without being able to propose my own solution.
