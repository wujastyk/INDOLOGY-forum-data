[INDOLOGY] Calvert Watkins (13 March 1933 - 21 March 2013)
Dear Colleagues,
I have received from Craig Melchert the sad news that Calvert Watkins  
passed away in sleep on the 21st of March 2013 at home in Los Angeles.
We have lost a scholar of giant achievements in Indo-European studies  
and a gentle human being. Calvert Watkins took his Ph.D. in  
linguistics in 1959 at Harvard University, where he was long Professor  
of Indo-European Studies. In the following short bibliography I list  
his principal works and the 65th birthday Festschrift published by his  
students.
With regards, Asko Parpola
