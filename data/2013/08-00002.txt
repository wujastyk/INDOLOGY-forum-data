[INDOLOGY] Sacrificial Tortoise?
Dear George,
when I read such passages,
I feel it impossible not to wonder
whether the poet was ALSO expressing COMPASSION
for the tortoise,
given the fact that the human characters in the poem
are imaginary
(and therefore their suffering is unreal?
and we need not bother about it)
whereas we have to believe
that such CRUEL ACTS
as putting a tortoise in that position
must have been REALLY performed,
at least a few times.
