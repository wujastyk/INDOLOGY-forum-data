[INDOLOGY] vidhya?
Thanks a lot for all your quick responses!
Actually, I had come across spellings like "sathya" and thought that it might have something to do with Dravidian languages. Now I understand the logic behind it. What still puzzles me are examples from further North like:
Gujarat: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat_Vidhya_Sabha
Madhya Pradesh: Vidhya Sagar Secondary School in Bhopal (http://www.justdial.com/Bhopal/vidhya-sagar-higher-secondary-school-%3Cnear%3E-Bhanpur/0755P755STD71001_BZDET) etc.
But perhaps this is just the influence of South Indian transcription styles.
All the best,
Sven
