[INDOLOGY] Jodhpur RORI
Dear Dr. Delire,
Just to add to Professor Nemec's comments, which I second, having worked
there this past year: it is still not necessary to be affiliated to an
Indian university.  All of the collection has been scanned, but only half
of the scans are available; the rest are caught up in legal proceedings --
for those, you will have to request to see the originals, which is fairly
straightforward.
Nowadays, if a scan is available, you are first allowed to view the scans
on computer terminals, and only if you need to see the original will the
staff take it out.  Scans are available at a very reasonable rate.
However-- a colleague went there a few weeks ago and reported that the
viewing room, including the computer terminals, were closed as they remodel
parts of the building.  I would check with Kamal Sankhla, the very helpful
manager of operations, over the phone before heading there, in order to
save time.  I'm not sure how long the remodeling was supposed to go in.
In any case, the museum is full of beautiful manuscripts.
Best,
Tyler Williams
