[INDOLOGY] ?Citrak?vya
Dear list members,
I'm trying to help a friend who's looking for a solid bibliography on Citrak?vya. She's been finding it very hard to find, especially, good analysis and translations of the poems.
Does any one also know of editions of the texts quoted bellow with commentaries or glosses explaining the citra passages?
?i?up?lavadha, canto 19
kir?t?rju??ya, canto 15
j?nak?hara?a,?canto 18
Bellow she gives a list of the poems she worked on in her thesis (in which she also worked with greek and latin carmina figurata), many of which she couldn't understand fully well. If anyone could help us in finding any other bibliographic info on them, we'd be very grateful.
1. padmabandha - quoted in Jha (1975; 197)?
2. khadgabandha - Leela (1999: 61), Lienhard (1992: 211)
3. ?arabandha - Leela (1999: 63), ?Lienhard (1992: 212).
4. musalabandha - Leela (1999: 62).
5. ?akti - ?(Leela: 1999).
6. dhanus
7. hala
8. tri?ula - Leela ?(1999: 63)
9. murajabandha - ?(29th stanza of ??i?up?lavadha's ?canto 19 (Jha, 1975: 201); Leela (1999: 68).
10. chatrabandha - Jha (1975: 199)
11. cakrabandha -?-(one in ?i??p?lavadha's canto 19), another one quoted byLienhard (1992: 209) from Kum?rad?sa's J?nak?hara?a (18.148); a third one by??Jha (1975:. 198)?
13. turagapadabandha - Jha (1975: 196)
14. ??rayantrabandha - Jhaa (1975: 61)
15. sarvatobhadra - also form ?i?up?lavadha (19. 27).
16. gom?trik? - one j?nak?hara?a??(18. 21), another one from kir?t?rjun?ya (15. 12?)
The authors citing theses poems, she says, usually don't say where they got them from.
If any one may have digitized material that could send us, I thank him/her in advance.
