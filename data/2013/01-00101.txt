Subject: SARIT's flawless flow into philology /// Re: [INDOLOGY] SARIT              updates

SoRTing and inSeRTing my SeaRches, I'm indeed SuRprised to see how
SARIT is flawlessly flowing into my philology.

Congratulations and thanks for the efforts to lift the e-text from its
current grey status.

When the level of perfection is so high:
- at one place I saw "Rao" instead of "Rau" in connection with VP.
- I regret that words remain improperly joined following devanagari
consonant-vowel mergers as in uktaH and evamuktaH which need to be searched
separately (wildcards possible but leads to other problems: cp. evamuktaH
and compounds with -muktaH).
