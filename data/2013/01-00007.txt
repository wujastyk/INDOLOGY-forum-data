A highly interesting and thought-provoking paper. Thanks.

One remark, though. The Author skips "the discussion of judicial
ordeals" (p. 105); however, the inventory of judicial ordeals is not
limited to two types (fn. 3). It is much richer - and such ordeals,
especially those ending religious disputes would take on dramatic
forms (cf. Giovanii Verardi's "Hardships and Downfall of Buddhism in
India", Manohar, New Delhi 2011). In what way were they following the
ordeal "formats" described in the paper?

PS. I have always thought that only Slavic family names (such as
Szczesniakiewicz) would cause problems in remembering their
pronunciation and spelling. But - Francesco Brighenti's name?
