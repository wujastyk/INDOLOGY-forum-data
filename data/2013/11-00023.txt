On the three days December 5 (Thursday) to 7 (Saturday) of December 2013
we organize a

Symposium on the literary sources of the political history of the Kushans

at the Conference Center at the Seminaris Hotel, Berlin Dahlem
every day from 9 h until 17 or 18 h.
The event is organised by us, administrated by the Akademie der
Wissenschaften und der Literatur, Mainz, and sponsored by the German
Research Foundation and the Ernst-Waldschmidt-Stiftung, Berlin.
The sources are in Chinese, Bactrian, Indic and classical languages.
Their meaning, relevance and interconnection will be discussed by a

In addition, two papers a day will be read pertaining to recent
archaeological finds.

Interested visitors are welcome, but space is limited. So please
