Subject: [INDOLOGY] Dharmasastra quotation on upanayana

Balabhadra in his H?yanaratna quotes an unnamed text on the preferred 
time of upanayana. The MSS I have seen all give the quotation as:

a??avar?a? br?hma?am upan?yayet ?a??he ?nn?dyak?ma iti

The printed text cleans this up as follows:

a??ame var?e br?hma?am upanayet ?a??he ?nn?dyak?ma iti

-- but I don't know whether this corrected version exactly matches any 
actual text. Any help in placing the quotation would be much appreciated.
