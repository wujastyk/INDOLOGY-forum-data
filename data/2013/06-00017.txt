[INDOLOGY] Dharmasastra quotation on upanayana
Balabhadra in his H?yanaratna quotes an unnamed text on the preferred 
time of upanayana. The MSS I have seen all give the quotation as:
a??avar?a? br?hma?am upan?yayet ?a??he ?nn?dyak?ma iti
The printed text cleans this up as follows:
a??ame var?e br?hma?am upanayet ?a??he ?nn?dyak?ma iti
actual text. Any help in placing the quotation would be much appreciated.
