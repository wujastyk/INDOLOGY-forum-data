Thank you all very much for clarifying pa?a for me. The unanimous consensus, public and private, is for cloth of some kind (which is in line with the medieval dharma commentators), likely cotton or possibly silk.  It remains curious to me that not a single example seems to have survived, even very late, of a royal decree on such a cloth, but the evidence is overwhelming from the early observations of Nearchos, to the related terms in Indic and Dravidian, to the clear and surviving examples in ritual contexts.

Best regards, Don

Subject: Re: [INDOLOGY] Meaning of Pa?a?

It may not be entirely out of place to recall the significance of the pa?a in
the sacred arts of medieval Buddhism, and, I suppose, other religious
communities as well. I have written on this in


?Weaving the World: The Ritual Art of the Pa?a in P?la Buddhism and Its Legacy in Tibet?. In History of Religions 34/3 (1995), pp. 241-262.

My reason for bringing this up in this context is that so much of the emphasis in the materials I studied was on the pa?a, the canvas, itself, its ritualized production and sacred status. It
seems not likely that this was just forgotten in juridical contexts, and so it may have
been the case that a land-grant, edict, or contract written on a pa?a was in some sense sanctified, though here I am just speculating.
