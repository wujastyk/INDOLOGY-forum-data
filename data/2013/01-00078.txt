sharing a warning about a 'scholarly' scam
dear Colleagues,
I tried to copy my reply below to Indology from another email account, but
the settings of Indology let me post only from this account, so I copy it
here:

dear Sirs,
Since this is evidently nothing more than a money making operation designed
to extract profit from scholars, I manifestly refuse to be part of this
venture. Moreover, I will do my best to publicize this 'scam' to others in
the field who might not be aware of the 'business model' under which you
operate.

(I wonder if you even know who I am, since your mail did not even bother to
contain a salutation by name, or for that matter any salutation at all)

Journal of South Asian Studies is an open access peer-reviewed
international academic covering the study area of modern South Asia
pertaining to its politics, history, literature, arts, cultural and social
studies, economy and security matters, and international affairs with
linkage of immediate Asian regions. Articles on theoretical, comparative
studies and case studies, empirical analyses, commentaries and reviews
concerning the growing strategic significance of modern South Asian region
and its relevance with other Asian regions (Central Asia, Southeast Asia,
West Asia, and Middle East) are accepted for publication. Each issue of
South Asia gives an exclusive venue to ?Young dynamic social scientists?,
graduate and post-graduate students, researchers, practitioners and general
readers interested in South Asian politics. A special issue of the journal
is published in the background of important events or developments or
happenings in South Asian region or with collaboration of any world
region/country according to its respective countries? contexts.
As an editorial board member, I will expect you to encourage authors to
submit manuscripts for publication.  Although no minimum number of reviews
is suggested, I expect that there would be approximately 3-4 manuscripts to
review each year, which should take no more than 05-10 hours of your time.
 You will be expected to contribute to the quality of the journal, as well
as making suggestions about its contents and appearance. You will only be
required responding in electronic mail or by telephone regarding materials
sent to you to review. Any review that you perform would be anonymous to
the authors.
