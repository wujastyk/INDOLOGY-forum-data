[INDOLOGY] locating a scholar
Dear colleagues,
A colleague of mine here at McGill University is trying to locate
Dhanesh Jain, co-author with George Cardona of _The Indo-Aryan Languages_:
http://books.google.ca/books/about/The_Indo_Aryan_Languages.html?id=C9MPCd6mO6sC&redir_esc=y 
If someone has coordinates (email address or snail mail address), I 
would appreciate receiving it.
Thanks in advance,
Brendan Gillon
