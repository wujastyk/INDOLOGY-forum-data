We are pleased to announce the launch of a new international
journal, entitled *History of Science in South Asia*. HSSA publishes
high-quality academic research in the history of science, technology
and medicine, with a focus on South Asia.
The journal's founding editorial board consists of:
   - Dominik Wujastyk, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria
   - Kim Plofker, Union College, Schenectady, United States
   - Dhruv Raina, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, India
   - Sreeramula Rajeswara Sarma, formerly Aligarh Muslim
     University, D?sseldorf, Germany
   - Fabrizio Speziale, Universit? Sorbonne Nouvelle - CNRS,
     Paris, France
   - Michio Yano, Kyoto Sangyo University, Kyoto, Japan
You are warmly invited to submit research articles to the
journal.  Book publishers are invited to send copies of new
publications for review. See below for the submission guidelines.
For the journal's publishing model we have adopted the best and
most up-to-date codes of practice:
   - The journal is internationally *peer-reviewed* and indexed.
   - The journal is Open Access.  Articles can be *read at no charge*.
   - There will be *no article processing fee* for submissions made in
   the first two years of the journal's existence.
   - *Authors retain copyright* of their submissions.
   - Authors are required to publish their papers under a *Creative
   Commons license*, to facilitate wide dissemination.
   - Papers are published on the journal's website as soon as
   editorial tasks and typesetting are completed (rolling
   publication).
   - The journal is published *online and in print*.  Print issues and
   print
   subscriptions to the journal are sold on demand.
As you will see, the journal is free of charge both for readers and
authors. This is made possible through the generous support of the
publishers, the Sayahna Foundation (sayahna.org).  After two years,
any charges that may become necessary will be kept within
reasonable bounds; several innovative business models are under
active consideration, and it may continue to be possible to avoid
article processing fees.
Scope<http://hssa.sayahna.org/ojs/index.php/hssa/about/editorialPolicies#focusAndScope>
We take "South Asia" as an inclusive, non-political,
socio-geographic term referring to the area from Afghanistan to Sri
Lanka, from Pakistan to Bangladesh, and of course India. Research on
the influences of South Asian cultures beyond these borders is also
welcome, for example Nepalese or Tibetan influences on China, Sri
Lankan influences on the Maldives, or Indian influences in
South-East Asia.
We take "science" to be broadly conceived, and to include all forms
of rigorous intellectual activity that adopt at least to some extent
a quantitative and empirical approach, as in the German "Die
Wissenschaft," that covers most forms of academic scholarship.
Theoretical discussions of the meaning of the history of science
in the South Asian historical context are welcome. They should
presuppose some familiarity with topics such as those raised in
sources like Grant, A History of Natural Philosophy (2007), Latour,
Laboratory Life (1979), Staal, Concepts of Science in Europe and
Asia (1993), Shapin, "Science and the Modern World" (2007),
Netz, The Shaping of Deduction (2003, cf. review by
Latour), Pollock, "The Languages of Science in Early-Modern India"
(in Forms of Knowledge in Early Modern Asia, 2011), and similar
reflective works that explore Global History, the interpretation of
Modernities, and the general meaning of science in the pre-modern
world.
Submission guidelines
Factual articles reporting discoveries, or interpretative revisions,
are also welcome, as are editions and translations of science texts
in the languages South Asia.  Full submission guidelines are available
