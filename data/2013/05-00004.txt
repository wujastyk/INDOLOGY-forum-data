[INDOLOGY] Mudda?
No reason to mistrust Weber in this peculiar case. The word is clearly of Arabic origin; cf. also np. moddat.

This couldn't be a later Indo-Aryan form corresponding to Skt. mudr??

I should be very grateful if anyone could enlighten me as to the meaning and etymology of the North Indian word mudd?, as in mudd? da??, referring to a particular astrological division of a single year of life (employed in var?aphala or annual horoscopy). Clearly the word is not of Sanskrit origin, although it made its way into Sanskrit in early modern times. Monier-Williams and B?htlingk just refer to mudda (with short -a) as an astrological term, without commenting on its meaning; the source is apparently Weber's Indische Studien 2: 276, which gives two possible Arabic etymologies; but as Weber was notoriously unlucky in his etymological guesses, I would rather hear the opinions of knowledgeable list members.
