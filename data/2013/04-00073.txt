Does anyone out there have a scan of Schroeder's 1910 edition of the Kathaka Samhita  (book III, with the section on the Asvamedha)? Our interlibrary loan department, for some reason cannot get it.

While I am at it, I also have been unable to get a hold of the Srauta sutras of the Bharadvajas, so if anyone has a PDF of those, I would love to take a peek at them as well. 
Best,
