Dear List,


It was with great sorrow that we heard of the death of Prof. Mudumby Narasimhachary. Prof. Narasimhachary was Founder Professor & Head of the Department of Vaishnavism, University of Madras and a scholar published widely on Visistadvaita.

Oxford Center for Hindu Studies Facebook page has a post on this sad news.

Here is a brief account of him

He will be seriously missed by all at Oxford where he was Shivdasani Visiting Fellow (twice, most recently last year) and Director of Academic Affairs (2000?2001) at OCHS.
