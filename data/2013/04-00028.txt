Subject: [INDOLOGY] Bhattacharyya's Sadhanamala edition

The Oriental Institute, Baroda, recently reissued the two-volume S?dhanam?l? edition. It is listed as a "third edition (Reprint) 2009" (vol. 2, 2011). It is a good, clear copy on nice paper, well-bound, for Rs. 625 for the set.

I have a copy that I am quite happy with, that I word search "old-school." I would encourage supporting the Oriental Institute by purchasing a print copy from them, if one can. The reprint edition reads (for what it's worth) "? All rights are reserved by the Publishers."

Since there is a substantial introduction to volume two, it may not be (entirely) covered by the "critical edition" policy.

Best,

Christian

So his copyright expires and his works become public domain in 2024, 60 years after his death (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries%27_copyright_length.  The (C) rules specifically within Indian borders are laid out here, and seem more relaxed than the various international legislations (to which India is also a signatory): http://copyright.gov.in/Documents/handbook.html.

This is law in Germany (but may be reviewed soon), and is emerging as general usage elsewhere.  So if the Sadhanamala vols are just edition,  or we're talking about scans of just the edition parts, then they've been in the public domain since 1985.
