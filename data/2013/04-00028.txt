[INDOLOGY] Bhattacharyya's Sadhanamala edition
The Oriental Institute, Baroda, recently reissued the two-volume S?dhanam?l? edition. It is listed as a "third edition (Reprint) 2009" (vol. 2, 2011). It is a good, clear copy on nice paper, well-bound, for Rs. 625 for the set.
I have a copy that I am quite happy with, that I word search "old-school." I would encourage supporting the Oriental Institute by purchasing a print copy from them, if one can. The reprint edition reads (for what it's worth) "? All rights are reserved by the Publishers."
Since there is a substantial introduction to volume two, it may not be (entirely) covered by the "critical edition" policy.
Best,
Christian
