Dear List,

I forward the following announcement on behalf of Dilbahar Singh:

*Announcement: Hindi Dictionary app with Awadhi, Brajbhasha, Khariboli and
Urdu Vocabulary for iPhone and Android*

Academic Room Hindi
Dictionary<http://www.academicroom.com/blogs/post/hindi-dictionary-app-developed-academic-room-harvard-innovation-lab-supports-ios-android-and-blackberry>
is
a Hindi to English dictionary app developed in the Harvard Innovation Lab.
Its massive database provides over 350,000 definitions. The dictionary is
designed with students and scholars in mind, to help them translate words
and idioms from modern Hindi, Urdu, Khariboli, Brajbhasha and Avadhi. All
words can be searched using a Devanagari keyboard. The dictionary app works
on iPhone, iPad, Android and Blackberry mobile platforms.

of lugging around huge Hindi dictionaries is finally over."
