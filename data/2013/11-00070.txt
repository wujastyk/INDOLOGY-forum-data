[INDOLOGY] Lamentations
In the Tamil tradition of South India ? 
1. "Lamentation" is a practice in families when a death occurs. This practice may vary from family to family. As a brahmin, I know of this practice being followed at least in the villages for ten days following a death. Village women gather at the home of the deceased and "lament" (== sing songs) the death. In some families it is practiced at least once a day (at dusk) or twice a day (at dawn and dusk). In some places, women are "hired" to do this, and these women are called "k?likku m?r a?ipp?r ('those who are hired for beating their chest')." A student of mine has done her Ph.D research on this topic, and she also sings those songs, which are called "opp?ri" during an annual festival of celeberating traditional literary genres or something like that. 
2. "Lamentation" is also a literary genre, where a woman laments the separation of her lover, as we see in Old Tamil literature. Basically it is nostalgia.
