[INDOLOGY] "vIraka"
Indeed, Nandirudra is not a bull in the Haracaritacintaama.ni, nor in a lot of places elsewhere. For a recent discussion in the Tantric context, see the entry Nandin in the 3rd volume of the T?ntrik?bhidh?nako

Re: [INDOLOGY] "vIraka"
If I understand Judit correctly, the Nandirudra which Jayaratha writes of is not half-bull half-man. Identification of Nandin as ?iva's bull is a recent phenomenon; in the pre-modern period, the bull vehicle was just called V??abha while Nandin/Nandirudra was a ga?a and one of ?iva's dv?rap?las.

Thanks to all of the Indological sleuths who responded to my query,

is astounding.
I should have mentioned that Kurma Purana 2.7.7 includes "vIrANAM
vIrabhadro 'haM." It therefore seems a little less likely to me that
"gaNeSAnAM ca vIrakaH" only three verses later at 2.7.10 would be a
repeated reference to Virabhadra. However, the identification of
Viraka with the half-bull, half-man form of Nandin, suggested by Drs.
Roebuck and T?rzs?k, makes a lot of sense.
Based on your responses, it also seems there is a dissertation waiting
to be written on the mythology and iconography of Nandin/Viraka. If
someone can point me to an article on Nandin that discusses this
humanoid form, I'd be grateful.
My annotated translation of the Isvara Gita (Kurma Purana 2.1-2.11),
including this verse about vIraka, will be available from SUNY Press
in 2014.
All the best,
Andrew
