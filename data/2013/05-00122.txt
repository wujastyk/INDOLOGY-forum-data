Perhaps this is not pan-Southasian. In my school days a Sikh batchmate 
asked me why Bengali fathers called their daughters or girls of their 
daughter's age 'Ma!' 
Calling a young woman 'Ma' is of course an 
honour as well as sign of responsibility of protection. This is 
characteristic of Bengali Muslims too. I have pleasant experience of 
that. Long ago travelling for a night in the Madras Mail I got an 
'Instant ticket'. An 'Instant ticket' at that time assured entry without
 the guarantee of a berth. A Muslim gentleman watched us checking from 
berth to berth and at last assured my daughter on his own, 'For mother 
there will be no problem of a berth'. To me he said, 'Why! Your daughter
 is not my daughter?' 
There is a famous story about Shvaji that a Muslim young woman was captured by his men and brought before him. Shivaji told her,
'If my mother were like you I would have been a handsome man.' That guaranteed protection.

This phenomenon is pan-South Asian. It is very common to address women as 'mother' 'maa/amma/aayi' and men as 'father' 'baapu, ayya, appa'. It is also common across linguistic families to address sons and daughters endearingly as 'mother' and 'father'.

Thank you, Matthew, for raising these key questions. Gaudiya [Bengali] Vaishnava communities, expanding around the world, typically follow and teach this "rule" of addressing women as 'mother.' ?Are they merely propagating a Bengali Hindu custom? Or does it include Bengali Muslims? Is the custom, to any degree, pan-Hindu? pan-South Asian?
