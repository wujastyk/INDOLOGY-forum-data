I'm a huge admirer of Speyer's book--I honestly feel like I learn something
new and interesting every single time I open it-- but I do agree with Chris
that it would benefit from re-setting.  The font in which the N?gar? text
is set can make for hard reading for those who aren't used to it: there are
many times that I've strongly recommended it to intermediate students who
have found it difficult to make sense of.  Also, Speyer doesn't always
translate his examples: this isn't a problem for those with more experience
in the language, but the target audience of language learners are sometimes
at a disadvantage, which is a real shame.
