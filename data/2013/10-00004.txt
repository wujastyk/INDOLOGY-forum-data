[INDOLOGY] Pataliputra & Patna
According to F. R. Allchin, it was James Rennell:  ?The ancient city was first identified with modern Patna by Rennell (1783)...? in Allchin, ed., The Archaeology of Early Historic South Asia, p. 200.  The reference is to Rennell?s Memoir of a Map of Hindoostan.

I am trying to determine how old the identification of the ancient P?taliputra with modern Patna (or roughly the area of modern Patna ) is. Who proposed it first and in which publication? Even leads based on memory may help.
