[INDOLOGY] INDOLOGY Digest, Vol 3, Issue 1
Dear Patrick,
Forgive me if I've missed something in this discussion thread, but
isn't it likely that "dreer" is simply draSTR? This word appears 4
times it Patanjali's Yoga Sutras (1.3, 2.17, 2.20, 4.23) and denotes
the "seer" or "witness" (usually identified in the secondary
literature with the Samkhya concept of puruSa).
If you want to explore this concept I'd recommend Edwin Bryant's
translation and modern commentary, or T.S. Rukmani's translation of
Patanjali that also includes translations of Vyasa's and
Vijnanabhiksu's commentaries.
Best,
Andrew
