Dear colleagues,
does anyone happen to have a pdf of Kane's edition of Kaadambarii 
Puurvabhaaga? The link on archive.org unfortunately leads to a pdf of 
the Uttarabhaaga. Apparently Kane's Puurvabhaaga was published in two 
parts, the first corresponding to pp. 1?124 of Petersen's ed., and the 
second to pp. 124?237 of the same. I am especially interested in the 
second one.
Many thanks,
