[INDOLOGY] Changing your INDOLOGY list options
If you want to switch to receiving INDOLOGY messages in digest form, or
change other settings to suit your needs, got to
   - http://list.indology.info
and scroll to the bottom.  The last line lets you put your own subscriber's
email address into the box, and then you can reach the place for tweaking
your options.  You'll need your password, but the option page also has a
button for reminding you of your password in case you have forgotten it.
