Dear all,
I am working on the full translation of the mathematical commentary
by Si?hatilakas?ri
(13th CE) on the
*Ga?itatilaka* by ?r?pati (11th CE).

. According to Pingree, Si?hatilakas?ri  wrote a v?tti at Vij?pur (Gujarat)
in 1269 on the jyoti?a-work *Bhuvanad?paka* by Padmaprabhas?ri.

 I wonder if anyone knows  whether such commentary has ever been published
or if it is possible to locate the manuscripts.

Thank you very much in advance,
 sincerely,
Alessandra.
