I have not read Stietencron?s thesis. So I do not know if
he referred to the older account of the community available in Nagendra Nath
Basu?s Vanger j?t?ya itih?s ?Caste history of Bengal?,
Br?hma?akha??a (=Vol.1).
Basu has other writings on them, in English too, but these require corrections
and are not dependable.

Re: [INDOLOGY] ??kadv?p?ya brahmans
I've discovered H. von Stietenkron's PhD, published in 1966, and Humbach's helpful review of it in the IIJ 12 (1969): 43-7.

Can anyone point me to some up-to-date information about ??kadv?p?ya brahmans?? What did it mean to a twelfth to seventeenth-century author to identify himself as belonging to a ??kadv?p?ya family?? Would such a family have retained cultural links to Central Asia and Eastern Iran, to Seistan?? I would have thought not.? But is there any scholarly exploration of this issue?
