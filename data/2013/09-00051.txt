This edition replaces the Gauri Shankar's editio princeps of 1937 and its reprint, both of which are out of print. The Sanskrit text is given in Devanagari. The edition is based on the oldest palm leaf manuscript from Nepal (11th century?) which allowed to correct many mistakes and fill the numerous gaps of the first edition.
