[INDOLOGY] Publication Announcement
Yes, but Gita's syncretism is almost fully inclusive, it appears to me. and
vague--no one is openly denied place, except for the "asuras". With
Sanatana and Jiva Goswamis, we see a worldview of progress towards Krishna
in which advaitins fit, though not high on the ladder, but not Buddhist,
Jains etc. This seems similar to what Vijnanabhiksu and Madhusudana were
doing, with the order reversed. Brihad-Bhagavatamrita does read like a
project of "Unifying Hinduism" if we have in view the milieu in which it
was written -- Jains were not gone, Muslims were the rulers, sometimes even
temple patrons, but they are not "on the way to Krishna". There is, in
other words, an attempt of delimiting the borders of the orthodox.
Kind regards
