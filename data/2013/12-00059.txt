[INDOLOGY] Publication Announcement
Just to add to the point. The designation Nastika shows up in the Pali canon, but it means something quite different from the usage Nicholson discusses. [Excellent discussion, btw.] The Nastika is one who denies the existence of karma and the efficacy of yajna and hotara, among other things. Under this categorization, "Hindus" and Buddhists would both be astikas and the lokayatas would be nastikas.  I am thinking the borderline between Buddhism and Hinduism was drawn (incompletely) around the time of the Puranas and didn't catch on everywhere. I think it likely that the distinction was still being solidified by the time of Vijnanabhiksu.

Re: [INDOLOGY] Publication Announcement
Dear Aleksandar and Howard,
Thanks for your interest in the topic of my book.
In the Puranas there is certainly plenty of vilification of certain
groups--Jainas, Bauddhas, Kapalikas, and Pasupatas among them. But in
first-millenium Puranas there is not yet any clear binary
classification of two groups of sects along astika/nastika or
Vedic/anti-Vedic lines. It seems the first clear expression of this
binary occurs in Krsnamisra's comedic play Prabodhacandrodaya (late
11th c.). By the 14th century, this way of classifying groups has
become the dominant discourse.
In the concluding chapter I offer some possibilities for how and why
this shift occurred. But no spoilers here--you'll have to buy the
book!
Best,
Andrew
