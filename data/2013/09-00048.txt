Dear Ales,
Unfortunately, after checking our lists in the Cambridge collections, I 
have to say that we have only one ms of the m?la, but no ms of the 
v?tti. Anyway, you find the information you need on p.254a of the sixth 
volume of the New Catalogus Catalogorum. On p. 508 of N. Balbir's 
catalogue of the Jain mss of the British Library, Cat. No. 1401a is 
listed as a ms of Si?hatilakas?ri's ??k?, which however seems to have 
disappeared (I was trying to find mss you could easily consult without 
having to travel).
I did not have time to check the VOHD, but I guess it's worth a try 
anyway.
