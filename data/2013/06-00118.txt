Dear List,
I have some files written using Devan?gari and Roman fonts almost three decades ago. Unfortunately, the font used for writing Devan?gar? is Ajmer that was perhaps used more than a couple of decades ago for writing Devan?gar? on Macintosh. As I open these files on my MacBook Pro (X 10.7.5) I am able to read the Roman script but not the Devan?gar? at all. I understand that the font Ajmer is not compatible with the present versions of Mac. Is there some way I can convert the Ajmer-Devan?gar? files into one of the modern Unicode Devan?gar? fonts ? Or is it that these files can only be read on version 9 of Mac ? Any help would be highly appreciated. Thanks very much in advance.
Yours,
Mrinal Kaul
