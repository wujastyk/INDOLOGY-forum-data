[INDOLOGY] Query on negation
dear All,
I too would be very curious to read this paper, especially since I had the
idea that the difference between the two forms of negation was rather that
one is implicative and the other not: there is no elephant in the room does
not imply that the elephant is waiting in the corridor, while this elephant
is not white does imply that he is another color. (Probably these are not
perfect examples, so apologies in advance for the imprecision, but I think
the point remains clear--or rather, the question!)
