is ti possible that anyone has a pdf of Malamoud's paper in English (not
the whole volume, although if you have it...)? A review of the volume I was
able to read online suggests that for the purposes I need this chapter is
best (and the person who asked me the question doesn't read French, and
frankly, since it already exists in English, I don't feel like translating
it again myself!)  thanks!!
