Dear all,

I wonder if anybody has access to a wider range of JSTOR journals than SOAS 
has and send me a copy of a paper ~ I'm trying to get an article from the 
Journal of Biblical Literature, but suprisingly SOAS do not seem to 
subscribe to that.

The item I am trying to get is:

J Massingberd Ford, "The Son of Man -  A Euphemism ?"

JBL 87 (1968) pp257-67 (I think this was in the 3rd quarter issue)

I would be grateful if anybody could help out.

Many thanks,
Stephen Hodge
