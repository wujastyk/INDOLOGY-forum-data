Dear Patrick,
Thanks for your two responses. The reading Dharmajavidhi makes things a bit easier; Dharmaj?avidhir would be even easier.
The mantra you cite must be emended to m? prag?ma patho vayam (if that is not actually what the edition gives). Lak?m?dhara's comment was at first sight puzzling to me. But now it seems to me his reasoning, or that of his source, must have been that this group of 5 mantras, in its ?gveda version (10.57), reads as p?da 5c j?va? vr?ta? sacemahi. The connection with j?vad?na seems forced.
The Divyatattva must be referring to the phrase p????ku?apu?? which indeed occurs repeatedly in the ??rad?tilaka. Indeed in some late Tantric texts, a third meaning of j?vad?na (that I don't understand yet) seems to be at play.
Best wishes,
Arlo

Dear Arlo:
In the commentary on this by Lak?m?dhara, Vyavah?rakalpataru (Dharmako?a, I: 523), we have: j?vad?n?dikai? "ma prag?m apathy vayam" ity?dibhi?. 
The Divyatattva comments: j?vadanamantras tu ??rad?y?m -- "p????ku?apu?? ..> *and a long explanation (too long for me to type it out here!!). The Divyatattva was edited and translated by Richard Lariviere (Manohar, 1981). This is a much more tantric rite.
Aiyangar's edition (I have a hard copy) does not add much to this; the Kyoto electronic copy is based on it.
Best,
Patrick

The B?haspatism?ti contains the interesting short text entitled Dharmakavidhi pasted below. If I am not overlooking anything, Kane has not discussed it in Hist. of Dharma??stra. Does anyhone happen to know parallels for it, does anybody have a suggestion on what the significance of the suffix -ka might be here, and is there any convincing way to estimate the date of this little text (presuming that the B?haspatism?ti is a composite text)? Could anyone supply a pdf of K.V. Rangaswami Aiyangar's volume Gaekwad Oriental Series, 85 (B?haspatism?ti Reconstructed, 1941)?
On a related note, I assume that j?vad?n?dibhir mantrai? here refers to the Vedic mantra j?vad?nava stha etc. So this passage is not directly relevant to my underlying problem, the meaning of j?vad?na in a 5th c. inscription: sources such the Ratnam?l?vad?na 4.112 and the Vi??udharmottarapur??a 1.93.10 seem to suggest that this can be an equivalent of jalad?na (itself, presumably, an equivalent of the Mah?d?na jaladhenu) or else that it literally means a gift of life (as at MBh 12.149.108 and, somewhat differently, at Brahm???apur??a  2.16.53). I should much appreciate references to or discussions of j?vad?na in the primary of and secondary literature on Dharma??stra.
Thank you.
