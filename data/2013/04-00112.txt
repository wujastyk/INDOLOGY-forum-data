Hello McComas,

     As far as P??ini's grammar is concerned, the only difference between
external sandhis and sandhis between members of a compound is that the
sandhi is seen as obligatory within a compound, but not outside a
compound.  Having said that, the members of a compound are treated within
P??ini's grammar as full pada-s or inflected words, where the inflections
simply get deleted, and new inflections added to the compound as a whole.
Therefore, the members of a compound as well as independent inflected words
of a sentence have the same status as pada-s, and hence the same sandhi
rules apply to them.  The practice of writing Avagraha is not seen
consistently in the manuscripts and printed texts and it is generally not
shown within a compound, but the actual sandhis are the same.  Best,

Madhav Deshpande
