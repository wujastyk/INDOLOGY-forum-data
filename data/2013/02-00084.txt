One person who would be very interesting to consult in this matter is Urs App, one of the most - if not the most - prominent specialist on the history of the discovery of South and East Asian thinking and literary works by Europeans. I don't know if Urs is on this list, but if he is, we would be pleased to have his expert opinion on the matter.
