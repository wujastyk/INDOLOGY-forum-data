[INDOLOGY] Help me please
Dear Indologits.
?I have two questions:
1. - Are there cases in Indian history, that the word prabhu had been used for holy women?
2. - What would be the optimal word in female gender of prabhu in Sanskrit and ?the other vernacular languages ??derived from this?
I will be so thanks for your help.
With my best wishes.

Asunto: Re: [INDOLOGY] mAtAjI
I have seen and translated this or similar verse, but cannot put my finger on it. The issue, however, is NOT about speaking about about "seeing"? -- that is regarding. In the verse I have seen the locatives are given as accusatives: m?t?vat parad?ra? ca etc. Also the last p?da, as I remember it runs: ya? pa?yati sa pa?yati -- one who sees (this way), truly sees.
