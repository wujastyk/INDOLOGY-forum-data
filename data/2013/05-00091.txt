[INDOLOGY] Query on negation
Thanks to Birgit for referencing my article. The upshot of the article is to argue that the distinction the two forms of negation identified by the grammatical tradition corresponds to what contemporary linguists would characterize as wide and narrow scope negation. The parsing of the compound as (a-dharma)-j~na gives the privative prefix narrow scope, while the parsing as a-(dharma-j~na) gives the privative prefix wide scope.
This ambiguity is exhibited by such English compounds as `un-button-ed'. An `unbuttoned shirt' may be either a shirt which one has never buttoned or shirt which had been buttoned but someone has undone the buttoning.
Such ambiguities are typically decided by context, as Madhav pointed out.
Best wishes,

Re: [INDOLOGY] Query on negation
If we are dealing with accented Sanskrit, then adharma+j?a would give us the ud?tta accent on the final syllable, while a+dharmaj?a would give us the initial ud?tta.  But in Sanskrit without accents, we have to rely on the context to make this distinction.  A good case may be adharmac?rin that I have seen in a few places, where it indeed means those who behave in unrighteous ways.
