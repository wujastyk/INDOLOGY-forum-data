well ... I don't really care what the belief systems are elsewhere now. currently, i'm only interested in those socio-anthro analyses of Old Tamil literature, which to me sound very stupid and illogical and highly extrapolated not adhering to the litearture. i wonder how many of those socio-anthro folks really knew to read/write/understand Tamil, especially OLd Tamil literature! in fact, in my view, Sanskritists do a very good job -- of actually learning the language and grammar! s.indian analysts rely heavily on the dictionaries! ;-)
