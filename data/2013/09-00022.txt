[INDOLOGY] Who is Sumati
In *New Dimensions in Jaina Logic*, English rendering by Natmal Tatia  
of Yuvacarya Mahaprajna?s "Jaina Nyaya ka Vikasa", Ladnun: Jaina  
Vishva Bharati, 1984, p. 174, the entry reads:
"Sumati (8th-9th century A.D.)
V?dir?jas?ri has made a mention of his _Sanmatitarka??k?_ in the  
_P?r?van?thacarita_ written by himself. There is a mention of his  
_Sumatisaptaka_ in the eulogy of Malli?e?a".
The Jaina Siddh?nta Ko?a does not seem to have anything on this philosopher.
Hope this helps.
