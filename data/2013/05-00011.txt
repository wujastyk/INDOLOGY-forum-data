[INDOLOGY] New Catalogus Catalogorum
I'm delighted to have received the latest five volumes of the NCC, vols.
20-25.

Here is the useful table of volume contents that is now printed on the back
of each volume.

I always find these vols. hard to get.  In this case, a friend in Madras
bought them for me at the University of Madras Publications Office, and
personally mailed them to me.  I have found that MLBD is usually not able
to supply them, for some unknown reason.
Best,
Dominik
