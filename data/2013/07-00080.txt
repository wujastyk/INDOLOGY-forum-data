[INDOLOGY] Indology in Bologna 1900-1903 AD (and Paul-Emile	Dumont)
Thanks, Svevo.
I knew that he was a senator, but the link you gave was new to me. Perhaps I could have found the correct dates also from Franci's books, but they are at home and I am writing from my office. I visited Bologna myself 11 years ago giving a few lectures and had very nice time with Franci, Passi and Marchignoli.
Best,
Klaus
