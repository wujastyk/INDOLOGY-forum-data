Dear Mrinal,
I understand 'ch?y?puru?a' to mean just what it sounds like: the shadow person.  Numerous tantric and tantric-derived texts discuss prognostications based on watching subtle changes in one's shadow on a clear and sunny day.  The IFP's paper transcripts include a ch?y?puru?alak?a?a (#T0620), which is available from Muktabodha's portal and might be helpful.  Consider also this clear passage from the Yogam?rgaprak??ik? of Yugalad?sa (typed by P?ter-D?niel Sz?nt?):
	[atha ch?y?puru?asya vidh?nam] 
?uddh?tape svadehasya pratibimba? vilokayet | 
bh?mau d???v? tath? khe ca prat?kop?san?? caret || 9 ||
yog? samabhyasen nitya? svaprat?ka? yath?vidhi | 
tena vij??yate sarva? l?bh?l?bhau bhav?bhavau || 10 ||
?ira? chinna? tath? kampas tad? m?tyur bhaved dhruvam | 
yad? na d??yate b?hur bhr?t?h?nis tu j?yate || 11 ||
samast?ni ca hy a?g?ni svaprat?kena pa?yati | 
tat sarva? ca vij?n?y?t tasya h?nir na sa??aya? || 12 ||
ya? karoti sad?bhy?sa? gupt?c?re?a m?nu?a? | 
??atva? n?tra sa?deha? ?a?m?sena ca labhyate || 13 ||
viv?he gamane caiva k?le ca mara?e tath? | 
ava?yam eva kartavya? yogibhis tadup?sanam || 14 ||
This appears to be similar to the techniques found in early Tantric texts such as Svacchanda Tantra 7.268, etc. So I would understand ch?y?puru?opade?apari??lanena to be one who is skilled in interpreting the communications of the shadow person.
Hope this helps,
Michael
