"Brokering Nationalism & Historic Memory: The 2005 California 
Textbook Controversy over the History of Hinduism"

When: Thursday, May 2nd at 12:00pm
Where: Room 206, Ingraham Hall

This talk presents the main themes of Joy Johnson's Master's thesis,
which examines arguments made by Hindu Americans during the 2005-06
California History-Social Science Primary Textbook Adoption conflict.
Remembered by many academics and progressives as a failure of Hindu
nationalist textbook revisions, this event also offered Hindu Americans
the opportunity to take their place in a process of claim-making forged
by other American ethnic communities before them. This talk focuses on
the civic engagement practiced by Hindu Americans who supported the
revisions as well as the conflicting role played by California's
multicultural education policies, both encouraging the Hindu textbook
campaign and limiting its successes.

Joy Johnson is a Master's candidate in the History Department of UW --

high school world history in Kentucky from 2006-09. Her Master's thesis
unites her interest in modern South Asian history, South Asian diaspora,
and American educational policies.
