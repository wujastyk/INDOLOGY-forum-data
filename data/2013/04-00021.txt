[INDOLOGY] Bhattacharyya's Sadhanamala edition
Dear Paul,
If it isn't too much trouble, would you mind sending me your scans of the Sadhanamala as well?
Best,

Dear Tim,
I have scans of both volumes, which I did myself a few years ago.  The PDFs are fairly large (40Mb & 65Mb) and I'm traveling right now with a slow connection, but can send them to you when I get back to NYC next week.

Dear Indology List,
Does there exist a PDF of Benoytosh Bhattacharyya's two-volume edition of the Sadhanamala (1925-1928) in Gaekwad Oriental Series, which can be downloaded online?
With best regards,
