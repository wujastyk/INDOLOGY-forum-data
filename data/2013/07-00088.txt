Howard--
Thanks to the Br?hma?a obsession with making correlations/identifications/correspondences, you can get some idea of what the B?hat represents in the Veda by examining the entities with which it is correlated. The B?hat and Rathantara are treated as a pair in some of these passages, so that you also get an idea of the entities to which each is opposed. For example (PB 7.6.17, trans. Caland): B is the mind, R  voice; B is the melody, R the verse; B is expiration, R is inspiration; B is yonder world, R is this world.
Caland's translation of the Pa?cavi??a-Br?hma?a has an index of s?man names, so you can easily find all the passages that mention B?hat. The Jaimin?ya-Br?hma?a also has a lot to say about the B?hat; an accessible example is in Caland's Das Jaimin?ya-Br?hma?a in Auswahl ? 25 (p32).

Thank you very much. Do you know why these verses were called the "Great Saman", brhat-saman?

B?hat and Rathantara are considered two important s?mans in the Pa?cavi??abr?hma?a. B?hat is based on RV.6.46.1,2. See PB 5.1.10ff, 5.2.1,8.9.11 etc.

[INDOLOGY] question
In Bhagavad-gita 10.35, Krsna says, "Of sAmans, I am bRhat-sAman?"
Could someone kindly explain exactly what the bRhat-sAman is?
Thanks!
