[INDOLOGY] painting on canvas?
Thanks for all the replies. Dipak?s mention of the Mudr?r?k?asa is dated at the
4th century CE at the earliest. The word for cloth he mentions is the
same one I was interested in: pa?a.
Joseph pushes it a bit farther back to the first or second century CE,
although that?s still a bit later than what I was hoping for.
It may be I'll have to translate it only as 'cloth' and not 'canvas'.
Best,
Dean
