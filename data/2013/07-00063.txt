Thanks for all the replies. Dipak?s mention of the Mudr?r?k?asa is dated at the
4th century CE at the earliest. The word for cloth he mentions is the
same one I was interested in: pa?a.

Joseph pushes it a bit farther back to the first or second century CE,
although that?s still a bit later than what I was hoping for.

It may be I'll have to translate it only as 'cloth' and not 'canvas'.


Best,

Dean
