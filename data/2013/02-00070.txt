Subject: [INDOLOGY] Van Buitenen translation of Ramanuja's Vedarthasamgraha?
Message-ID: <B3CF9E6F-3D96-47F5-8F14-C25CC891E81E@gmail.com>

Dear Colleagues,

Did Van Buitenen translate the above text? If yes, where did he publish his translation?

I hope someone can help me as I have an incomplete reference to this translation and have not been able to locate it online.

Best Wishes,
