[INDOLOGY] palm leaf manuscript-Bhasa's plays.
To ALL,
        I am aware of renowned Indian Indologist Ganpathy Shastri's unique contribution when he founded 13 plays by Bhasa,(5th-6th CE) in a bundle of  palm leaf manuscript in 1910.  
                           Can anyone enlighten me as to whether this was the earliest mss of medieval Sanskrit literature.
