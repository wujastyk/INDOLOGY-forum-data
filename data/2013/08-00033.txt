Hi Andrew,

I?d wager a guess that V?raka is short for V?rabhadra, who is one of ?iva?s well-known ga?as (though admittedly I hadn?t thought about *when* he enters ?iva?s entourage). If that?s the case bet the ?ka suffix is probably abbreviative, for metrical purposes, rather than diminutive in meaning. :)

All best,
Travis

Subject: [INDOLOGY] "vIraka"

Dear learned colleagues,

In Kurma Purana 2.7 there is a section praising Siva, in which classes
of beings are named and he is identified with the best in each of
those classes; this is similar to the section extolling Krsna at BhG
10.21-39.

In the final quarter of 2.7.10 is "gaNeSAnAM ca vIrakaH". Can any of
you help me identify who this "vIraka" (mannikin, little man) is? Is
it a reference to some specific form of Siva, or perhaps to Skanda or
Ganapati himself?

Many thanks for your help.

Andrew
