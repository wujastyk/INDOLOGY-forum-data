translations with shabdalamkara
Hi Venetia, regarding attempts to capture the acoustics of an original in translation, Isabelle Onians'  translation of the 7th ucchvasa of the Dazakumaracarita -- the Mantraguptacaritam (chapter 12 in the Clay Library ed.) -- is worth a mention. The translation follows the original Sanskrit in not using labials: p, b, m; so as to reproduce the effect of the original wherein "Matragupta's lips have so been ravished with biting kisses that he is constrained to tell his story without allowing his battered lips to touch." (from p. 21 of Isabelle's introduction, which includes a wonderful note on the challenges involved in translating). 
Cheers, Chris
