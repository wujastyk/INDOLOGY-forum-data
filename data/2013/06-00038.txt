Subject: [INDOLOGY] dacoits, bandits, thugs and other unsavory characters

The closest I can come up with is the following

tad yatra vai k?atre??ra?yenaiti yo vai tatra ta? dasyur j?n?ti yad yat sy?lva? v? madhu v? bhavati ten?sm? ?vir bhavati (JB 2.423)
?Now if someone goes through the jungle with a k?atriya (or: with a jungle-k?atriya ?), if a non-Aryan notices him there, he shows himself to him with all the friendliness and sweetness at his disposal.?
There is, of course, also the bargaining for soma with a jungle dweller, but this does not convey echoes of dacoitry.

Best wishes,

Hans Henrich Hock

Colleagues:
A colleague has asked: " where in the Vedas and other relatively ancient texts might I find references to dacoits, bandits, etc."

Gratefully,
