For Hindu, Buddhist and Jain texts on this subject please have a look at 
Shingo Einoo, The signs of death and their contexts, in Shoun Hino and 
Toshihiro Wada (eds.), Three mountains and sebven rivers, Delhi 2004, 
pp. 871-886. There is also a method of divination based on the 
after-image after starring at one's shadow and closing the eyes then. 
Cf. my edition of Vagisvarakirti's Mrtyuvancanopadesa (ed. Wien 2010), 
chapter I, 26-33 and 93 seqq., with some more parallels.
