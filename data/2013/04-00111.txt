Dear Scholars
Can you help me out with a sandhi problem that arose in class the other day?
Raghuva??a 1.14
sarvatejobhibhavin? 
The commentary glosses this as 
sarv??i bh?t?ni tejas? abhibhavati iti sarvatejobh?v? tena sarvatejobhibhavin? 
The translation is something like 'by one who surpasses all in tejas'
External sandhi rules apply to words in compounds, e.g.
manas + hara = manohara
Therefore with tejas + abhibh?vin normally one would expect tejo'bhibh?vin (a? + a = o + ')
But in the root text and the commentary avagraha is not shown. In fact, as far as I know, there is no such thing as an avagraha in a compound.
Prof Greg Bailey kindly provided a number of other similar examples from Mbh, so this form is not particularly uncommon.
Does anyone know of a rule or a convention that covers this form? Put it another way, how should the combination a? + a be handled within a compound?
Yours
McC
