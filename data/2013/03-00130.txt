[INDOLOGY] Fwd: Haraprasad Shastri article
Does anyone have, by chance, a scan of the following?
Haraprasad Shastri. 1897. "Notes on Palm-leaf MSS. in the Library of His
Excellency the Maharaja of Nepal." *Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal
* 66: 310-16.
I've looked really hard in the Digital Library of India and Google Books.
There are lots of scans of parts of the JASB, including 1897 part II
(George King, on materia medica) and part I, with only a tr. of a book on
the Khojas.  But I can't locate that part of vol 66 that has Shastri's
article in it.  And the early vols. of JASB aren't in my local library as
far as I can see.
Many thanks,
Dominik Wujastyk
