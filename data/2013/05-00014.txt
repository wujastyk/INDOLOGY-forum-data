$95 is just about right for the cost of the books and postage.

I'm afraid I refuse to do business with Biblia Impex or their sister
business Aditya Prakashan, because of their politics.  One of the few times
I've had a stand-up row with someone about their racism was with the
proprietor in their Delhi shop.  But I know that they are an efficient
company.

Best,
Dominik
