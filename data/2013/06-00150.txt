[INDOLOGY] question for European Indologists
Here's one more kind of anecdote: in Lanman's book there is an "advice  
to students", or something similar. When I bought a second-hand  
version of it in Hamilton, Canada, some one wrote in in it clearly by  
hand in bold letters: 'Give up now before it's too late'. It  
encouraged me in my teaching to say: don't give up, just hang on.
Best,
Jay
