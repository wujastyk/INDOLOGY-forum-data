This collection of essays aims to trace the exchanges, responses, 
affinities and fissures between the worlds of Sanskrit and Tamil 
literary cultures in the medieval period. The literati who produced the 
works in these languages moved freely between domains that earlier 
Indological scholarship has tended to compartmentalise. The eleven 
studies presented in this volume strive to move beyond this narrow 
perspective and thus do justice to the richness and complexity of the 
cultural synthesis that took shape in South India in this period. By 
looking at the articulation of identities, practices, and discourses in 
texts of a range of genres composed in Tamil and Sanskrit (as well as 
Prakrit and Malayalam), these essays supply a picture of South India in 
the medieval period that is unique in its historical depth and 
conceptual complexity and demonstrate innovative ways to investigate and 
problematise cross-cultural phenomena, while suggesting how much work 
yet remains to be done.

Keywords: Sanskrit, Tamil, medieval, cultural and intellectual history, 
transculturation
