I find an old note that

Karve 1943-1944: 71 has remarked on the uses of *m?t?* and *amb?* for both
natural mother and step-mother in the *Mah?bh?rata*

Karve, Irawati. 1943-1944. ?Kinship Terms and the Family Organization as
Found in the Critical Edition of the Mah?bh?rata.? *Bulletin of the Deccan
College Research Institute* 5: 61-148..
