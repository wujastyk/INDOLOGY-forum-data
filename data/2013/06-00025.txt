[INDOLOGY] Dharmasastra quotation on upanayana
Dear Tim, dear Martin,
thanks for the interesting points (and for pointing to the 2005 article I had missed). I can only add that in M?m??s? discussions "a??avar?a? br?hma?am upanay?ta tam adhy?payet" is the standard reason adduced by Pr?bh?karas as a *?ruti* support of the adhy?panavidhi, i.e. the idea that there is a duty to teach the Veda and that one's duty to learn the Veda is only a subsidiary to it. Thus, at least for the M?m??sakas (the Bh???as dissent with the Pr?bh?kara view, but not with the *?ruti* status of the prescription) the prescription "a??avar?a? br?hma?am upanay?ta tam adhy?payet" has a ?ruti-status. It is, thus, seen as coming from a Br?hma?a. 
Best,
