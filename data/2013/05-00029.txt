Dear Colleagues,

Colleagues of mine and I would be very pleased to have an e-copy of a
rather rare article, hard however to find in European libraries:

Cornelia Dimmitt Church, "Eschatology as the denial of  death in Indian and
Iranian myth", Ohio Journal of Religious Studies 1 (1973), no. 2, pp. 29-37

Many thanks in advance for your kindness.

Best wishes,
Eugen Ciurtin
