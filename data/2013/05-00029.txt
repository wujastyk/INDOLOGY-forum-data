[INDOLOGY] (no subject)
Dear Colleagues,
Colleagues of mine and I would be very pleased to have an e-copy of a
rather rare article, hard however to find in European libraries:
Cornelia Dimmitt Church, "Eschatology as the denial of  death in Indian and
Iranian myth", Ohio Journal of Religious Studies 1 (1973), no. 2, pp. 29-37
Many thanks in advance for your kindness.
Best wishes,
Eugen Ciurtin
