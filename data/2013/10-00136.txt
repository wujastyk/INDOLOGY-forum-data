Dear colleague,
Still on the order matter, in the commentary you quote, the commentator understands e?a? as bound to apa?abda?, forming the subject part of the sentence (e?o'pa?abda?), and mleccha? as the predicate ?if I understood it right? ("this deviant word is [indeed] barbaric, known as barbaric"). But if that is so, how to account, syntactically, for yad being in between e?a? and apa?abda? in the original text? Would it be possible with e?a? as an adjective pronoun? 
Best wishes
