Dear Indologists and Art Historians,

I am trying to track down the whereabouts of the painting of the hero Hammir, attached below.

I thought it might be in the Binney Collection, now in the San Diego Museum, but I have had no luck with email enquiries.

If anyone knows where this painting might now reside, I would be immensely grateful for your help.

Many Thanks for your help,

Mary Storm
