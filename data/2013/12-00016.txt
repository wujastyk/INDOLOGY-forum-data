[INDOLOGY] Sanskrit Dictionary App for iPhone and iPad
Many thanks to Audrey, Charles and Tim for these suggestions.  I've been
using the pdfs for some time, but as Audrey says, it's a bit slow.  I'll
try out these additional methods.
Audrey I'd like to particularly compliment you and your colleagues on the
feature that shows related compounds, and not just those beginning with the
search-word but also those including it or ending with it (as in
Kotonoko)-extremely useful bit.  Although it's probably not simple, if in
future releases it would be lovely if you can enable expanding and
contracting the view on the phone with fingers, and the option to switch
contrast from white against black background to the reverse.
Charles, your  Kotonoko link is no longer working:
http://osx.iusethis.com/app/kotonoko
but this seems the latest version, 2.1.16
https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kotonoko/id593460126?mt=12&ign-mpt=uo%3D4
I may ping you later for some technical pointers.
Cheers
James
