Don't know about a Ko?a reference, but the word clearly betrays a Dravidian
connection. See [DEDR 4796] <http://kolichala.com/DEDR/search.php?q=4796> and
[CDIAL 9996<http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3:1:447.soas>
].
Burrow discusses this word in "Dravidian Studies VII", *Bulletin of the
School of Oriental and African Studies*, University of London, Vol. 12,No.
2 (1948), pp. 365-396 (See entries 259 and 275).
275. *me?a*- m. a whitewashed, storied house, L. [Pkt. *me?aya*-; Guj.
*me??*, *me?o *an upper storey, etc.].
    ~ Te. *m??a *a house of two or more stories, Ta. *m??ai *raised floor,
platform, terraced house. Cf. *m??i*.
