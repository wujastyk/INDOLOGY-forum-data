[INDOLOGY] Identifying deities
I was hoping that someone could help me identify the deities in the
attached document. I believe that they are associated with the Kiri Amma
cult in Sri Lanka which is in turn associated with Pattini. How this
relates to the actual image I'm not sure. Any help would be greatly
appreciated.
