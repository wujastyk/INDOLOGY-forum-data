[INDOLOGY] New Catalogus Catalogorum
?Dear Stella,
?I'm sorry your friends had a bad experience.  ?
?
D. K. Agencies
?normally ?
run a very professional service, with in-house MARC cataloguing to Library
of Congress standards. But my experience
?, dating back ?
about ten years
?,?
was also that they were
?good but ?
expensive.
Since then, the Indian Govt. has hugely ratcheted up the postal rates for
shipping books out of India.  It's a completely different prospect now,
than in the past, to send a book parcel from India to an international
destination.  And that has hit the international business of
?book distribution ?
companies
hard.
Best,
Dominik
