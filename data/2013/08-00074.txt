Subject: [INDOLOGY] looking for digital resources: where have I already	looked?
Message-ID: <CAKdt-CcVZAOMtmKZzo-AxoHc_0rcUrBcmGU=20wgTPKgSV+bRA@mail.gmail.com>

D
?ear colleagues,

These days, we often post queries to each other on the INDOLOGY list asking
whether someone has an e-text or digtized book, etc.  That's fine, no
problem.

But it would be helpful to the list members if such queries also included a
sentence saying where we have already looked.  As in, "I've checked the DLI
and Archive.org, and found nothing."

Best,
Dominik
INDOLOGY committee member.
