Dear Colleagues,
I am looking at two works authored by someone named Hari D?k?ita.  The
B?hacchabdaratna is clearly written by Hari D?k?ita who is the grandson of
Bha??oji D?k?ita, the son of V?re?vara, calling himself Vaire?vari.  There
is another work, the Brahmas?trav?tti authored by Hari D?k?ita (published
in the Anandashrama Sanskrit Series, no. 82), and this Hari D?k?ita calls
himself Lak?m?naraharis?ris?nu, his work dated to ?aka 1658.  On the face
of it, these are two different Hari D?k?itas, and yet I have noted that the
Brahmas?trav?tti seems to follow Bha??oji D?k?ita's Tattvakaustubha in
criticizing the Dvaita Ved?nta of Madhva and (p. 162) refers to the
Tattvakaustubha of Bha??oji D?k?ita: *vistaras tu tattvakaustubhe
dra??avya?.  *I am wondering about the relationship of these two Hari
D?k?itas.  I will appreciate if anyone has any suggestions or references to
any publications that deal with this question.
