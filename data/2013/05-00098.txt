[INDOLOGY] debt
There's also a section on the theology of debts in Olivelle's ??rama 
system, and, for Buddhism, there is a conceptually helpful discussion in 
Andy Rotman's "Thus Have I seen - Visualizing Faith in Early Indian 
Buddhism" (Oxford University Press 2009), in connection with pras?da 
(gift/reciprocity/debt - debt as obligation).
With best regards,
