[INDOLOGY] Japan link update
Dear colleagues,
The link to Osaka University, for George Cardona's Mah?bh??ya files has
changed to
   - http://hin.minoh.osaka-u.ac.jp/cardona/
But although the ?atapatha sound files are there, the Mah?bh??ya text files
have been removed.
I realize that the text is available via GRETIL, but I would like to ask
whether anyone knows what has happened to the original files hosted by
Osaka?
Best,
Dominik Wujastyk
