Subject: [INDOLOGY] Japan link update
Message-ID: <CAKdt-Cfm7V_NKOp9NftzMhX+iFaH_PpfyFWedCxc5RtbMTEO+Q@mail.gmail.com>

Dear colleagues,

The link to Osaka University, for George Cardona's Mah?bh??ya files has
changed to

   - http://hin.minoh.osaka-u.ac.jp/cardona/

But although the ?atapatha sound files are there, the Mah?bh??ya text files
have been removed.

I realize that the text is available via GRETIL, but I would like to ask
whether anyone knows what has happened to the original files hosted by
Osaka?
Best,
Dominik Wujastyk
