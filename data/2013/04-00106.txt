Fellow listers:
I wish to learn more about the ?ruka plant. It is supposedly used 
medicinally, and the St. Pete's has it as growing in the Himalayas, but 
I have come across it in B??a's description of the Punjabi (now Haryana) 
region called ?r?ka??ha. In that description it (or most likely its 
seed, nut, fruit?) is being pecked at by a chukar partridge (cakora).  
The phrase is: cakoraca?cujarjarit?ruka. B?htlingk and Roth, following 
the ?abdakalpadruma, assign it the synonyms v?r?ruka and v?rasena. The 
Hindi ?abdas?gar says it has a cooling effect. I simply would like to 
know what it is more precisely that this bird is pecking at.

Gratefully,
Bob Hueckstedt
