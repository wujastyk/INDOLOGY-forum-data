[INDOLOGY] Fwd:  Yves Ramseier - a short obituary
Yves was a true erudite, a perfectionist in his research and a helpful friend. His contribution to the Vaisheshika and Bhartrhari Studies is not so voluminous but ?very significant. We met in Paris and after that corresponded for some years. It is ?sad that he passed away so early!
