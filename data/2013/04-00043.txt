Dear List,
Has someone, hopefully, access to James Heitzman's "Early Buddhism, Trade
and Empire" (in: Kennedy K.A.R., Possehl G.L. (eds.), Studies in the
Archaeology and Palaeoanthropology of South Asia, New Delhi: Oxford
University Press, 1984, pp. 121-137)?
The book is not available in Poland
I would be very grateful for a pdf copy of the paper.
