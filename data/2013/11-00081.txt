This is of course very difficult to answer. However, we do know that real atrocities are committed against lower caste persons
regularly in India - anyone who follows Indian newspapers will be aware of this. And, in particuler, lower caste persons who are
perceived as somehow "uppity" are routinely the victims.

A particularly harrowing, though fictional, reflection may be found in Rohinton Mistry's novel A Fine Balance.

Manu & co., at the very least, provided an ideological fig leaf to cover genuinely monstrous behavior.
