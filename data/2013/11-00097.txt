they are all related to **m?-y* 'to end'. In Telugu, it is not uncommon to
find the phrase "mugi?cinadi" in such inscriptions.
Yes. That would be very interesting. But as Parpola says, could it be
simply the case of a Grantha u- mistaken for cu-? In Andhra Pradesh, there
are several place names associated with uppV-, such as uppala-p??u (20
different locations), uppal?ru (Krishna and Cudappah Dist.) uppalam
(Srikakulam Dist), pedauppalam (Visakhapatnam Dist) and Uppal
(Hyderabad/Rangareddi Dist) but nothing that starts with cupp-/supp-.

Suresh.
