The
following statement of facts is made irrespective of the various guidelines issued
by different publishing authorites.
Da??a??? is
more Hindi orthography than pronunciation -- Sanskrit or NIA. Da??a ????, sa?khy????????, instead
of sa?khy???????, sa?caya ????? instead ofsa?caya????? more correctly present the pronunciation. According to a
widely prevalent mode of assimilation,? m, also n, modifies itself
into a nasal consonant before a plosive according to the latter?s place of
articulation. 
North
India?s Hindi press prefers the anusv?ra, apparently, for the sake of
economy. But this economy of alphabets will be found in manuscripts too. ???The orthographical levelling hides the actual
pronunciation.
