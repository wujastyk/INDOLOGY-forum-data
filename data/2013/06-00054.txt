Dear Palaniappan:

Very interesting discussion. What percentage of the Tamil-Brahmi
inscriptions show the spelling of p?pp?r as opposed to p?rpp?r?

1. I believe *p?r (-pp-, -tt-)* 'to see' is unrelated to * p?(r)pp??*
'Brahmin';
 Although DEDR grouped them under the same entry (4091a and 4091b), I am
not very sure if we can make a semantic connection of 'see' with 'seer' in
Dravidian.

2. CDIAL entry 9327 shows Pk. *ba?bha?a,*S. *???bha?u, *kal. *ba?bhana, *OB.
 *b?mbha?a, *Or. *b?mbhu?a*, *b?bhu?a, *Bi. Mth. *b?bhan, *Bhoj.*b?mhan*, *
b?bhan, *among other reflexes. We cannot ignore the close similarity of
these reflexes with Te. *b??p**?**?u*, Ta. *p?pp??**.*

3. I think you would agree that connecting *p???i/**p?**??i *with *
p?(r)pp?? *is a bit far fetched.

Without more information about the socio-linguistic situation of the early
periods of the Indo-Aryan and Davidian interaction, I think, we cannot
easily determine if *p?r (-pp-, -tt-)* 'to see' is related to *
p?(r)pp??* 'Brahmin'
or not.
