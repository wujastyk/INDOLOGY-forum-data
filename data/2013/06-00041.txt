[INDOLOGY] dacoits, bandits, thugs and other unsavory characters
Dear Bob,
I think you'll find, among ancient texts, richer materials on this in the early Buddhist and Jain canons
than you will in Vedic sources. The Buddhist arhat Angulimaala comes immediately to
mind as an ideal typical proto-thug.
all best,
Matthew
