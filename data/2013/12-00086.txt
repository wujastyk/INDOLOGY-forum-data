[INDOLOGY] ISO 15919
Dear Arlo,
Dr Anthony Stone was involved in creating ISO 15919, and I made a link to
his pages from
   - http://indology.info/papers/
One can't get a free copy of the standard there, I'm afraid, although
Anthony's pages are full of information and may answer some questions.
Best,
Dominik
