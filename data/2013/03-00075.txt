Subject: [INDOLOGY] Nagararjuna finger pointing to moon reference?
Message-ID: <1363682641.55030.YahooMailNeo@web125305.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>

Does anyone have the exact text reference for the statement attributed to Nagarjuna that one should look to the moon, not the finger pointing to the moon? In other words, the words of the teaching are not the same as their realization.

Best,

Dean
