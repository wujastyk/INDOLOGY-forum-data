[INDOLOGY] vidhya?
Dear Colleagues!
Just a minor query. A student of mine noticed that in India, the word vidy? not infrequently is spelled "vidhya" (in Roman transcription). Does anyone have an idea what may be the reason for this strange spelling? Is it restricted to certain areas? 
Best wishes,
Sven Sellmer
