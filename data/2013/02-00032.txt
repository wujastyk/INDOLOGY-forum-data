Message-ID: <161227098841.23782.2466843159283285174.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>


Would anyone, perhaps the author himself, be able to deliver a pdf of the book in question?

I am hoping that its Tibetan cousins will help me better to appreciate this sadly misinterpreted Javanese specimen (and another one just like it).

Best wishes,
