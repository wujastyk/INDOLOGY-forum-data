John Huntington's book The Phur-Pa, Tibetan Ritual Daggers
Would anyone, perhaps the author himself, be able to deliver a pdf of the book in question?
I am hoping that its Tibetan cousins will help me better to appreciate this sadly misinterpreted Javanese specimen (and another one just like it).
Best wishes,
