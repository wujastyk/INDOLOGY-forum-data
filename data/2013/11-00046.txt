[INDOLOGY] Brahmin Priestesses
Equally, and by a set of sound changes essentially identical to those
described by Palaniappan, the second element in t?vantikai could be
referred to -vandy? ('praiseworthy').  Skt. Devavandy?, I find, occurs in
list of 1008 names of the G?yatr? mantra: this slightly obscure place
notwithstanding, it also makes better sense semantically: "she who is to be
praised by the gods" rather than "a barren woman of [?] the gods", thus "a
divine barren woman".
