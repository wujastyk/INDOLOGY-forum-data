[INDOLOGY] molten lead in ears
It might be worth adding that similarly horrific punishments also appear in the narrative literature, such as the KathAsaritsAgara, and sometimes with not a chilling but a comic effect.  Still, I wouldn't interpret such episodes as evidence of the absence of literal application of such punishments "on the ground."
