An (optional) cultural tour following at the end of the workshop will include visits to a number of  traditional villages where the 3 Vedas are taught and recited along with the performance of Vedic rituals. It also includes a visit to an old, large  Nambudiri estate where various arts of Kerala are taught and preserved. 
Looking forward to meeting you there.
