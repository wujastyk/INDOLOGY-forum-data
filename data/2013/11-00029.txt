[INDOLOGY] Fleet's Gupta Inscriptions
Dear List members,
I wonder if anyone would have an available pdf of Fleet?s Inscriptions of the Early Gupta Kings and their Successors, CII vol. 3 (1888 with several reprints)? I would prefer one of the later reprints, as I understand there are further observations included, but not the Bhandarkar, Chhabra and Gai revised version of 1981, which is entirely different.
Thanking you in advance for your kindness,
Ronald Davidson
