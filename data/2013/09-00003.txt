Dear members of the list,

For a conference on Indian games (to be held in Brussels, see www.asindia.eu for more details - in French), I am looking for good pictures of boards used for playing the Indian ancestor of 'Snakes and Ladders', called gyan caupar/bazi, nagapasa or moksapata. I have read Andrew Topsfield's articles in Artibus Asiae and, if somebody could give me his Email address, I would be grateful.

Regards,

Jean Michel Delire
