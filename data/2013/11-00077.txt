has this:
<<...the practice current in the times of the Ved?nta-s?tras that the ??dra
is not entitled to study the Veda.
Gaut. XII.4 went so far as to prescribe:?
?if the ??dra intentionally listens for committing to memory the Veda, then
his ears should be filled with (molten) lead and lac; if he utters the
Veda, then his tongue may be cut off; if he has mastered the Veda his body
should be hacked'.>>
Hoping it's of some help,
