Dear Arlo:
In the commentary on this by Lak?m?dhara, Vyavah?rakalpataru (Dharmako?a, I: 523), we have: j?vad?n?dikai? "ma prag?m apathy vayam" ity?dibhi?. 
The Divyatattva comments: j?vadanamantras tu ??rad?y?m -- "p????ku?apu?? ..> *and a long explanation (too long for me to type it out here!!). The Divyatattva was edited and translated by Richard Lariviere (Manohar, 1981). This is a much more tantric rite.
Aiyangar's edition (I have a hard copy) does not add much to this; the Kyoto electronic copy is based on it.
Best,
Patrick
