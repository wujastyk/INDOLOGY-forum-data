Judit T?rzs?k and Dominic Goodall have an entry on the K?rukas in vol. II (p.92) of the T?ntrik?bhidh?nako?a:

> k?ruka, n.m. [].
> A P??upata* or L?kula* sect, mentioned several times in Bhairavatantras* and by Abhinavagupta as inferior to tantric ?aivas; none of their texts seems to have survived. They are referred to in SvT 11.71ff. where they are said to be at the level of m?y?tattva* when liberated; SYM 1.18 mentions them together with pram??a-p??upatas, whose initiation is not appropriate in the system of the SYM (accepting Diwakar Acharya??s emendation of k?raka to k?ruka in the text, personal communication), and T? 13.305 also notes that they remain bound souls from the point of view of Bhairavatantras. K?emar?ja??s commentary suggests that the founder of the sect was a disciple of Lakule?a, just as Musulendra was. [J.T.]
> K?rukas are held to be impure and contact with them is to be avoided according to the following Siddh?ntas: Kir 35.8, 38.7; Moh, fol. 44v; PKm 1.111. [D.G.]
