Re: [INDOLOGY] Hoernle epigraphical note
Dear Colleague,
I am writing from India where the downloading facility mentioned by you is not available. Could I by any means have the opportunity of reading the paper by Hoernle online?  I did not know of the paper. If you have difficulty in sending that to me I shall find out a way somehow. That will take some time, however. With thanks in advance

Oops, here is the whole volume on Google books.  In the US, you can
download the whole volume.  If you cannot, I can extract the Hoernle
article and send it.
