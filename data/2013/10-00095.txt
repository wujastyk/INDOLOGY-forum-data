[INDOLOGY] Shalihotra Samhita
Dear colleagues
Can anyone help Catherine with this source?
Please respond directly to her off-group at vajracat at gmail.com<mailto:vajracat at gmail.com>
Thanks in advance

I am searching for an english language translation of Shalihotra Samhita. Sorry for using a wiki link but it gives the most concise overview.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shalihotra
I have searched online, google scholar, anu library, trove etc but can not find the source material, only references to it.
Could you suggest where I might look? I have the Tibetan version but as there are several references to an English translation from Sanskrit, I am trying to locate this version.
Kind regards,
Catherine
