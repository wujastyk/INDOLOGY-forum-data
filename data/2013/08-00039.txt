[INDOLOGY] "On the Literature of the Hindus" ?
Joseph:
I too recently was looking for information on Caul. The article, according
to Rosane Rocher, is written by Caul, with a commentary by JOnes:I found
just one reference: "Though he [Jones] obtained from Govardhana Caul, the
Kashmiri Brahman newly appointed pandit to the Supreme Court, the brief
account "On the Literature of the Hindus," which he presented to the
Society on the 4 May 1787, in the longer commentary he [Jones] appended..."
(Rocher, ("Weaving Knowledge: Sir William Jones and the Indian Pandits"
1995: 59)
The commentary (Jones's section) begins "The first chapter of a rare
Sanscrit Book, entitled VidyAdersa, or a View of Learnings is written in so
close and concise a style, that some parts of it are very obscure..."
I presume, then that the title of the book being cited is "Vidyadersa"
(perhaps, "Vidya-darsha" but with Jones's odd orthography, which at the
time was often based on Bengali pronunciation).  He also then quotes the
beginning of the text:

(p. 104 of Volume 2, Asiatick Researches, London, 1792 edition)
I have no idea what text this might be, but perhaps others will recognize
it.
Some help, I hope...
