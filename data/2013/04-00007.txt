Moreover, as a participant observer, I am exploring ways to perhaps improve upon Bourdieu's concept of the 'participant objectified' in which he asserts, allows for the required epistemological break, by objectifying the participant through taking a rarefied step back, in what sounds somewhat similar to the practice of the silent witness, or at least reminds myself of the practice.
Even though the intended? results between the sociology of Bourdieu? and practice of witness consciousness may be different it is interesting to think about the possibilities and similarities. Or, perhaps, it exposes my ignorance on both topics?
