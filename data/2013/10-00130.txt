Thanks to Dominik W. and Lars F. for the propositions. 

I think yad is the main problem in fact... and still. It is solved by Lars as 'because': the syntax becomes smooth in terms of order, but still taking apazabdah as bahuvriihi sounds to me quite strange. 

As for Naageza's explanation brought up by Dominik, it leaves yad out, as far as I could gather from the translation. 

Understanding mleccha as an adjective of apazabda, albeit uncommon, as noted by Naageza himself, seems rather ok. But next the text goes: mlecchaah maa bhumety adhyeyam vyaakaranam. 

So it seems to me that maybe the commentators were a bit at lost with that construction themselves, don't you think?

Best

One might think, N?ge?a said, that the word mleccha would usually refer to a person or a place; how could it refer to a bad word?  But in this case it is a term of criticism.  "A bad word (apa?abda) is really despicable (mleccha)."
