Thanks to all who correctly identified the verse. This is cited, curiously, in a Dharmanibandha text, Devanabha??a's Sm?ticandrik? (Mysore edition, Sa?sk?rak???a, p. 27) in support of the importance of local norms and customs with respect to dharma.

I would be grateful for any information on the context of this statement, i.e. what if anything is at stake. Also, do we find similar claims elsewhere, and does such advocacy ever attempt to explicitly refute or harmonize with strong, apparently countervailing, universalist claims based on 'sanatana-dharma', a broad brahminical aitihya, or other authorities?
