Dear Indologists,

I am the new section editor for Hindu Theology in the _International
Journal of
Hindu Studies_.  This section publishes constructive evaluations and
creative
(re)interpretations of any Hindu tradition, text or thinker, in manners both
critical and sympathetic. It also encourages new perspectives on non-Hindu
thought developed from Hindu philosophical and theological perspectives, and
seeks to facilitate communities of interpreters of the Hindu traditions.

We are writing to ask you to prepare an essay for the Hindu Theology
section.
The IJHS is a peer reviewed journal with seventeen years of history, and it
is
committed to a rapid response (three months or less).

Sincerely,
Jonathan Edelmann

Asst Prof of Religion, Mississippi State University
