[INDOLOGY] Unicode Devanagari font that functions in InDesign?
Dear colleagues,
   I am happy to report partial success, based on the information in the link that Peter provided:
I should mention that I am working on Mac OS machines (running OS X.7 and OS X.8).
Although I did not have success with the World-ready template and did not pursue any of the information pertaining to version CS4 (I am running CS 5.5 and CS 3.3), I did have luck under CS 5.5 with one of the third-party options -- the IndicPlus plugin by MetaDesign (Free 7-day trial; $49.99):
	http://www.metadesignsolutions.com/products/indicplus-indesign-cs4-5.php
There are free trial installs for CS 2/CS 3, as well as for CS 4 through CS 6.
The trial version of the plugin for CS 2/CS 3 did not work for me under InDesign CS 3.3, however the CS 4-5 plugin *DID* work under CS 5.5.
In InDesign CS 5.5, the IndicPlus plugin correctly resequenced vowel marks in (apparently) all the Devanagari fonts that I tried, but only formed correct conjunct characters for some fonts.
The legacy "Devanagari MT" from Mac OS X.2 (?) does not work (perhaps it is just too old), but other fonts such as "Nakula" and "Sahadeva" available from John Smith's webpage:
	http://bombay.indology.info/software/fonts/devanagari/index.html
as well as the "Sanskrit2003" font from Itranslator:
	http://www.sanskritweb.net/itrans/#SANS2003
and the "Chandas" and "Uttara" fonts from:
	http://www.sanskritweb.net/cakram/index.html
all work just fine now.  Presumably, other more recent fonts will work as well.
Much thanks to everyone,
