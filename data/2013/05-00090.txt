But in Sanskrit without accents, we have to rely on the context to make this distinction.  A good case may be adharmac?rin that I have seen in a few places, where it indeed means those who behave in unrighteous ways.

But I can't think of indicators other than context that would allow to determine which interpretation is to be preferred.

Medh?tithi commenting on this verse (and the Sm?ticandrik? [Mysore ed. III: 287] cites Medh approvingly) appears to think that these two men were proficient in adharma, that is, in subterfuge (chala). Then the compound would consist of adharma and j?a -- adharma being here ways of subverting justice. In the Sm?ticandrik? the example given is a man who, knowing that other kinds of evidence is valid only for a year (I am not sure how he gets this??), gets a document written with 10 thousand pa?as, when it should have been just 5 thousand. This is the chala or adharma (ways of getting around legal procedures) in which the man if proficient.
