[INDOLOGY] INDOLOGY Digest, Vol 10, Issue 16
Several of our users have noticed that Unicode characters are not legible
in their emails from INDOLOGY.  This is caused by the "digest" feature that
gathers together a number of INDOLOGY posts into a batch and sends that to
you in once a week or so.  If you switch the setting of your INDOLOGY
account to not digest messages, then you will see all the Devanagari etc.
Best,
Dominik
