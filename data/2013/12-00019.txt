[INDOLOGY] Sanskrit Dictionary
Thanks Peter for the information on your Integrated Sanskrit Dictionary --
what a fantastic resource; congratulations on such a major achievement.  I
see that your Apte also links to definitions that include the head word,
which is a really useful feature.  It would be lovely if later versions
could include hyperlinks within the definitions--Tony Duff built such a
feature into his Illuminator, and it's often very handy. By the way,  I
noticed that the links to 'Bothlink' and to 'Scharf's Ramopakhyana' don't
seem to be working this morning.  If you could send a link to the app Ralph
Bunker developed that would be great.
Cheers
