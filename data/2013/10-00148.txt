Hello Don,

This also may be relevant to your question.

Mayrhofer in his KEWA [sv:  paTaH (sorry, Dominik, we are philologists
here, for the most part, and we have an incorrigible habit of displaying
our  knowledge of Latin rhetorical short-hand); none of us talk like this,
of course!]:

Mayrhofer there, glossing paTa as "woven cloth, garment, blanket," refers
also to three neuter nouns: paTalam: 1 = cover, veil; 2 = heap, mass; 3 =
basket.

He also cites a masculine noun paTalaH = section of a book.

The propetymology of these words are difficult
