Greetings,
Does anyone have a contact address or email for this press?  I received
notice that they had published Citsukha's Bha?vatattvapraka?s?ika?, but I
have not be able to contact them, nor will I be able to visit Varanasi in
the near future.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Sincerely,
Jonathan
