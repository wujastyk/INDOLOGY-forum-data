[INDOLOGY] (no subject)
Dear All,
If, by any chance, anyone of you has access to this article:
Herman Tieken, ?The interrogative pronouns ka?, k?ni and ki?ti in the
A?oka edicts", Acta Orientalia 64 (2003), pp. 39-63
I would be grateful for a pdf copy of it - our library does not
possess recent numbers of AO.
Regards and greetings from snow-covered Warsaw,
