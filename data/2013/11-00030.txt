It makes sense to absorb 'a', if the language does not have many conjuncts.
There is a lot of saving in typing. We write ??? using only three strokes
'kml' instead of 'kamala'.

But for a language like Sanskrit which has so many conjuncts, it hardly
makes any difference. While you are saving on '?', you are paying with
'?'s.  I did a small experiment with Bhagvadgeeta. I encoded it with these
two different schemes. The one with '?' had only 5% extra characters than
the one with '?'.
