Sorry, when I said Kollam era was in use in Tirunelveli district, I meant the old undivided Tirunelveli district which included the present Tuticorin district.

Suresh,


You are right. The Tamil Lexicon gives the following entry.


?????-??? muki-
, 4 v. intr. cf. ????-. [T. mugiyu, K. mugi.] To end, terminate; to be finished; ???????. ??????? ????? ??????? (????????. 681).


So we can just take it as muki?catu 'finished'. Here it means 'completed'. 


While uppa?am is a common name, the important factor to consider is the use of Kollam era.


If Uppa?am is the correct reading in the manuscript, there is also another Uppa?am near Srivaikuntam in Tuticorin district. See http://www.onefivenine.com/india/villages/Tuticorin/Srivaikundam/Uppalam . The region between Tuticorin and Tiruchendur is famous for salt pans.


Kollam era is in use in Tirunelveli district also where traditional wedding invitations and horoscopes still use Kollam era.  However, I do not know about the presence of Jaiminiyas in that area in the 19th century. 


Regards,
Palaniappan

Dear Palaniappan, 


Thanks for the Tamil Translation.

Here is a possible translation of the first Tamil sentence:


(The manuscript which) Cuppa?am Kesavan wrote and tied/bundled or completed in the year 1039 (of the Kollam era) on the fifth day of the month of K?rttikai.


Is it possible muki?catu is really muti?catu? It could mean tied/bundled or completed.



Isn't mu-k- 'to end, terminate' [DEDR 4891] is different from mu?i 'tie/bundle' [DEDR 4921] (Also see [DEDR 4922]). May be, they are all related to *m?-y 'to end'. In Telugu, it is not uncommon to find the phrase "mugi?cinadi" in such inscriptions. 
 

The name Cuppa?am is interesting linguistically. There is a place called Uppa?am near Colachel in Kanyakumari district. Uppa?am means salt pan. If the name Cuppa?am was still prevalent in the 19th century, this might be an instance of an existence of PDr. Cuppu in this compound in Tamil even up to 19th century!



Yes. That would be very interesting. But as Parpola says, could it be simply the case of a Grantha u- mistaken for cu-? In Andhra Pradesh, there are several place names associated with uppV-, such as uppala-p??u (20 different locations), uppal?ru (Krishna and Cudappah Dist.) uppalam (Srikakulam Dist), pedauppalam (Visakhapatnam Dist) and Uppal (Hyderabad/Rangareddi Dist) but nothing that starts with cupp-/supp-.


Regards,
Suresh.
