Dear Dominik,

Unfortunately, when I attempt to access Jim Mallinson's article, I find that it is blocked. I'll try it again
using a VPN later.

I was surprised, from the introductory paragraph, by the assertion that "the first detailed depictions of Indian ascetics are not found until circa 1560 in paintings produced under the patronage of Mughal Emperor Akbar."
At best this may be true if the qualificaton, "found in Indian art" is added, but otherwise it is false:
painted depictions of Indian ascetics dating to the first and early second millennium are known from
both Central Asian and Tibetan materials. I believe, too, that earlier Pala and Nepalese manuscripts
contain miniatures depicting ascetics, but perhaps these are not sufficiently "detailed" (though it's sometimes
remarkable how much information the miniatures do contain).

best regards,
Matthew
