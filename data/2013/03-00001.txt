Dear colleagues,
Could anyone with easy access to the critical edition perhaps tell me whether there are any significant variants for these two verses? It is no doubt naive to even hope for such philological luck, but I would be very pleased indeed if it would be possible to tease out of the transmission of these verses some word like s(u)var?adv?pa or s(u)var?abh?mi, to stand beside yavadv?pa. For various epigraphical sources from Indonesia speak mysteriously of a saptasuvar?abh?mi (and synonyms), whereas these R?m?ya?a verses, as they stand, say of yavadv?pa that it is saptar?jyopa?obhita.
Thank you.
