Vedantatattvaviniscaya Chapter of the Madhyamakahrdayakarika
Dear Colleagues,
I am looking for an electronic copy of Olle Qvarnstrom's Hindu Philosophy in Buddhist Perspective: The Vedantatattvaviniscaya Chapter of the Madhyamakahrdayakarika. Lund: Plus Ultra, 1989.
Does anyone know if this work includes the Sanskrit text?
If it does not, then I am also looking for the Sanskrit text!
My library does not have it and I would like to use it in a class (thus an inter-library loan is likely to arrive too late).
Thanks in anticipation,
James Hegarty
