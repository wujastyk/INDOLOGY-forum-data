[INDOLOGY] Introducing Jainism
Dear friends,
I will shortly be teaching an introduction to Jainism, though this is not at all my field.
If any of you have taught such a course before and have syllabi you might share with me,
I would be most grateful.
I think that I am familiar with most of the books one might choose to use in this context, but
I would be most interested in any remarks on your experiences with the texts you have
used in class. References to articles and more obscure sources that you have found
useful would be most appreciated as well.
I am not at all familiar with pertinent audio-visual resources and would welcome recommendations,
if such materials are available.
with thanks in advance for your suggestions,
Matthew
