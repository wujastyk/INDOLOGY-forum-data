[INDOLOGY] Devanagari keyboard
Dear friends,
Does anyone have some instructions for the use of the microsoft Sanskrit keyboard? It's
easy enough to work out the basic consonant + vowel combinations, but I've not so
far had much success with conjunct consonants. Any advice will be gratefully received.
thanks in advance,
Matthew
