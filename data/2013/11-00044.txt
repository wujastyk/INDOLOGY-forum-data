That makes sense, except that in this system (as in the Roman) you have to type "a" after the consonant to get e.g., "ka". But that is a small price to pay for the ease.

If you actually want a virama on the screen, you just type a consonant with a following space (no vowel).  Which seems totally logical to me, and requires no superfluous keypresses.  So typing "karman " -> "??????"

The reason for "f", I assume, is that Devan?gar? assumes the vowel "a" after a consonant, unless there is a vir?ma; and "f" has that function. So, if you really want a vir?ma -- you type the consonant and "f" and give a space.

It's the same whatever program I'm using,  because the keyboard/language stuff is handled by the operating system, not each individual program.  As far as I know, anyhow.  It's handled by software on my system, Ubuntu Linux, called Ibus and m17n (which comes with Devanagari and IAST romanization already pre-defined).
