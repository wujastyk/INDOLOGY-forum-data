Another Query
Thank you to Whitney Cox and Harunaga Isaacson for 
suggesting, correctly no doubt, that visar?ru is likely just an
orthographical variant for the well-attested vi?ar?ru
meaning "perishable."
Whitney adds that the term seems to have been characteristically
used by Kashmiris, though I don't believe that Kamala??la was from
Kashmir.
