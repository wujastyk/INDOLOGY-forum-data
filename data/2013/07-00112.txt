I extend my sympathies to you on this loss. I knew Prof. S. D. Joshi for a long time, from 1963, and we exchanged ideas fairly often.  Though I often disagreed with his conclusions on particular issues, I have always had the highest respect for his deep erudition and ability to set forth ideas clearly.  He made major contributions to the study of vy?kara?a. For these and through his students his memory will live on.  George Cardona
