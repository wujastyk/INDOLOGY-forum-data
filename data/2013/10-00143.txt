[INDOLOGY] Money for open-access publications being made available to Wellcome Library users
In a startling and innovative move, the Wellcome Library in London is
offering to pay the article-processing fees for open-access publication by
authors whose research incorporates a substantive amount of information
from the Wellcome collections.  Remember, the Wellcome has a very large
collection of Sanskrit, Prakrit, Hindi, Persian, Sinhalese and Tibetan
manuscripts and a large collection of Sanskrit and Hindi printed books and
lithographs.  And the collections are by no means narrowly confined to
medical topics, but cover all disciplines, with world-class strengths in
tantra, Jainism, ?yurveda, rasa??stra and stotra.
