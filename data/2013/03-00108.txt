Dear all, 

I echo the sentiments of our colleagues: the passing of Cal Watkins, my long time colleague at Harvard and a good friend, is a major loss to all of us. Much of his work deals with Vedic language and philology as well as with Indo-European mythology ("How to kill a dragon"). He has inspired all of us with his insights. A very good man, he will be missed very much.  

Michael
