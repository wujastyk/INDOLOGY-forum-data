[INDOLOGY] unidentified Grantha manuscript (C.A. Formigatti)
P.S. We have only two manuscripts of the S?maveda in the CUL 
collections: a Devan?gar? paper ms acquired By C. Bendall from Bhagvan 
D?s Kevaldas at Bombay in 1885, and a palm-leaf Devan?gar? ms of which I 
do not remember the provenance at the moment (I will check again). They 
still have to be catalogued, though.
