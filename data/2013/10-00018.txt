Also, Rennell's Canoge is surely Kannauj.  One of the tributaries of the Ganges south of the city seems to be known as the Kali nadi (see e.g., http://www.jnvkannauj.org/history.php ).

A couple of copies of the 2nd edition of Rennell (1788) are available from Archive:
http://archive.org/search.php?query=creator%3A%22Rennell%2C+James%2C+1742-1830%22

There is a 3rd edition (1793) with an additional map in Google books.

Best,
Tim
