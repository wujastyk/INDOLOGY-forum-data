Close observers will have noticed that with the change to the new INDOLOGY
software, we've lost the ability to search the archive of past messages (
http://listarchive.indology.info/).

My colleague Patrick Mc Allister, INDOLOGY webmaster, has now built a
search system for the archive.  It is available here:

   - http://listsearch.indology.info

The indexes to the archive are updated weekly.

Many thanks indeed to Patrick for his excellent contribution.

Best,
Dominik Wujastyk
INDOLOGY committee
