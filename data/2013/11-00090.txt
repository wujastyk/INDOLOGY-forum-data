[INDOLOGY] Who is Sumati
Following further on Viktoria Lysenko's query and Jay Soni's helpful response,
I note that several other Hindi works on Jain philosophy take up the
problem of Sumati as well. 
These include:
??????????? ???????? , ??? ????? (Bharatiya Jnanpith Prakashan 1966), pages 25, 151
?????????? ??? , ????? ?????? ??????? ?? ??? ?????? ?? ??????? (Varanasi 1995) pages 27, 30, 45, 62-3, 66
For the most part, these just review what can be gleaned from TS and TSP, and include, too, the
same references already given by Jay Soni. The former clarifies, though, that the "the eulogy of Malli?e?a" 
is from an inscription found at Sravanabelgola, with full citation and references to the published text of the
inscription in question.
