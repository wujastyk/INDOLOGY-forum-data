Times have changed, indeed, and for the better, and everyone can now have a good laugh at anecdotes about what might have been like to be teaching Heidegger or Merleau-Ponty in an Anglophone department back in the 60s and 70s (Burt Dreyfus recalled recently how he nearly lost his job at MIT after complaints from his colleagues that such "stone age" philosophy had no place in the curriculum). 

Many philosophy departments here in the US take pride nowadays in calling themselves pluralist, even those dominated by folks trained in the analytic tradition. 

Now, if only non-Western philosophy was better represented we could all get on with our business and stop worrying about having to fight political battles.

>> Believe it or not, in some continental, yet undoubtedly western philosophy departments they still teach some old-fashioned philosophical subjects such as ontology and metaphysics... luckily (from my point of view) philosophy in the West has not yet generally become what the Anglosaxon world is trying to reduce it to. So it would be well advised not to make such sweeping statements equating ?western philosophy? tout court with analytical philosophy.
