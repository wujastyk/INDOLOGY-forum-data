This may have nothing to do with the Tantric use of the term, but ch?y?puru?a occurs as a measurement, often related to the sundial, in Kau?ilya's Artha??stra: 1.19.6-7; 2.20.10, 39 (have notes to these). And on the ability to eliminate one's shadow: 14.3.5-15. The length of a ch?y?puru?a appears to be 12 a?gulas.
