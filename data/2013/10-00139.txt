Dear Andrew,

Yes, I think it works. I feel insecure about the causal nature of ha, though. 

Also by applying this value of vai as topic marker, wouldn't e?a? ?not apa?abda?? be on the predicate spot, since [yad apa?abada?] should be a predicate in apposition to an already given predicate?

I don't know If I could made made myself clear...

I keep thinking.
 
Best wishes
Adriano

("this deviant word is [indeed] barbaric, known as barbaric"). But if that is so, how to account, syntactically, for yad being in between e?a? and apa?abda? in the original text? Would it be possible with e?a? as an adjective pronoun?

>> Dear colleague, If I understand you properly, you consider that the expected form should be ya?, construed with apa?abda?, hence the syntactic problem.  On the other hand, yad can be adverbial, equivalent to yasm?t.  This is the syntax given in the S?ktiratn?kara (ed. Vaman Shastri Bhagavat, p. 44.5-6): ???????? ?????????????? ? ??? ???????????????? ???????? ???????????????????? ?????????
