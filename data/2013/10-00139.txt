=?utf-8?Q?Re:_[INDOLOGY]_Pata=C3=B1jali's_syntax?=
Dear Andrew,
Yes, I think it works. I feel insecure about the causal nature of ha, though. 
Also by applying this value of vai as topic marker, wouldn't e?a? ?not apa?abda?? be on the predicate spot, since [yad apa?abada?] should be a predicate in apposition to an already given predicate?
I don't know If I could made made myself clear...
I keep thinking.
Best wishes
