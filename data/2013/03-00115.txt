Dear Dr.
Daheja,
I think
the answer to your question should depend on which Ved?nta or which-age-Ved?nta
you are addressing. ?a?kara denounced and rejected S?nkhya challenging it as
the main adversary. But later Ved?nta
accommodated the S??khya
philosophy as a lesser truth.

[INDOLOGY] Tan Matra
Friends~
Would it be correct to say that the Sankhya concept of Tan Matra would not be acceptable to the Advaita Vedantins as it brings in multiple, rather than, a single reality?
Kind regards.
