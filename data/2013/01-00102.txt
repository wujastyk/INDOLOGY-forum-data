> derived version of the files that you may produce must be covered by the
> same CC license (the freedom propagates).  The full details are in the

> As always, much gratitude is due to Patrick Mc Allister<http://ikga.oeaw.ac.at/Ma/MA_mcallister.html>for his hard work and support in maintaining the INDOLOGY and SARIT
