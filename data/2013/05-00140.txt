[INDOLOGY] Sanskrit syntax
I join others in praising this work, and in suffering owning an edition
from a less than perfect printing.
I, too, was thinking of some sort of joint effort.  In fact, the text could
even be re-keyed by a group of us (say 40 of us, each taking on ten pages).
 If someone is willing to set up a template beforehand, the work will be
that much easier.  Here, we should think about making the text highly
readable for the digital age (format it to the now ubiquitous 16:9 computer
screen).
I do not have the technical skills to set up the template, but I would like
to hear others thoughts on this.
