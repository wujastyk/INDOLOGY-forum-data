As remarked in this thread, the term ?experimental archaeology? has been
used, apparently by extension, in cases that are not ?archaeological? in
the strict sense of the word (e.g., in connection with reconstructions
based on data in the history of science such as experimental constructions
based on Leonardo Da Vinci?s designs of a parachute and a tank.)
By a similar extension of ?experimental archaeological? methodology, would
it be possible to test Paa.nini?s ?GRAMMAR? with regard to linguistic data
that are geographically and chronologically AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE to this
ancient device of which the precise purpose and original context remain
unclear and disputed to this day?
In other words, would it be possible to give Paa.nini?s grammar a
?test-ride? in the ocean of early Middle Indic of which samples are
epigraphically attested, geographically and chronologically close to
Paa.nini?s native area: king A?oka?s inscriptions, found throughout ?India?
including the North West.?
One attempt to do this can be found in my ? N?r?ya?a Bha??a?s
Prakriy?-sarvasva and P??ini?s ?e. ? that appeared in Studies in Sanskrit
Grammars : Proc. of the 14th World Skt. Conference, ed. by G. Cardona, A.
Aklujkar, H. Ogawa : 163-194 (Delhi: D.K. Publishers 2012), page 166
