Dear Professor Wujastyk,

This journal would be a great avenue for young and vintage scholars! 

You mention that "there are no fees for authors for the next two years." I tried to find out from the concerned website what might be the fees otherwise, but I couldn't find an answer. 

Could you please let us know what the fee would be for anything concerning this journal?

Thanks and regards,
V.S.Rajam
