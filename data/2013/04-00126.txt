[INDOLOGY] "History of Science in South Asia" journal launch
Dear Professor Wujastyk,
This journal would be a great avenue for young and vintage scholars! 
You mention that "there are no fees for authors for the next two years." I tried to find out from the concerned website what might be the fees otherwise, but I couldn't find an answer. 
Could you please let us know what the fee would be for anything concerning this journal?
Thanks and regards,
V.S.Rajam
