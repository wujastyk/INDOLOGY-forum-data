[INDOLOGY] Brahmin Priestesses
A more plausible derivation for *t**?vanti*/*t?vantikai *would be from  the
flower name *c**?mant?*/*s**?**mant?*/*s**?mantika *?the Indian white rose
Rosa glandulifera?*.*
The alternation of  the radical vowel between ?- and ?- would point to a
possible presence of palatal.  In Telugu, this flower is known as c?mant?, c
?mant? or c?vanti. Irregular word-initial *c*- > *t*- is not uncommon in
Tamil and other Dravidian languages[1][2], as evident in the
transformations of the following borrowings from Indo-Aryan:
*sattva *?strength? > *cattuvam, tattuvam*
*sn?nam *?bath? > *t?nam*
*samtati *?lineage? >* tantati*
*?sanam *?posture? > *?canam *> *?tanam*
Intervocalic /m/ > /v/ is well-known in South Dravidian.
Therefore, I propose:
**c**?-/**c**?**ma-**nt-i**> c**?**mant? > t**?vanti *?the Indian white
rose Rosa glandulifera?*.*
It goes well with the other flower names used for characters in the
*Cilappatik?ram *such as *m**?tavi *(related to *m**?dhavi*).

Suresh.
