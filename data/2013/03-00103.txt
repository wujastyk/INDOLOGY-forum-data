Dear Shri Maitreya,
Your mail did get posted. It also generated some
speculation, inconclusive though. As far as I remember checking the New
Catalogus Catalogorum was not suggested by anyone. That will be time consuming
but something leading to something.

Dear list-members,?


I sent the following message to the Indology list at the end of February, but I believe it didn't come through, perhaps because of the transition period from the old to the new server. I hope someone will have an answer to this question:

Does someone have a rough estimate of the number of available "Veda" Manuscripts? Or of manuscripts cataloged under the rubric "Veda" or "Vedic"? I know this might be a tricky question considering the different criteria applied to the classification of manuscripts in different collections, but perhaps someone has already looked into the matter before.?
Perhaps, to simplify my question a little: do we have an estimate of the number of existing Veda Samhit? manuscripts of the different ??kh?s?

Thank you for your responses.?

Best,?
Maitreya B. Larios
