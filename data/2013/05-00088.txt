[INDOLOGY] Query on negation
If we are dealing with accented Sanskrit, then adharma+j?a would give us
the ud?tta accent on the final syllable, while a+dharmaj?a would give us
the initial ud?tta.  But in Sanskrit without accents, we have to rely on
the context to make this distinction.  A good case may be adharmac?rin that
I have seen in a few places, where it indeed means those who behave in
unrighteous ways.
