[INDOLOGY] Review Paramaanu of theory
It seems to me you've read too much from that simple statement. I for one
was educated in an old-fashioned continental philosophy department, yet had
to study both contemporary logic and history of logic in separate courses.
I did not see a tout court equation in Howard's comment.
Kind regards,
Aleksandar
