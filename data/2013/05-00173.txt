[INDOLOGY] Chambers MS collection?
You can try with the director of the Orient section of the Staatsbibliothek (former Royal Prussian Library), 
Hartmut-Ortwin Feistel, but I think he has since retired:
h-o.feistel AT sbb.spk-berlin.de
Or, perhaps better, try Gerhard Ehlers at the Academy; he is heavily involved with the description ofStaatsbibliotkek's Staatsbibliotek's Indian MSS:
Gerhard Ehlers <gerhard.ehlers  AT sbb.spk-berlin.de>
