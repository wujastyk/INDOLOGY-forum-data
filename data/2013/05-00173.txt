You can try with the director of the Orient section of the Staatsbibliothek (former Royal Prussian Library),

Or, perhaps better, try Gerhard Ehlers at the Academy; he is heavily involved with the description ofStaatsbibliotkek's Staatsbibliotek's Indian MSS:

Gerhard Ehlers <gerhard.ehlers  AT sbb.spk-berlin.de>

This happened probably some thirty years ago, but I am sure you can contact them to find out about the current availability of manuscript-photographs.
