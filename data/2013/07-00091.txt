Dear Mr. Resnick,
I am sorry that I forgot to reply to your second query. I planned a reply?but found little time and then the matter slipped from my mind.. It is more regrettable because in 1984 I had raised the issue of a Brahmana based interpretation of the Vedic ritual against one based on the mantras cited in the Srautasuutras. The Brhat and Rathantara were the illustrations where a Brahmana based interpretation could be misleading. Please see Mythological and ritual symbolism SPB Calcutta 1984:137-138. I caution you that Klaus Mylius wrongly remarked that I had taken the idea of a sutra based interpretation from Renou. You will yourself see the difference from Renou. I have no hesitation in saying that both Mylius (JIP 1989) and Karel Werner (JRAS 1987) were disappointed that they could not determine what I my intention was.?I admit my short comings, but your question will be answered.
Best 
DB
