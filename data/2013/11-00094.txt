[INDOLOGY] unidentified Grantha manuscript
The word ?ra?am can also refer to Veda in general. Here is the Tamil Lexicon entry.
*????? ?ra?am
, n. cf. ?ra?yaka. 1. A portion of the V?da. See ????????. (??. ??. 8, 27, ???.) 2. V?da, by synecdoche; ?????. ??????????????? (??????. ?????. 2).
So please do not look for any ?ra?yaka text here. It might be a a S?ma Vedic text.

Re: [INDOLOGY] unidentified Grantha manuscript
Here is a possible translation of the first Tamil sentence:
(The manuscript which) Cuppa?am Kesavan wrote and tied/bundled or completed in the year 1039 (of the Kollam era) on the fifth day of the month of K?rttikai.
Is it possible muki?catu is really muti?catu? It could mean tied/bundled or completed.
The name Cuppa?am is interesting linguistically. There is a place called Uppa?am near Colachel in Kanyakumari district. Uppa?am means salt pan. If the name Cuppa?am was still prevalent in the 19th century, this might be an instance of an existence of PDr. Cuppu in this compound in Tamil even up to 19th century!
Normally Grantha will be Tamilized as kirantam. Here it seems to be kurantam
The text seems to be dealing with ark??ip??ha of the 14th S?ma, 6th kha??a.  
Hope this helps

[INDOLOGY] unidentified Grantha manuscript
Dear Collegues,
I'm desperately trying to find out which text is contained in a manuscript that I'm currently cataloguing.
The manuscript (belonging to the Cambridge UL collection) is written in Grantha script. The text appears to be composed of four p??has, called ark??i, vrat?ni, dundu, ?ukl??i: the p??has are organized into sections called (from the larger to the smaller) kha??a, s?ma, mantra (this last always abbreviated as ma.).
The beginning of the text runs like this:
om v?co v?te dve | huve v?c?m | t? | v?ca? v?ca? huve v?k | ?hya ?ya ta ?a | ???otu ?r?otu v?g v?k | hy? dya ta ?a | samai tu samai tu v?g v?k | re | ramat?? ramat?? ram?t? au ho v? | kilu kha?i | ih? ih? ih? | t? | s?ma? | 1 | huv? iv? c?? | ?? ca | v?ca? huv? i | k?c c? ?a | v?k | ta ?a | ?r?otu ???ot? v?g v?k | c??a c?ka phaplata ?a |
The explicit runs like this:
?ukro? | c? | ?ukra ho i | dvi? | ?ukra h? ? uv? | ?yu ?ya | e bhr? X? bhr?j? | tac ka ?ya kha | ma | 40 | pr?j?patya? g?yatra? pr?j?patya? g?yatra? | tat savitur pare?yo? | ca ?r? | bhargo devasya dhim?h?? ? dhiyo yo n?? pr?c?rha? bh? o v? | ?y?c ka?yi sa? ca?aka | ?ya ?yac | ov? hu? bh? | sa? ac ?ya | o v? | c? | 41 |
Final rubric:
?ukl??i p??hasam?pta? | hari om | ity ?ra?ap??hasam?pta? | ?ubham astu ?r?gurubhyo nama? |
Colophon (in Tamil language and script, added by a different hand):
cuppa?am kesava? ?ra?akuranta? 1039 ?m ta k?rttika m?cam 5 til e?uti muki?catu
The words cuppa?am kesava? ?ra?akuranta? recur also in the final rubric of the ark??ip??ha:
s?ma? 14 | kha??a? 6 | ark??ip??ha sam?pta? | cuppa?am kesava? ?ra?akurenatam |
The title seems to be "?ra?akurantam (= ?ra?ya-grantha?) of Kesava?", but I can't find any text bearing such a title (or a similar one) in any catalogue nor in the internet. Any suggestion will be highly appreciated!
Many thanks in advance,
Marco Franceschini
