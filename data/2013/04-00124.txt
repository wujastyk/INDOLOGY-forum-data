The mystery of the two Hari D?k?itas is now resolved satisfactorily.  Hari
D?k?ita, the author of the Brahmas?trav?tti is the son of Lak?m?n?si?ha who
composed the Advaitic commentary ?bhoga on Kalpataru, a commentary on
V?caspatimi?ra's Bh?mat?, and this Lak?m?n?si?ha is the son of
Kau??abha??a, who  is the nephew of Bha??oji D?k?ita.  So, one Hari D?k?ita
is the author of the B?hacchabdaratna, and the grandson of Bha??oji
D?k?ita, while the other Hari D?k?ita is the great-grandson of Bha??oji
D?k?ita's brother Ra?gojibha??a.  No wonder that both Hari D?k?itas show
respect to Bha??oji D?k?ita.  Best,

Madhav Deshpande
