=?utf-8?Q?[INDOLOGY]_early_Jahrb=C3=BCcher_f=C3=BCr_wissenschaftliche_Kritik?=
Could a colleague who has access to the first volumes of the /Jahrb?cher 
f?r wissenschaftliche Kritik /let me know if they have a review of 
Bopp's /Ausf?hrliches Lehrgeb?ude der Sanskrita-Sprache/, and, if they 
do, who wrote it?  Such a review should have appeared in the volumes of 
1828 or 1829.  The run of /JWK /in the Penn library begins in 1832, 
which is also when the electronic run by the Hathi Trust begins, and our 
otherwise wonderful system of interlibrary loan does not work for journals.
Also, if anyone has a copy of Peter von Bohlen's review of Friedrich 
Rosen's /Radices Sanscritae /in /J//WK///1828, coll. 65--85, I would be 
grateful for a copy as well. // //
With thanks and best wishes,
Rosane Rocher
