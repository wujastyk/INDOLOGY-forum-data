[INDOLOGY] unidentified Grantha manuscript
Dear Asok,
Thanks for confirming. But I had checked before suggesting the Jaiminiya Saamagaanam. I had Vibhuutibhuushan Bhattacharya's Sampurnanand Sanskrit Iniv. edn with me

I can confirm that this is a complete manuscript of the ?ra?yaka G?na
of the Jaimin?ya S?maveda, from the beginning of the Vrata parvan to
the end of the Pr?j?patya? g?yatram, which is the final s?man.
In the beginning, read vrate instead of v?te. The seventh syllable t?
is Jaimin?ya svara notation.
The manuscript must be from the Kanyakumari District, where there still
are Tamil Jaimin?yas, as Masato Fujii and I could find out in our search
for Jaimin?ya manuscripts. They would naturally use the grantha script but
also the Kollam era of Kerala. In grantha, u and cu are not too different,
so probably you have to read Uppa?am mentioned by Palaniappan instead of
Cuppa?am.
Are there any other manuscripts of the Jaimin?ya S?maveda in Cambridge,
and is there any information of the provenance of this manuscript?
Who has presented it, and when?
With best regards, Asko Parpola
