Birgit,


Their website <http://www.kickstarter.com/help/guidelines?ref=footer> says,

> Who can create a project on Kickstarter?

?Maybe there's a way round it.  I don't know.  I'll write and ask them.  I
remember when they opened their UK branch, there was a big hoo-ha that "now
people in the UK can do it too" and that "we'll be expanding to other
countries in due course."

Best,
Dominik?
