The last I knew, the curator of MSS at the Madras GOML was Dr S.
Soundarapandian.  You'll need to write to him.

Oriental Manuscripts Library and Research Centre
University of Madras Campus
Chepauk, Madras, Tamil Nadu 600 005
India

tel: 253-651-30 (you'll have to work out the codes, and this may not be
current)

Best of luck.  It's highly likely that you'll have to go to Madras to get
sight of your MS.
