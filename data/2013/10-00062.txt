Dear Collegues,

does anyone happen to have a pdf of Sukum?ra's K???avil?sa with the commentary called Vil?sin? by R?map??iv?da? I'm trying to identify an incomplete grantha manuscript: it seems to contain parts of that work, but to be sure I need to check the manuscript against the edition.

Thank you very much in advance.

Best wishes,

Marco Franceschini
