[INDOLOGY] Publication Announcement
Thank you Andrew, and congratulations on your prize-winning publication. Forgive me for commenting based on the blurb, but I assume it to be accurate.
	"?thinkers treated the philosophies of Vedanta, Samkhya, and Yoga, along with the worshippers of Visnu, Siva, and Sakti, as belonging to a single system of belief and practice. Instead of seeing such groups as separate and contradictory, they re-envisioned them as separate rivers leading to the ocean of Brahman, the ultimate reality." 
	This is certainly true in the case of some thinkers, and these thinkers did eventually emerge as powerful shapers of what one might call unified Hindu thought.
	It bears mentioning that some of the involuntarily "unified" communities, certainly strict Vaishnava groups, perceived this development with something akin to theological horror. Indeed the greatest Vaishanva Vedantists, including Ramanuja, Madhva, and Baladeva, explicitly sought to refute the notion that all paths lead as rivers into the ocean of Brahman, unless by that one meant Krishna as param brahman (Gita 10.12)
	Thus for centuries there has been strong tension, and theological battles, between on the one hand the unifying Hindu view, including what Halbfass called the "Neo-Hindu" thought of Vivekananda, Radhakrishnan etc, with their roots in Sankara et all, and on the other hand the various Vaishnava traditions including the Sri Vaishnava followers of Ramanuja, the Dvaita-vadi followers of Madhva, and the Gaudiya Vaishnava followers of Caitanya.
	I present all this not as an argument against your thesis, which I basically accept, but rather to elicit your learned view on the matter.
	Thanks!
