Dear colleagues,

Is anyone aware of a published ??rad?-sahasran?ma?  My colleague
Christopher Tompkins has found a MS of a ??rad?-sahasran?ma in Kashm?r, and
is editing it. There has been rumour of a published version from south
India, but I haven't been able to locate it.  Can anyone help?

best,
Chris Wallis
