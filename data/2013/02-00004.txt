Amazon's "not available" note against the title "Sanskrit: an Easy Introduction to an Enchanting Language" misleads many interested persons. I requested Amazon more than once to change the wording to "not available from us" if not to the more helpful "available from the publisher."  It refuses!

An Italian adaptation of the book came out from the publisher Hoepli in Milano last year.

Ashok Aklujkar's Sanskrit book had audio cassettes along with the printed books. I am not sure whether these are still available, but Ashok should be able to let us know.
