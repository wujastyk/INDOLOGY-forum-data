[INDOLOGY] Experimental Archaeology and ancient India
I thank Dean Michael Anderson, Fran?ois Voegeli and Britta Schneider
for their helpful replies (on and off line) to my query.
Having re-read Harry Falk's article after I read it first in the mid-1990s
I now understand that the item that
was reconstructed was a "candidate" vajra that is ultimately rejected. It
deserves, in my view, mentioning
in the wikipedia-list of examples of experimental archaeology.
The question remains whether there are any more spectacular instances in
indology, the reconstruction of
an ancient boat and try it at sea, for instance, which could be joined
to the wiki-list or a similar one meant
for a larger public.
Best,
Jan
