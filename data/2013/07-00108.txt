[INDOLOGY] scribal self-recitation while copying
I haven't read Data's 1971 article, but in the other citations I don't
recall detailed documentation for the interesting 4-5 modes of copying and
3 types of copyists that you mention.  Could you point to the documented
evidence for each, please?
Many thanks,
Dominik Wujastyk
