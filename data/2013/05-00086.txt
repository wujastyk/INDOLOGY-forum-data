[INDOLOGY] Query on negation
Brendan Gillon once argued that the distinction between the two types of 
negation called prasajyaprati?edha and paryud?sa is precisely the one 
that accounts for the different interpretations in Patrick Olivelle's 
example: a syntactic difference in terms of whether the negation has 
wide scope (prasajyap.) - "not knowing the dharma" - or narrow scope 
(paryud?sa) - "knowing something that is not dharma". But I can't think 
of indicators other than context that would allow to determine which 
interpretation is to be preferred.
