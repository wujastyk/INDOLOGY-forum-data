[INDOLOGY] Yves Ramseier - a short obituary
Very sad indeed. I met him last in 2010 in Lausanne, when he invited me to
his residence near Boston.
I remember, in 1995, we had jointly started keying in the text of the
Kasikavrtti, I to start from the beginning, he to start from the end. He
said "Let us see where we meet." We met around the beginning of the 5th
chapter.
