[INDOLOGY] Seeking article: Annual Report of the Royal Asiatic	Society (1860)
Sorry for the inconvenience -- am looking for the obit of Horace Hayman
Wilson that appeared in the Annual Report of the Royal Asiatic Society
(1860), and am having technical difficulties downloading it thru my
university library. If you have it easily to hand, it would be much
appreciated.
Thank you,
Laura Harrington,
