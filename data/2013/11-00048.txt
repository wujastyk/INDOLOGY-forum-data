A long-running copyright lawsuit between the Authors' Guild and Google over
its book-scanning project is over, and Google has won on the grounds that
its scanning is "fair use."
In other words, the snippets of books that Google shows for free don't
break copyright, and Google doesn't need the authors' permission to engage
in the scanning and display of short bits of books.
The ruling<http://publicknowledge.org/files/google%20summary%20judgment%20final.pdf>(PDF)
was published this morning by US District Judge Denny Chin, who has
overseen the case since it was filed in 2005.
