[INDOLOGY] mAtAjI
I have seen and translated this or similar verse, but cannot put my finger on it. The issue, however, is NOT about speaking about about "seeing"  -- that is regarding. In the verse I have seen the locatives are given as accusatives: m?t?vat parad?ra? ca etc. Also the last p?da, as I remember it runs: ya? pa?yati sa pa?yati -- one who sees (this way), truly sees.
