I just remembered that in the late eighties or the nineties Prof. B.N.Mukherjee discovered some evidence of the presence of Sakadviipii Brahmins in Bengal at the close of the ancient period, perhaps 2nd or 3rd century CE. Professor Mukherjee was not in good health when I last tried to contact and was not available for communication.

Re: [INDOLOGY] ??kadv?p?ya brahmans
Dear Dominik, Madhav and Dipak,?
Perhaps still not THE most but at least MORE up to date (list of relevant publ. in chronological order, 1812-1976, at the end) is:?
"Mi?ra in India and the Hinduized Magi" by H. Humbach in Acta Iranica 17 (1978): 229-253.?
Nagendra Nath Basu's publication not mentioned though.?

Basu?s Vanger j?t?ya itih?s ?Caste history of Bengal?,
Br?hma?akha??a (=Vol.1).
Basu has other writings on them, in English too, but these require corrections
and are not dependable.
