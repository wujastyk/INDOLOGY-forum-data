Thanks very much to all
May thanks too all colleagues who wrote me in help in my quest. Let me pass on the ?quote from Hadith, for use in your studies.
"Kanna filhindhi nabiyyun asvadhul lavni ismuhoo Kahina???
A Prophet appeared in India. He was black in complexion. His name was Kahina".?
This saying (Hadith) is found in the book?'Firdowsul Akbar'?by Hazrat Thylami.?
With my best?
