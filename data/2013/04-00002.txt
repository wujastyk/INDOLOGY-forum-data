The words should be jal?bhim?nin? devat?, vidyudabhim?nin?
devat?. ?Deity meaning self to be water etc? may be a rough translation.
These are not citations. See ?a?kara on Brahmas?tra 2.1.5 for the concept.

Re: [INDOLOGY] (no subject)
Hello all,
Can anyone help me by identifying what is being cited here? It does not seem to be RgVedic or from the early Upanishads:
'Thus
every object has its corresponding devata. The rishi is perfectly
explicit when he says, ?Jalavimamini devata,? ?Bidyudavimamini devata?
etc., i.e., the ?devata? which illuminates water, the ?devata? which
illuminates lightning, etc.'
The quotation is from pp. 143-44 of Girindrasekhar Bose, "The Psychological Outlook of Hindu Philosophy,"?Indian Journal of
Psychology5 (1930: 119-46; repr. The Modern Review. Jan. 1931: 14-25.
Thanks for any reply,
Alf Hiltebetel
