Abstract

The springtime festival of Hol? has long posed a problem for Jains.  Jain
ideologues have criticized the celebration of Hol? as contravening several
key Jain ethical virtues.  In response, Digambar Jain poets developed a
genre of Hol? songs that transformed the elements of Hol? into a complex
spiritual allegory, and thereby ?tamed? the transgressive festival.  This
essay analyzes the six Hol? songs (*pad*) by the poet Budhjan (*fl.* CE
1778-1838) of Jaipur.  An investigation of this Digambar genre of Hol?
songs encourages us to see that many of the ?Hindu? Hol? songs from this
same period were also engaged in a process of reframing and taming Hol?.
Both Hindu and Jain songs translated its antinomian and transgressive
elements into softer, less threatening sets of metaphors specific to their
spiritual traditions.

Prabh?candra?s
Status In The History Of Jaina Philosophy

Abstract

In dealing with the history of Jaina philosophical speculation after the
age of the ?gamas, K. K. Dixit in his now well-known 1971 work *Jaina
Ontology* (pp. 88?164) conveniently divides the specu?lations into three
stages which he calls the ?Ages of Logic?. It is Prabh?candra, one of the
thinkers of the third stage (apart from Abhayadeva, V?dideva and
Ya?ovijaya) which concerns the content of this paper, because Dixit makes
contrary statements about him. On the one hand, he says that ?the range of
Prabh?candra?s enquiry was less comprehensive than that of Vidy?nanda
and his treatment of topics less advanced than that of the latter? (p.
103). And, on the other hand, on p. 156, he says that Prabh?candra ?had
made it a point to introduce in his commentaries an exhaustive and
systematic discussion of the major philosophical issues of his times? (even
including aspects not found in his predecessors, e.g. theories of error).
