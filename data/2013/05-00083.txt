[INDOLOGY] Harvard Sanskrit manuscript cataloguing project
I think it's worth remarking that "Indic" and "Sanskrit" are not synonyms.  Materials in Tamil, Telugu and other languages are as important for Indic studies -- even premodern Indic studies -- as those in Sanskrit.  The projects Peter describes are certainly worthwhile and significant.  At the same time, we should be mindful that there are large stashes of manuscripts in languages other than Sanskrit that have never been scanned or digitized and that are slowly falling apart in libraries and other places in India.  Scholars have done a pretty good job with Sanskrit.  Other important languages have not had the same degree of care.  George Hart
