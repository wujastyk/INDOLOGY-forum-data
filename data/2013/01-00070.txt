*Description*
/Getting Married/ is the third and final volume on Hindu and Buddhist 
life-cycle rituals among the Newars of the ancient city of Bhaktapur in 
Nepal. It combines extensive fieldwork and the edition and translation 
of relevant ritual handbooks. While /Handling Death/, the first volume, 
focussed on the dynamics of death and ancestor rituals, and /Growing 
Up/, the second volume, focussed on the rituals of childhood, 
adolescence and youth (especially the male and female initiation 
rituals), the present volume deals with a number of rituals related to 
marriage. After an introductory overview of studies on marriage rituals 
in Nepal the authors give some basic marriage rules of Hindu and 
Buddhist Newars, the social topography and hierarchy, the families of 
the marriage partners as well as the problems of endogamy and exogamy in 
Bhaktapur. They present a detailed description of Hindu and Buddhist 
marriage rituals among Newars (which are partly documented on the DVD 
included in this book) and come to relevant conclusions regarding 
life-cycle rituals in general and the place marriage rituals occupy in 
Newar society and Hinduism. Furthermore the texts used by Brahmin and 
Buddhist priests during these rituals are edited and translated and 
complemented by comprehensive Appendices including a list of elements of 
Newar rituals and mantras as well as a mantra and general index to all 
three volumes. The richly illustrated books have been highly appreciated 
by the scholarly community as a unique attempt to provide a 
comprehensive ethno-indological study of all major life-cycle rituals of 
a certain Hindu and Buddhist community.
