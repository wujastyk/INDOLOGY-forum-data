Dear All:

Can anyone enlighten me about the significance of the comparison of a man abandoning his own dharma and taking up that of someone else to the two eyes of a partridge?

svadharma? ya? samuts?jya paradharmarucir bhavet |
cakoranayane caura? sa ??dra? candrasa?nibhe || 

cited by Apar?rka (p. 17) and ascribed to the Skanda Pur??a.

Is this a reference to the eyes of the partridge drinking the moonbeams, thus stealing it? Or is there more to it?

Thanks.

Patrick
