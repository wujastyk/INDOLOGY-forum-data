?From time to time, the issue of copyright comes up for all of us.  I just
discovered this useful guide,
   - Hirtle, Hudson and Kenyon, *Copyright and Cultural Institutions:
   Guidelines for Digitization for U.S. Libraries, Archives, and
Museums* (Ithaca,
   NY: Cornell University Library Press, 2009)*.
   *
which may be freely downloaded:

I mention it because it is written in clear language, well laid-out, and
addresses the kinds of issues that we commonly face as humanist scholars.
It's a bit USA-o-centric, but does talk about international issues too.
Best,
