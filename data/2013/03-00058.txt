[INDOLOGY]  Need Oldenberg Brahman PDF
Does anyone out there have a pdf of the following article that you would be willing to share?
Hermann Oldenberg, "Zur Geschichte des Wortes brahman," in Nachrichten von der Ko?nigl. Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften (1916), pp. 715-744.
Our interlibrary loan is going to be a bit slow on this one and the Internet Archive does not have this volume.
Best,
