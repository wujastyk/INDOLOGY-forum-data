The first time I really ?studied? Sanskrit (and then understanding the  
mantras which we had learnt by rote), was in the 70s, and through the  
Jesuit priest Antoine?s book on Sanskrit. in 2 volumes. Now it sounds  
strange that a traditional Sanskritist here in Banaras used this as a  
text book, this was for English speaking students.

By that time I had passed the stage of fearing the classical languages  
as with Latin when we said at school: Latin is a subject as dead as  
dead can be; it killed the ancient Romans and now it?s killing me!
Sanskrit is now keeping me alive.
