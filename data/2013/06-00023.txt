[INDOLOGY] Another indological success at Kickstarter
I join Dominik in congratulating Michael Slouber for this success!
In particular, whether one plans to use Kickstarter or not, I recommend
that all (and our younger colleagues in particular) take a close
look at Michael's page (the link given by Dominik) as a very canny
example of self-presentation. Many of us in this field are not
very good at communicating just what it is that we do to a possibly
larger interest group - we can learn a thing or two from Michael's initiative.
