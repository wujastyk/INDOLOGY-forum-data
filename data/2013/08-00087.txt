[INDOLOGY] (no subject)
The correct etiquette in such cases is for a mutual contact to send
Gayathri's note to Cardona, giving him the choice of whether to take up the
conversation. Since George is a member of this forum, it is not necessary
to do anything further.
?Please don't send such enquirers private information ?about other INDOLOGY
members, including their email addresses.  I'm sure such enquiries are
normally well meant, but it's not appropriate to just respond to them
without due care.
?Best,
Dominik
INDOLOGY committee?
