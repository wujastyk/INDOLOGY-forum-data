[INDOLOGY] Site coordinates (again)
Dear Fran?ois and Dominik,
For Kayatha I found the following coordinates in A. Ghosh (ed.): An Encyclopaedia of Indian Archaeology, Leiden 1990 (Vol. II, p. 217):
23?14'; 76?2' (District Ujjain).
The other sites are not included here. I suppose, while going through the journal "Indian Archaeology -- A Review" published by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), that one will be able to find them. It is not within my reach now. Alternatively you could write to the ASI.
Best,
Corinna

Could "Kayatha" be "I??ak?yatha" "I??ak?patha" or "I??ak?pura"?? It's a place I've been tracking for a while, and I think I might be able to help a little.? What is the source of your "Kayatha," if I may ask?
Best,
Dominik
