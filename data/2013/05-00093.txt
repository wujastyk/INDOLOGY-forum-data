[INDOLOGY] Query on negation
I would like to point out that the EDSHP, Deccan College, Pune has a
policy of a. recording compounds and b. showing such meaning differences
in such compounds with a cut, an ic (immediate constituent) cut. I believe
they have covered 'adha...'. I do not have the Dictionary with me as I am
travelling but surely the word and the reference, Patrick quotes, may be
referred to there.
