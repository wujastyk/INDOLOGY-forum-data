[INDOLOGY] mAtAjI
This thread included the comment that in Bengal men address even their daughters as Ma, and so far as I know this is indeed the case.
Two questions:
Is this so widespread outside of Bengal?
Among Bengalis, is the use confined to Hindus or is it current among Muslims as well?
Both of these questions, of course, are pertinent to the issue of whether or not this should be 
considered 'Hindu' usage?
