Subject: [INDOLOGY] Government Oriental Manuscripts Library (Chennai)
Message-ID: <f999b01792020dcde17c384691564d5a@fabularasa.dk>

Dear List,

I am trying to locate and obtain a scan/copy of a manuscript ostensibly 
held in the Government Oriental Manuscripts Library (Chennai) without 
actually going there. Unfortunately, I have even not been able to find 
any email contact information for the library.

Any assistance would be highly appreciated.

Best,
Jacob
