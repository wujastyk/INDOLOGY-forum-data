Namaste!
I'm glad to introduce new Sanskrit-Eng. dictionary (software). This particular dictionary based on the list on verbal roots of Srila Jiva Gosvami.
Devanagari and Eng. search is available through whole data-base.
Data-base of the dictionary has near 10 000 final forms.

All files for downloading (esp. "sandic.db") are available at:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/dhatu-patha/files
Link for those who didn't see the main dictionary, created earlier:
