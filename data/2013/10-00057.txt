[INDOLOGY] (no subject)
I do not know if it will
profitably add to the conversation but there is a story with a moral about
Ch?y?puru?a current in Varanasi. A banker?(name will not be given) of Varanasi
had assumed the form of or had made a Tantric assume the form of a Ch?y?puru?a
to lure away the widow of the daughter- in-law of the Diwan of a Central-South
Indian state around the year 1900. The widow was killed after she had been made
to surrender her jewellery.?After the income from the property had
been invested in his bank by the perpetrator of the crime the bank failed.
Everything the criminal had went away with the bank. He died of heart attack.
A thin
reflection of Alexandre Dumas?
