Subject: [INDOLOGY] "vIraka"
Message-ID: <CAFZJJzFRjJsNJ2emsu0PgHdZ=Ua9NZ7Cwo3HLNcdydNeZTUP5w@mail.gmail.com>

Dear learned colleagues,

In Kurma Purana 2.7 there is a section praising Siva, in which classes
of beings are named and he is identified with the best in each of
those classes; this is similar to the section extolling Krsna at BhG
10.21-39.

In the final quarter of 2.7.10 is "gaNeSAnAM ca vIrakaH". Can any of
you help me identify who this "vIraka" (mannikin, little man) is? Is
it a reference to some specific form of Siva, or perhaps to Skanda or
Ganapati himself?

Many thanks for your help.

Andrew
