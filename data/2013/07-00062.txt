Dear Prof. Rajam,
I am deeply touched to learn of the passing of Mrs Jeanne Hein. I never met her and I only was in touch with you through mail, but I kindly ask you and her family to accept my most sincere condolence and deepest sympathy on this big loss. 
I am glad that you were able to publish your precious book on Henriques, and I can only say thank you to you both for the valuable contribution you gave to Tamil scientific community with your work.
Kind Regards,
Cristina Muru
