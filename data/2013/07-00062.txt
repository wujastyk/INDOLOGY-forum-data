Dear Prof. Rajam,

I am deeply touched to learn of the passing of Mrs Jeanne Hein. I never met her and I only was in touch with you through mail, but I kindly ask you and her family to accept my most sincere condolence and deepest sympathy on this big loss. 
I am glad that you were able to publish your precious book on Henriques, and I can only say thank you to you both for the valuable contribution you gave to Tamil scientific community with your work.

Kind Regards,

Cristina Muru

Jeanne was suffering from the Alzheimer's for the past four years, and passed away at the age of 94 on Saturday (July 6) night at home in Bethany, New Haven, and was at peace, as anyone would wish. Services are on Saturday, July 20th.

There's no one now to tell us about it any more. Thankfully, we have captured a small amount in our book. I have no words to express the pain of my loss.
