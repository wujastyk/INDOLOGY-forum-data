Dear members of the list,

I am going to sojourn in Jaipur for a month in order to get ahead with my work on Jai Singh II. Does anyone have some advice about the people to meet there and, above all, about accommodation, nice and not too expensive, for such a long period. I'll be there with my family, varying from two to five persons.

Thanks for your help,
