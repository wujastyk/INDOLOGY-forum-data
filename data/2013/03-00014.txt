[INDOLOGY] Query
By devavar?a, they are probably referring to the Divine Year. The standard
description in the S?rya Siddh?nta and the Pur??as  is that an year for
human beings is one ahor?tra (day+night) for the gods.  Three hundred
ahoratras of gods make one *devavatsara, **divyavatsara *or *devavar?a*.
On the other hand, the Jupiter Year, according to the data given in the
S?rya Siddh?nta, is 361days, 0h 38mins.

Suresh.
