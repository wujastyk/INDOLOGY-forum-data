[INDOLOGY] Sacrificial Tortoise?
Well-known is the SB's description of the placing of a tortoise in the
first layer of the agnicayana (Eggeling's translation): "He then puts down
a (living) tortoise (kUrmaH);--the tortoise means life sap: it is life-sap
(blood) he thus bestows on Agni..." (the explanation continues on for about
ten sections -- SB 7.5.1.1 ff.)
