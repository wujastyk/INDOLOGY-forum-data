[INDOLOGY] Publication Announcement
Francois,
Please hop in. The phrase is that the one who has wrong view holds that: "natthi yi??ham natthi hutam". Since yittham and hutam are past participles, one could take this to mean that s/he believes that there is nothing sacrificed (yajayati) and nothing offered (pp. of juhati). But given the fact that (as Falk has demonstrated) several Pali sutras show a detailed knowledge of Vedic sacrifice, I see no reason not to assume that the wrong view indicated here is one that denies Vedic yajna and (agni)hotra.

Joseph,
Sorry to hop in this thread as a vedicist, but how would you (or your sources?) define "yajna" and "hotara".
Do you mean "sacrifice" (yaj;n;a-) and the "Hot.rs", i.e. officiants (from the plural hot;aara.h)?
