22nd Summer Sanskrit @ Harvard
Dear Michael,
I am delighted to see that Sanskrit survives at Harvard. Here in Toronto it is all but over. No first year at University of Toronto this year, and not likely next. A single 2nd year was/is offered this academic year with no suit to follow.The chair of my department (a Japanese historian from the US) forbade me to offer Advanced Sanskrit courses (a former student used to teach the 1st and 2nd years) if I couldn't have an enrolment of minimum 25 students. Have you ever seen a Advanced Sanskrit course with that number of students even in India?! We are now entirely a corporate university where only numbers, i.e. fees, count.
So I choose to retire. Effective January 1, this year.
Vive la libert?!
All the best
