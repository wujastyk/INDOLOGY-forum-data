Dear colleagues,
I would be very grateful if anyone in possession of a scanned copy of
Ramaswami Sastri's edition of Udbha?a's K?vy?la?k?ras?rasa?graha, no. 55 in
the Gaekwad's Oriental Series, the edition with the viv?ti of R?j?naka
Tilaka, would be willing to share it.  It is not available on Archive.org
(though the NSP edition is) or on Google Books, and the DLI seems to be
experiencing technical difficulties.
Thanks and best,
Whitney
