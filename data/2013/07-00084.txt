The company that runs our INDOLOGY server is doing some maintenance tonight:

During the (Central European) night of Wednesday, 7/17/2013 to Thursday,
7/18/2013 between 23.00 and 05:00 we are carrying out maintenance on the
host systems.  There may be interruptions in the availability of your
server during this period.

Email to and from the INDOLOGY discussion list should not be affected.

Best,
Dominik Wujastyk
