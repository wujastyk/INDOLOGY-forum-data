I am trying to track down a text that is alluded to in a late eighteenth
century essay by Henry Colebrooke as the ?Garland of Classes? (*Jaatimaala*).
It is, in his words, a chapter of* Rudra-yaamala-tantra*.

It is not clear from what *Rudra-yaamala-tantra* Colebrooke owned; a work
by that name does not appear in his extant collection of manuscripts.
Current scholarly consensus on the *Rudra-yaamala-tantra* suggests that,
though routinely cited as an important text in the Kaula Tantric tradition,
the ?original? text is lost. There is a version of a text with the same
name has been published in a Sanskrit edition by the Vacasampati Press,
Calcutta. However, it does not contain a *Jaatimaala* chapter.

Can anybody shed light on the nature or whereabouts of this elusive chapter?


Many thanks

Laura Harrington
