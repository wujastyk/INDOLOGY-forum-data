[INDOLOGY] question for European Indologists
In Goettingen we used Stenzler. Here in Oso I use Maurer, who also
starts with Nala as a first text, though in the exercises he mainly uses
the Bhagavadg?t?.

U. of Brussels in the late 1950's, he used vol. 2 (the anthology part)
by Thumb and Hauschild, with notes and vocabulary in German, to
introduce us to Sanskrit texts. It includes Nala 1-5. As you will
appreciate, it worked well.

Sanskrit Reader was, for a century or more, the de facto standard for
beginning Sanskrit students (this has changed only in recent decades
with the appearance of Goldman and Goldman, Scharf, Hock, etc). 
Is there an equivalent introductory text that was used in Europe
(Stenzler?) Do European Sanskrit students also work with Nala as a first
text (which I know is found in Bopp, Boehtlink, Monier-Williams,
Stenzler, and Lanman)? 
anecdotal evidence here; any comments will help. --
