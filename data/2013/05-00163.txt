[INDOLOGY] Help
Dear Patrick, in the second quote, read ?kto instead of ukto. I could  
not trace the exact source, but this is about the pr?ya?citta mantras,  
bh?r in the case of the RV, bhuva? in the case of the YV, svar in the  
case of the SV, and bh?r bhuva? svar if it not known which Veda is  
concerned. Cf. AB 5,32; KB 6,12; ??S 3,21,1-6; ??v?S 1,12,31-33. Best  
regards, Asko
