With  thanks to Professor Hari Dutt Sharma and Dr Sthaneshwar  
Timalsina I am able to send you the next issue of Vi-duu. I hope you  
will enjoy it again.

It was ready on 1st October but am able to send it only now. The  
members of the IASS have already seen it, so apologies for the  
duplication.

With best wishes,

Jay Soni
