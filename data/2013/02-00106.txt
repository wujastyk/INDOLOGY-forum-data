[INDOLOGY] ma.n.dalakramavid- in B.rhatsa.mhitaa
Dear Members of the List,
A verse of Varaahamihira's B.rhatsa.mhitaa (60.19; 59.19 in Tripathi's 1968 ed.) quoted by Michael Willis (Archaeology of Hindu Ritual, p. 132) contains the following pada: 
maat.r.naam api ma.n.dalakramavido
Willis translates "ma.n.dalakramavido" as: "those who know the rites of the ma.n.dala" (op. cit., p. 134). 
The only commentary of this verse accesible to me, that of Bha.t.totpala in Tripathi's ed., renders "ma.n.dalakramavido" as: 
ma.n.dalakramavido ye ma.n.dalakrama.m puujaakrama.m vidanti jaananti 
and I guess that "puujaa?" in "puujaakrama.m" has influenced Willis' translation by "rites of the ma.n.dala", because I have never seen "krama-" in the sense of "rite" anywhere, nor is this meaning attested in the MW or PW.
I was wondering 
1) if someone could give me the opinion of other commentators than Bha.t.totpala's on the compound "ma.n.dalakramavido",
2) if anyone has a clear idea of what these "knowers of the ma.n.dalakrama" were actually.
Many thanks in advance,
