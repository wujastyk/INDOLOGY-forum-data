Another Query
     Does anyone have access to a scanned pdf copy of the GOS edition of
the Tattvasa?graha with Pa?jik??  I have the Dwarikad?sa Shastri's edition,
but not the GOS edition.  I believe that Jha's translation of the
Tattvasa?graha was based on the GOS edition of the text, or is there an
older edition of the Sanskrit text?
