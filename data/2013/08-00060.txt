Subject: [INDOLOGY] Email for Rangachar Vasantha?
Message-ID: <8c78278c16fbf7fea11e3f13f3a3bf03@fabularasa.dk>

Dear list,

I am trying to contact art and board game historian Rangachar Vasantha. 
The only email I can find for her is venkata at hd2.dot.net.in which 
apparently is not in use anymore.

Does anyone here have a more recent email address for her?

Kind regards,
Jacob
