[INDOLOGY] "vIraka"
I can only direct your attention to Don Handelman's and David Shulman's "God Inside Out: ?iva's Game of Dice", New York, etc. 1997, pp. 155-157 (the first two pages are included in books.google), also pp. 128, 129.  A member of ?iva's entourage, V?raka was adopted byP?rvat? as her son (MatsyaP). Regarding the iconographic question, I personally have not come across any character described asV?raka so far.

I haven't got a reference for it, but I have a distant memory of seeing it used in South Indian iconography as the name of a member of ?iva's entourage - possibly Nandin in human form with a bull's head?
