It requires scientists to submit final peer-reviewed journal manuscripts that arise from NIH funds to the digital archive PubMed Central upon acceptance for publication.  To help advance science and improve human health, the Policy requires that these papers are accessible to the public on PubMed Central no later than 12 months after publication." http://publicaccess.nih.gov/

The Austrian FWF, which is the national research funding body for Austria, has a similar all-encompassing Open Access policy for publications arising out of the research it funds, but in the FWF's case the policy extends also to mongraphs.  I fail to see how this can possibly work, especially for books that might fall into the trade category.  But it's a nice idea.
