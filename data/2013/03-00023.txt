Subject: [INDOLOGY] Demise of Professor Mudumbi Narasimhachary

I am very sorry to learn of Prof. Narasimhachary's passing.  I only met him
once, at a conference on manuscriptology in Chennai, where he delivered
what (given the conference's subject matter) proved to be a remarkably
moving keynote address on the eve of America's invasion of Iraq.

I have, quite coincidentally, just been reading his edition and study of
Y?muna's ?gamapr?m??yam, which is a model of careful scholarship.  R.I.P.
