Subject: [INDOLOGY] question for European Indologists

There is also a Croatian translation of Stenzler's grammar, and I believe it is still used by the colleagues in Zagreb. 

It might be added that Stenzler's book sold so well after it came out in 1868 that for the first time in his life Stenzler managed to make some money (he was already 61 years old then). Guess what he did with it ? he established a foundation that rewarded a yearly scholarship to outstanding Sanskrit students at his university!

Best wishes,
Sven

> A propos Elisa's comment on Stenzler, for the sake of completeness it should be pointed out that there is an English translation of his "Primer of the Sanskrit Language", made by Renate Sohnen-Thieme and published by the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London (1st edn 1992, 2nd revised edn 1997). It was used in elementary Sanskrit classes at SOAS at least while Dr Sohnen-Thieme was teaching them. The preface to the second edition mentions (p. vi) that "The English edition published in 1992 has been warmly welcomed in various parts of the world."
