[INDOLOGY] "On the Literature of the Hindus" ?
I have been reading the 1791 essay "On the Literature of the Hindus" (sometimes attributed to Wiliam Jones, but seems to be by Govardhan Caul). The first part of it seems to be a translation of a Sanskrit text that, at least in the French version of the same essay, the translator renders "Science universelle pratique & speculative." Does anyone know what text he is translating?
Cheers,
