Query
This verse, in both its close variants, is a remarkably strong endorsement of local adaptation, a Sanskrit  "when in Rome?"   I would be grateful for any information on the context of this statement, i.e. what if anything is at stake. Also, do we find similar claims elsewhere, and does such advocacy ever attempt to explicitly refute or harmonize with strong, apparently countervailing, universalist claims based on 'sanatana-dharma', a broad brahminical aitihya, or other authorities?
	Sincere thanks for any help with this,
Howard Resnick
