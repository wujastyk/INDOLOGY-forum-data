Dear colleagues,

Since we seem to have reached a safe explanation for the syntactical problem discussed, I write this one just for thanking you all for the suggestions.

best wishes

I tracked this carefully a number of years ago, and though I don't have hard numbers, I would say that the inverse is the case at least 90%  of the time or more: vai marks the predicate in a nominal sentence, i.e., X vai Y = Y is X.
