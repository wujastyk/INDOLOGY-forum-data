>From a phenomenological perspective I am interested in exploring how to
possibly  operationalise such a practice into my current ethnographic
research in an ashram in Gujarat. Or at least become more familiar with the
foundation of the practice from a historical and textual perspective, as it
seems to be a prominent component  of this community's epistemological
framework. The acaryas here are also at a loss to define what the etymology
of the 'dreer' might be. At a first glance the head acaryas seem to support
the possibility of it being sAkSIndriya. However, we continue with our
investigation. Prof Bhattacharya's mention of the vedAntaparibhASA and
nyAyakoza may help in our endeavour. I would appreciate copies of these
texts if they are available in pdf.

Moreover, as a participant observer, I am exploring ways to perhaps improve
upon Bourdieu's concept of the 'participant objectified' in which he
asserts, allows for the required epistemological break, by objectifying the
participant through taking a rarefied step back, in what sounds somewhat
similar to the practice of the silent witness, or at least reminds myself
of the practice.

Even though the intended  results between the sociology of Bourdieu  and
practice of witness consciousness may be different it is interesting to
think about the possibilities and similarities. Or, perhaps, it exposes my
ignorance on both topics?
