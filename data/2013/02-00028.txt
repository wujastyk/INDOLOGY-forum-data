In the Tattvasa?grahapa?jika I find the term visar?ru. It clearly means
something like "flowing forth continuously," but I do not find it in the lexicons at my 
disposal (I'm away from my library just now) and I can't work out the derivation,
except of course that it's from vi-s? > visara "going forth". 

It's not, by the way, to be found in Edgerton's BHS dictionary, or in Apte, or in Monier-Williams,
which I do have packed into my tablet.

Thanks in advance for your suggestions.
