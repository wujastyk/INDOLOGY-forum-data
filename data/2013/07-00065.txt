Thanks for all the replies. Dipak?s mention of the Mudr?r?k?asa is dated at the 4th century CE at the earliest. The word for cloth he mentions is the same one I was interested in: pa?a.

 

Joseph pushes it a bit farther back to the first or second century CE, although that?s still a bit later than what I was hoping for.

 

It may be I'll have to translate it only as 'cloth' and not 'canvas'.

 

Best,

 

Dean
