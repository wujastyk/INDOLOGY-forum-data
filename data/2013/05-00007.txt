[INDOLOGY] Fwd: New Book on Food Culture in Mumbai
Hi Whitney!
I don't know anything about this book, but I know that an eminent 
scholar in German literature is publishing with Open Book, and that they 
seem to have a distinguished editorial board.  So, all power to them for 
working for Open Access publishing.
A little bird told me that congratulations to you may be in order. Here 
are mine and Ludo's.
All best wishes to you and your family,
Rosane
