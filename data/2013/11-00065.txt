[INDOLOGY] Lamentations
I think there is a lamentation tradition in Buddhism -- vil?pa. You find such a lament in nice in the Buddhacarita where there are two laments by the wife and mother. The Ya?odhar? lament has come into Sinhala, and Ranjini Obeyesekere has published a book on it: Yasodaravata: The Story of Yasodara or Yasodara's Lament. Colombo: Godage International Publishers, 2005.
