T
?his is a long shot, but is anyone aware of a good scan of Turner's CDIAL?
I know about the searchable transcript at http://dsal.uchicago.edu, and
there are some very poor-quality scans at DLI, of only some fascicles (1-3,
5-11) of the early edition of the 1960s.?  These are sometimes illegible.
I've looked elsewhere (bookfi.org, Google Books (scanned but not available)
archive.org, scribd).  It's still in copyright, of course, so scans
shouldn't be circulating, strictly speaking.

Best,
Dominik
