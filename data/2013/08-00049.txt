Dear Jim,
according to my notes, some early references about female gait resembling that of an elephant include Bhavabh?ti MM 9, 27, Dh?rtavi?asa?v?da after 16, P?dat??itaka 88, Kum?rad?sa J?nak?h. 1, 29, and Manu 3, 10. For male, princely gait already in the R?m?ya?a (e.g. 1, 47, 2 and 2, 38, 6). In 3, 44, 18f.  S?t??s thigh is smooth as an elephant?s trunk.  
Best,
Klaus
