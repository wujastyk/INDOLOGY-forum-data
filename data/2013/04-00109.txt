Yes, indeed it is a plum, Prunus domestica. Indian Medicinal Plants  (Ed. by  the Arya Vaidya Sala, Kottakkal , Orient Longman 1995)  vol 4, p. 356 says it grows in Himachal Pradesh and the Nilgiris.
"Parts used: fruits
Properties and uses: The fruits are sweet, laxative, refrigerant, appetising, stomachic (sic!) digestive and tonic. They are useful in vitiated conditions of pitta, dipsia (whatever that is), nausea, flatulence, colic, dyspepsia and debility."
Hopefully the poor cakora is just enjoying the taste... like the rest of us.
Best to all
Stella Sandahl

It is supposedly used medicinally, and the St. Pete's has it as growing in the Himalayas, but I have come across it in B??a's description of the Punjabi (now Haryana) region called ?r?ka??ha. In that description it (or most likely its seed, nut, fruit?) is being pecked at by a chukar partridge (cakora).  The phrase is: cakoraca?cujarjarit?ruka. B?htlingk and Roth, following the ?abdakalpadruma, assign it the synonyms v?r?ruka and v?rasena. The Hindi ?abdas?gar says it has a cooling effect. I simply would like to know what it is more precisely that this bird is pecking at.
