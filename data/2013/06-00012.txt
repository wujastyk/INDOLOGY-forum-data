[INDOLOGY] Garuda Purana
Thanks Michael for sharing the fruits of your toil behind the lens.  I have taken the liberty of making a smaller but still crisp file (26 MB), for those of us who are budgeting space on the drive. It can be found here:

Re: [INDOLOGY] Garuda Purana
Dear Ken and anyone interested,
I took photos of this 1890 edition you seek and they are compiled as a PDF at the following link: <http://garudam.info/files/GP-1890.pdf>.  It is a rather large file at 300 MB.
Best,
