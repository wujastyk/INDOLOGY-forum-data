Right! But they surely mentioned the author's name. What happens elsewhere is different. There is one Cosmo Publishers with office (main?) in Delhi. They published something like an encyclopaedia of the tantras. The fourth chapter of a 1984 publication of mine was copied and printed therein without my name even once being mentioned. Some friend consoled me that it proved at least that my work had some value. 
Even celebrated authors do not escape being plagiarized. Satavalekar is a well-known name to Vedic scholars. A firm in Delhi is reprinting his works in their name even before 6o years (copyright limit according to Indian law) passed after his death. Examples will be a legion.
But I refrain from mentioning them
Best
