[INDOLOGY] Two quotes
Dear Colleagues
There are two fine quotations that I have in my mind, but I cannot locate the original sources. The sense of the quotes is as follows:
1. an English quote: to be Hindu is to be pur??ic (i.e. pur??ic discourses are at the heart of contemporary Hindu beliefs and practices)
2. a Sanskrit ?loka:  worms/bugs/grubs/insects (which consume MSS) have a great appetite for Sanskrit literature
