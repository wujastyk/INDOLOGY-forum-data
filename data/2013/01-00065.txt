Mystery palm leaf MSS
Dear colleagues
This rather handsome palm-leaf MSS turned up in a tea-chest that belonged to an elderly deceased relative and had probably not been touched for 50 years or more. My guess is that it is Sinhala. I am hoping that one of you fine folk can read it or point me to someone who can.
