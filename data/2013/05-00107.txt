Thank you for this information. I may not have given the best variant of the text. 
Clearly, as you point out, this statement is literally describing "correct" seeing, rather than mandating a term of address.
That being the case, do we know why and when statements like this were deployed to justify 'mata/mataji' as the appropriate way to address (and think about) a lady, or even a girl in many cases. I wonder if anyone noticed or remarked that this custom was apparently at variance with forms of address found in influential shastras, such as itihasa-purana.

In the verse I have seen the locatives are given as accusatives: m?t?vat parad?ra? ca etc. Also the last p?da, as I remember it runs: ya? pa?yati sa pa?yati -- one who sees (this way), truly sees.
