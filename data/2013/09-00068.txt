Dear colleagues,
Please see the call for paper below:


Fauna, flora and minerals in South Asian Religions and Culture
The study and understanding of the complex relation between human beings and the environment is central for the appreciation of religion and culture. With debates on eco-theology and environmentalism now being very much part of the academic discourse, we are preparing a three-volume collection providing an opportunity to reflect on, promote and contribute to the study of fauna, flora and minerals in South Asian religious narratives, beliefs, practices, performances, arts and science. The project is articulated in three parts:

Volume 1: Charming Beauties and Frightful Beasts. Non-Human Animals in South Asian Myth, Ritual and Folklore<https://www.equinoxpub.com/equinox/books/showbook.asp?bkid=543> (Sheffield and Bristol, CT: Equinox, 2013).

Volume 2: Roots of Wisdom, Branches of Devotion. Plant Life in South Asian Religions and Culture (Sheffield and Bristol, CT: Equinox, expected to be published by 2015).

Volume 3: Soulless Matter, Seats of Energy. Metals, Gems and Minerals in South Asian Religions and Culture (Sheffield and Bristol, CT: Equinox, expected to be published by 2015).

Volume 1 will be out in a few weeks.

The editors invite contributions to Volume 2 (flora) and Volume 3 (minerals, gems, metals).

Possible themes for a chapter include:

-          minerals, metals and plants in South Asian literatures;

-          the belief that divine beings inhabit or are associated to particular plants and/or rocks, minerals and stones (including mountains);

-          debates on the concept of animate and inanimate matter in South Asian traditions; plants and minerals as a resource for South Asian material culture;

-          the use of metals, stones and gems in the production of coins, medals, seals, amulets, etc.;

-          the use of wood, rocks or metals in the preparation of icons and/or ritual tools;

-          the threat posed by industrialisation and population increase to the vegetable and mineral resources of sacred areas;

-          the study of myth, ritual and folklore as sources for ecological projects, ?green? education, ecological consciousness, eco-sustainably and responsible management of resources;

-          metals and minerals in the production of weaponry, amulets, ornaments and ritual implements;

-          the preparation of remedies from plants and/or minerals in medical systems such as Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani Tibb, Tibetan and Tantric medicine, etc.;

-          folk remedies in South Asian vernacular and indigenous traditions;

-          use of drugs and intoxicants in religious narratives and ritual practices;

-          the social aspects of tea, coffee and/or tobacco in South Asia;

-          vegetarian/vegan food in South Asian cuisines;

-          the relation between community, agriculture and religion;

-          plant life and minerals/metals in relation to issues of purity and auspiciousness.

The editors invite chapter proposals reflecting the cultural and religious diversity of South Asia and are particularly eager to consider contributions exploring discourses on plant life and minerals/gems/metals from South Asian countries other than India.

Chapters will be 7,000 words long (including bibliography and endnotes) and should be submitted by Friday 4 July 2014.

We invite potential contributors to send a title, an abstract (max 500 words) and a short biographical note (150 words) to the editors off list by Monday 14 October 2013.

Many thanks
