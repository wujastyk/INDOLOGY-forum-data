This description of ?aivas in some texts is paralleled by similar treatment
of Vai??avas in several texts.  Recently, Rosalind O'Hanlon of Oxford gave
a paper on some J?tinir?aya texts where the Vai??avas are also listed as
having a very low status.  All these kinds of descriptions simply reflect
sectarian animosities, and simply point to a fact that there was no
comprehensive standardization of such categories in the name of a unified
Hinduism.
