Dear list,
I am searching for a copy of the Kr???kau?alya section (6.20) of 
Harik???a Vyan?kat?ara?ma S?arma?'s Br?hajjyotis?a?rn?ava from 1871. The 
entire work was published by Venkateshwar Steam Press in 1900, and a 
Sanskrit/Hindi version of the Kr???kau?alya section was published by Nag 
Publishers in 1982, but I have been unable to procure copies - digital 
or otherwise - of any of them.
Any help in locating this work will be much appreciated.
Kind regards,
Jacob
