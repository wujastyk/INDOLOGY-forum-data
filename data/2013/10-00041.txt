[INDOLOGY] "GRETIL ALL" archive, 2013-10-09
Dear list members,
occasionally, newcomers to GRETIL ask how they can build up a personal archive of e-texts on their hard disk for convenient "global search" ("grep") etc. To save them the trouble of having to download hundreds of individual files, a zipped archive of the presently 1,578 UTF-8 (Unicode) files is now made available for download:
http://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil/GRETIL_ALL_2013-10-09_UTF8_FOR_PERSONAL_USE_ONLY.zip
Please, note that this archive is intended for personal use only.
Regards,
Reinhold Gr?nendahl
