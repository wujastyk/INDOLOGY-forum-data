[INDOLOGY] Modernity
Friends~
I am doing a shsort piece on Modernity and the Hindu Mind. 
Is it right to say that Modernity (as understood as a state of being and not as modernisation) requires  the acceptance of: 
a break in tradition, 
the rise of the individual, 
democracy as a social and political norm,  
the strict separation of state and religion 
and above all the uncertaintly of knowledge.
I would appreciate your thoughts on this.
Regards.
Prof. Harsha V. Dehejia
