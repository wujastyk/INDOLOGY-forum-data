I wish to read

   - Daya Krishna, "Pata?jali's Yogas?tra: The Undeciphered text ?
   Anomalies, Problems and Paradoxes."

It is a chapter in Krishna's book, *Indian Philosophy: A Counter Perspective
*, Sri Satguru Publications, 2006.  I just bought this book, but I received
the 1992 edition, which doesn't have the Pata?jali essay. Apparently this
essay was added only in the 2006 edition.  Neither edition of the book is
available in the Vienna libraries.

If anyone has a digital copy of the Pata?jali essay, I'd be very grateful
for a copy.

Best,
Dominik
