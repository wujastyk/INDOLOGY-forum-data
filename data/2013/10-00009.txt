[INDOLOGY] Publication Announcement (Prof K.C. Pandey Centenary	Volume)
Dear Elisa,
I am sorry for the delay caused in getting back to you about the table of contents of the above mentioned volume. Actually, I had requested Prof Navjivan Rastogi if he could make the contents of this volume available to us. He sent to me the scanned copy of the TOC which I am enclosing herewith. However, I note that the contents of the first part are missing. I am assuming the first part deals with the life and works of Professor K.C. Pandey. I hope this is useful to the students of Abhinavagupta.
Yours,
Mrinal Kaul
