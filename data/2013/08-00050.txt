HI Jim
Thought perhaps not directly relevant, Apte's Dictionary lists under
Hastini a quote from the Ratimanjari, a text from the Kamashastra tradition
which includes a description of the classic types of women lovers.
Ratimanjari 8 describes the 'elephant-like' woman.  Here's a possible
translation of the quote:  "With thick womb, thick buttocks and lips, thick
fingers, thick breasts, amiable, eager for love, delighting in intense
sexual passion, a tremendous eater, (unusually short), indeed the hastini
is, she is considered the female elephant."
The other three classic Kamashastra types are Shankini, Citrini and
Rupini.
These same typologies appear in some of the Buddhist tantras, with
sometimes amusing, relatively unflattering male yogi versions to match.
See for example Kalacakratantra/Vimalaprabha, Abhishekapatala vss 138-144,
wherein the 'Elephant' yogi is described as a passionate lover who also
moves slowly, is extremely foolish, and has a putrid smell.
Cheers
