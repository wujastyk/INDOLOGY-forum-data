=?utf-8?Q?Re:_[INDOLOGY]_Epigraphia_Carnatica_Digitization_Project_-_T=C3=BCbingen?=
Thank you for you comment and for the suggestion. I have already spoken with the responsible of the Library. All the scans of the volumes (1st edition and some of the 2nd edition which in some cases entail different districts- total: 30 volumes) and this "first-level" cataloging have been done with internal resources.  I am waiting for them to decide if they are willing to apply for some founding in order to have at least the transliteration in the searchable form. 
Your email, as well as that of Andrew Ollet, is of great help in trying to convince them.
I?ll contact Dr. Schmiedchen and I?ve already written to Dr. Voegeli who has worked on Epigraphia Indica: I would like to try to organize a workshop here in T?bingen summoning the people who works to bring Indological texts into the digital age (as, e.g., the Sanskrit Manuscript Project in Cambridge as well as Bhasa Project). 
Any help and advise are really most welcomed,
Best Wishes
