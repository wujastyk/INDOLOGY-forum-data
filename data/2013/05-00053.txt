Subject: [INDOLOGY] Brill acquires the Forsten Indology list

dear Friends,

I resisted getting into this, but sometimes a little knowledge does not
hurt. Egbert Forsten is getting older. He has run his publishing house by
himself, and finding himself no longer able to do so, he looked for a home
in which he was assured that his standards would be upheld. As far as I
know (and in fact I do know a bit about this) there is nothing sinister of
the matsyany?ya variety going on here. (And anyone who thinks that buying
up indological publishers will make them money is in for a rude awakening.)
As far as Brill's prices go, well, they are a business, but... have you
tried to buy a book from anyplace like the Bayerische Academy lately? They
have huge subventions, I imagine, but still manage to ask impressive
prices. And try to buy an academic book from Japan please. American and
British academic books are usually published by University presses or
societies, and thus heavily subvented, so the prices are kept down.
I confess that I am not entirely neutral here, as I am involved with
several projects with Brill, including a journal and an encyclopedia among
others. But the reality is that niche markets don't allow for economies of
scale.
There are, to be sure, serious questions about the economics of academic
publications, but it would help if these were carried out with more facts
and less wild speculation.

apologies for the (sort of) rant, jonathan
