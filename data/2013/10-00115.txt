[INDOLOGY] was "Question for European Indologists"
Dear colleague,
Yes, of course, the Gonda manual is the one you translated from the original German. I referred to it, without giving your name, since Christophe Vielle had done it in his message dated 4th July, to which I answered yesterday. Allow me to say that you can be proud of it.
And, of course, I teach devana?gari? in my grammatical seminar in EPHE, all the more so as the seminars I dedicate to S?aiva texts consists in reading Sanskrit texts in their original edition; for instance, the texts from the Kashmir Series of Texts and Studies.
Best regards,
