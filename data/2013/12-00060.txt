But, Joseph,
"The Nastika is one who denies the existence of karma and the efficacy of yajna and hotara"
surely implies that Buddhists were n?stika-s in the sense that they did deny the efficacy of the
Vedic sacrificial cult.
As i recall, however, Kamala??la, in the TSP, does take the Buddhists and Brahmanical traditions
to be both ?stika-s in that they both affirm the doctrines of karma and mok?a.
I find it easier to make sense of these shifting uses of ?stika and n?stika if we understand the terms not
as fixed categories of types of believers, but in their literal sense as meaning "yeah-sayers" and "nay-sayers".
The precise usage may then be allowed to shift according to just what the yeah or nay are about in
any given context. Of course, a more or less fixed use did set in, but as you've all rightly suggested,
this was a relatively late development.
best,
Matthew
