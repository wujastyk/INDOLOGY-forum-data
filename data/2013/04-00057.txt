Vedic as?'rta-, s?'rta-, as?ry?-, as?r?-
by
Marcos Albino
ABSTRACT
In this paper I try to show that Vedic as?'rta is an extended exocentric compound based on sv?r/s?'r ?sun?, that it is not a negative formation with the ?possessive? suffix ?ta, and that s?'rta is a decompositional formation.
I also propose that Ved. as?ry?, too, is an extended exocentric compound. Further, I propose that Ved. as?r? is an ?absence? formation of the type arajj?u ?without rope.?
