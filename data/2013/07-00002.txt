Subject: [INDOLOGY] question for European Indologists
Message-ID: <CABOsp66C7Cb4pjczFWW7zbmgukgtDqMS2i2s7DOQiDMUheuaXQ@mail.gmail.com>

Following up on Victor's post on Lanman's personal copy of the Reader, i
can confirm that that is indeed Lanman's handwriting in the back, having
done some work with his personal papers.

Also of note in this version of the book is a brief bibliographical section
on pages xvii - xx, entitled "A Brief List of Books for Students of
Sanskrit", which, as far as i know, was quietly left out of many later
printings of the book. It is, however, noteworthy, in that Lanman there
gives his concise appraisal of each book's pedagogical value.

Should Dominik or else anyone else who cannot access this online book wish
to see it, i'm happy to forward on the pdf.
