Have you tried ordering it, say from Motilal Banarsidass in Delhi?

Also, the Library of Congress online catalog lists this and two other translations sub titulo Gadyatraya.? You could try requesting them by interlibrary loan though that might take quite a while.? 

Also, one of the three titles is available used on Amazon.com for USD 67.
