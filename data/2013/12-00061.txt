[INDOLOGY] Publication Announcement
Dear Andrew,
I just wanted to point out, in case you haven?t considered it, R?ja?ekhara?s (early tenth C.) discussion of anv?k?ik? in his K?vyam?m??s? chapter 2, in which he states that the p?rvapak?a consists of ?Jain and Buddhist schools, as well as the Lok?yatas (arhadbhadantadar?ane lok?yata? ca)? while the uttarapak?a consists of ?S??khya and Ny?ya-Vai?e?ika (s??khya? ny?yavai?e?ikau).? 
Seems to me to be a clear binary (and hierarchical) distinction between the two groups, though admittedly it?s in the realm of logical debate (tarka) rather than belief/religion. But perhaps there is something to it?
All best wishes,
Adheesh
