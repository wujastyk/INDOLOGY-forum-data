It is to be note that Gelongma Migme Ch?dr?n's translation from Lamotte has not the right to be published. 
The extract below is not concerned, nor copies of the whole translation in private sharing, but the work is made available illegally at:
http://fr.scribd.com/doc/54581347/The-Treatise-on-the-Great-Virtue-of-Wisdom2

http://fr.scribd.com/doc/53288920/Maha-prajnaparamita-sastra-Vol-1-by-Nagarjuna

http://fr.scribd.com/doc/116837742/46671115-Maha-Prajnaparamita-Sastra-Vol-5-by-Nagarjuna    

Following what it is declared at  http://www.gampoabbey.org/translation-committee.php,
I am interested to know if the vol. 2-4 are also available on web-sites, and the same for 
the Mahaayaanasa.mgraha (PIOL 8),
or the translation of Van den Broeck's translation of the Am.rtarasa (PIOL 15).

Best wishes,

> "Relying on the meaning (arthapratisara?a), since goodwill or malice, defect or merit, falsity or truth, cannot be attributed to meaning. It is the letter (vya?jana) that indicates the meaning (artha), but the meaning is not the letter. Suppose a man points his finger at the moon to people who doubt the moon's presence; if these doubters fixate on the finger but do not look at the moon, this man tells them: "I am pointing to the moon with my finger so that you may notice the moon. Why do you fixate on my finger instead of looking at the moon?"  It is the same here: the letter (vya?jana) is the finger pointing to the meaning (artha), but the letter is not the meaning. This is why one should not rely on the letter."

> I don't know of any Sanskrit texts offhand that make that claim in Nagarjuna's name, but the Dazhidu lun (WG: Ta chih-tu lun), translated by Kum?raj?va into Chinese in the first decade of the fifth century which he attributes to Nagarjuna (it is considered a commentary on the Praj??p?ramit? s?tra), contains that line three times: Twice at T 25.1509.125a29-b5, and then once again at T.25.1509.726a2-3.
>  
> Aside from Nagarjuna attributions, one also finds that line in all three Chinese trs. of the La?k?vat?ra s?tra:
>  
> by Gu?abhadra (tr between 435-443 CE): T.16.670.510c17
> by Bodhiruci (513 CE): T.16.671.557a20
> by ?ik??nanda (ca. 700 CE): T.16.672.620a15
>  
> It is also found in Gu?abhadra's tr. of the A?gulim?l?ya s?tra (tr between 435-443), T.2.20.537a11-12 (Yangjuemolo jing)
>  
> Dan Lusthaus

> Does anyone have the exact text reference for the statement attributed to Nagarjuna that one should look to the moon, not the finger pointing to the moon? In other words, the words of the teaching are not the same as their realization.
