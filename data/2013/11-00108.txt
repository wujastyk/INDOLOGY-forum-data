[INDOLOGY] dvandvas
Traditionally, anekam of anekam anyapad?rthe (A???dhy?y? 2.2.24), first stated after 2.2.23: ?e?o bahuvr?hi?, is considered to recur in 2.2.29: c?rthe dvandva?, so that a dvandva can be formed from any number of padas; cf. K??ik? 2.2.29: anekam iti vartate |aneka? subanta? c?rthe vartam?na? samasyate ... There does not, therefore, appear to be a binary bracketing.  Regards, George
