Dear Liverpool Indology list members,


it is not clear to me how many of the 453 signatories of the letter 
drafted by Sheldon Pollock and sent to OUP have received a message from 
Rachel Goode (as Joanna Kirpatrick has).
[I don't think I received anything]

I believe the members of Liverpool Indology
who were signatories of the protest letter but have not been directly 
informed of the recent development will be interested in seeing this,
which I forward from the Indo-Eurasian mailing list.

Best wishes

Wow! Lovely! Marvelous to see this. Living in India, I had begun to 
doubt the efficacy of quiet, sensible intelligent protesting.
