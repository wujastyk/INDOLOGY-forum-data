Fwd: Re: [Indo-Eurasia] FW: A.K. Ramanujan's "Three Hundred              Ramayanas" and "Collected Essays"
Dear Liverpool Indology list members,
it is not clear to me how many of the 453 signatories of the letter 
drafted by Sheldon Pollock and sent to OUP have received a message from 
Rachel Goode (as Joanna Kirpatrick has).
[I don't think I received anything]
I believe the members of Liverpool Indology
who were signatories of the protest letter but have not been directly 
informed of the recent development will be interested in seeing this,
which I forward from the Indo-Eurasian mailing list.
Best wishes

Wow! Lovely! Marvelous to see this. Living in India, I had begun to 
doubt the efficacy of quiet, sensible intelligent protesting.
