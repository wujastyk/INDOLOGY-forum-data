On Sanskrit in China, colleagues might be interested in reading selections from the autobiography of China's premier Sanskritist, Prof. Ji Xianlin (1911-2009):

It is of some interest to compare the current lamentable situation in regard to Sanskrit education in India with the
considerable flourishing of interest at major Chinese
universities, including Beijing University, Renmin
University, and Fudan University, among others. I have heard of introductory enrollments topping 60 in some cases.
And the interest of Chinese students of Sanskrit is
by no means limited to Buddhism, as one might have
predicted, but now embraces kaavya, epic, and philosophical
subjects. Although it is only tangentially related, as in
the West, one may note that China is in the midst
of a burgeoning yoga-craze as well.
