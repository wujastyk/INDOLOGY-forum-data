FW: [INDOLOGY] What is the writing on the attached image?
?A quick web search shows that there is at least one author (B. Indraji, 
1876, is generally cited) who proposed that Panini invented the Brahmi 
system of writing numerals.

Indeed !
The diagram in the background, behind the writing Panini, has the general
look as a jyoti?a j?taka or horoscope chart, but with the Br?hm? numerals in
the 12 positions, instead of the zodiac.  And what's that sun doing in the
top right corner?
