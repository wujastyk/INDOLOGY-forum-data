Hello Madhav,

There is also a variant at AVZ 10.8.29 that may be if interest.

Dear Colleagues,

    The very popularly recited mantra "p?r?am ada? p?r?am idam.." occurs as the beginning ??ntimantra for the ???v?sya-Upani?ad.  It came to me as a surprise that Bloomfield's Vedic concordance does not list this among the mantras, nor does Jacob's Concordance of the Upanishads list it.  I was equally surprised that most published editions of the ???v?sya-Upani?ad do not begin with this mantra, but, as expected, they begin with the mantra: ??? v?syam idam ...   Among the editions I have consulted, only the ?nand??rama (Pune) edition of the ???v?sya-Upani?ad with ???karabh??ya offers this mantra before the text of the Upani?ad proper, but ?a?kara does not comment on it, nor does any other commentary that I have seen comment on it.  I am wondering if anyone has seen any research relating to the antiquity of this mantra.  I would be most happy to receive any information on this subject.  Best,

Madhav
