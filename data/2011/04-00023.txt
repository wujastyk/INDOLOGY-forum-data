Subject: Persian and Arabic borrowings in Sanskrit

Many thanks to all who responded to my query so far. I have consulted 
Weber's work, and now find that I need to qualify my original question 
somewhat.

Weber (1887: 21) gives a list of Sanskritization of Persian phonemes in 
the P?ras?prak??a (c. 1600). However, this list does not quite tally 
with the examples I have seen in Sanskrit astrological works dating 
(probably) from the 13th century or earlier. One obvious possible 
explanation is that pronunciation had changed over the intervening 
centuries.

My modified question, therefore, must be: what are the earliest 
documented examples (preferably lists) of Sanskritized Persian or Arabic 
words after, say, 1000 CE?

Vidvajjanaday?p?tram,
