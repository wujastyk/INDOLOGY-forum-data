Porunthal: dating of paddy in the 5th century B.C. and              possible consequences on the evaluation of the history of writing              in India
I add ...
Dear Ms. Wessels-Mevissen,
AND .... You should have the courage to challenge that "well known  
archeologist" ... if you felt that his belief in your support of his  
research was fake/unfair. :-)
++++++++++++++++++++++
Respected Colleagues,
Yes, please ... whether you are an old timer or a "new kid on the  
block" ... kindly avoid making sweeping, flippant, unsubstantiated  
remarks about any culture/language you study, especially when it is  
not pertinent to the topic under focus.
Thanks and regards,
V.S. Rajam
