Subject: FYI: Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies              (JIABS): new website and free online access to journal content
Message-ID: <161227094389.23782.11886246227222094713.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear colleagues (apologies for cross-posting),

the Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies (JIABS, 
ISSN: 0193-600X) has a new website, hosted by the University Library of 
Heidelberg:

http://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/ojs/index.php/jiabs/index

The website offers full and free online access to the journal. Tables of 
contents are available for all issues; articles are made available 60 
months after their appearance in print.

Currently issues 1 (1978) to 28/2 (2005) are fully accessible, and 
searchable. Articles published up to 1999 have been scanned and run 
through automatic OCR - full-text search is therefore possible, but 
limited especially when it comes to transliterations of Asian languages. 
For more recent articles the journal's production files are used. The 
website also offers RSS and Atom feeds.

The Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies (ISSN 
0-193-600XX) is the organ of the International Association of Buddhist 
Studies. The JIABS welcomes scholarly contributions in all areas of 
Buddhist Studies. A double-blind peer-review process is used to ensure 
the high academic quality of all contributions.

With best regards,

Birgit Kellner (co-editor, with Helmut Krasser of the Austrian Academy 
of Sciences)
