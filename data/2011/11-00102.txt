FW: Vivaha Panchami (Nov 29)
Yes, rishi Vishwamitra.
But I find the combination of the picture and the text below much more
interesting, culture-wise.
While celebrating the divine Vivaha,
<<Let us take higher.

We shouldn't talk about "multiple Ramayanas", but we can, it seems,
freely link the Ramayana tradition to the local narco-business(es).
Regards,
Artur
