hotel in Mumbai
Hi Al,
I would recommend the Suba Palace which is right behind the Gate of India.
It is not the cheapest (around 5000 Rs) but at least it is decent,
something which is nowadays hard to get in Mumbai if you don't want to
spend lot's of money. I stayed there two years ago on a couple of
occasions.

All the best for your trip,
