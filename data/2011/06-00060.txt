For: `Public Domain'

Read: `Freely Available in the States'

Or so it seems:

 Hathi Trust :: Help - Copyright
 http://www.hathitrust.org/help_copyright#RestrictedAccess

It appears they are adopting an ultra-conservative approach.

Well enough given it all. My parents quit their house and the country
after the round in February, preferring to squat in my sister's place
in Barnes. One riverside to another, I'd have thought they'd have
learnt ;) They'll be back in a week or two but their place has
continued to break down so that is that. Still, despite everything,
almost everyone remains in good spirits. I'd like to think this is a
quality peculiar to New Zealanders, though I'm sure I'm wrong ...


Kind regards,

 Richard
