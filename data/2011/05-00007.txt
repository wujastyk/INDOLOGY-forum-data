Thanks to so many people on RISA and INDOLOGY who responded to my query about Astrology, both on- and off-list.  Some generously sent entire bibliographies.  I will definitely compile a list of all these references and send it out to both listservs -- *after* the academic year ends!   Regards to All.  --Tracy Coleman
