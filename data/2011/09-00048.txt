Indology FAQ
It struck me that the Indology FAQ lacked a section dealing with
technology-related queries of all natures, so I have added a category to
this effect and created some very rudimentary headings here:
http://faq.indology.info/wiki/Technology-Related_Matters.
If those in the group with some expertise in these matters could add
to/modify these headings and add content it would become a very welcome
resource for novices like me.
Thank you,
Venetia
