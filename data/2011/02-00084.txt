default reply behaviour (was: curses)
Palaniappan,
I sent the reply to Patrick directly, because I included a pdf file created from the GRETIL Unicode version of da?akum?racarita, and felt I needn't share it with all list members. Replying to the list requires little more additional effort than hitting Reply All rather than Reply. I then move the Indology address to the To field, and delete the previous sender's address.
If I recall correctly, the decision to set Reply to the individual was intended to reduce the number of private messages misdirected to the list.
Best wishes,
Elliot
