Palaniappan,

I sent the reply to Patrick directly, because I included a pdf file created from the GRETIL Unicode version of da?akum?racarita, and felt I needn't share it with all list members. Replying to the list requires little more additional effort than hitting Reply All rather than Reply. I then move the Indology address to the To field, and delete the previous sender's address.

If I recall correctly, the decision to set Reply to the individual was intended to reduce the number of private messages misdirected to the list.

Best wishes,

Elliot

But Patrick has received many responses as mentioned by him in his second post. While there may be cases where people might send information offline deliberately, I wonder if any Indologists simply hit 'Reply' and the responses went to Patrick alone and not to the list.
