Well, let me quit boring the participants of this list with my
konstant karping re A?oka Edicts.

But, one more question.

If "idha na kiMci jIvaM ArabhitpA prajUhitavyaM" reflects A?oka's will
that all earlier (Vedic) sacrifices involving killing animals be
stopped altogether, then - in what way would be his successors' power
legitimized? A?oka's claim to power is based on his participation in
the Vedic ritual of royal consecration (abhiSeka).

Artur Karp
