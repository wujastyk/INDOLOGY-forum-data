Organized opposition to evaluation of journals by the              European Reference Index for the Humanities
I've made enquiries, and the people at UCL who initiated this opposition
have now moved on (to the USA), and don't know how things unfolded.  Their
instinct was that this would happen whatever the response from the academic
community.  Nobody seemed to be listening at the ESF/ERIH.
