Dear members of the list,
I need to find a copy of Sanskrit text '?akun?r?ava' = '?akuna' of Vasantar?ja (11 century) for my master's theses.
The text was published 1940, Mumb?nagara, 1963, Bombay, reprinted 1987, Mumba? .
If anyone has access to an electronic version, please share the link. Or may be it can be ordered from a library.
Thank you
