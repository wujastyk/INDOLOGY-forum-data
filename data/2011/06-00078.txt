Subject: Poor quality of scans on Gallica
Message-ID: <161227092930.23782.14098211132904312398.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

dear Friends,

I doubt I am the only one to notice that at least some of the scans on
Gallica are atrocious; I just looked at Journal Asiatique for 1927, and
large parts of it are entirely illegible. Is this an issue that is being
addressed? I ask this in part since the Kern Institute, having lost our
library, has been attempting to find homes for our journals, and we have,
ironically perhaps, just gifted our run of JA to colleagues in Eastern
Europe. To be sure, the University Library owns a set, but in part our
thinking (or at least my thinking) was that electronic access was available.
It is, but only in the sense that the journal has been scanned, not that the
scan is readable....
