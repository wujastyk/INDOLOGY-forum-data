It is standard good practice in email forums to record when the subject of a
discussion moves on from one topic to another.  Someone posting a new
message may update the Subject: line to reflect this change.   A common way
to do it is to change

Subject: Old topic
to
Subject: New topic (was Old topic)

That's what has happened here.
