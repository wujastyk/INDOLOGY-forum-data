Yoga Body, a book by Mark Singleton
There is nothing wrong with either Mark Singleton's or Wendy Doniger's  
use of the word 'homonym', not that the question has any relevance to  
his book or her article (in the Times Literary Supplement this Sunday).
Take a look in the Oxford English Dictionary under the word 'homonym.'  
You'll find that the first/primary definition of 'homonym' given there  
is: "1a. The same name or word used to denote different things." This  
is obviously the sense of the word that Singleton and Doniger had in  
mind.
The second definition of 'homonym' in the Oxford English Dictionary is  
the limited technical sense of the word you have in mind:  "1b.  
Philol. Applied to words having the same sound, but differing in  
meaning." It is rather obvious that that isn't what they had in mind.
Clearly the word 'homonym' is itself a homonym (in the first sense).  
Maybe a linguist should know that? :^)
