Dear friends,
I would be grateful to receive pdf-s of the following,
if available:
Jacque May, La philosophie bouddhique idealiste,
Asiatische Studien 25 (1971): 265-323. [It is available 
on SEALS, but, so far as I can see, can only be
downloaded page by page.]
Lambert Schmithausen, The Ch'eng wei shih lun on the
existence of the external world. IIBS.
with thanks in advance,
Matthew
