116, 118, 120, 130, 148 152  all these images should NOT be in flash cut. Please leave little white space all around and captions must be in the bottom but never on the picture, only on the while space of paper. OK
Please feel free to ask for any query.
With kind regards and compliments for a Happy Diwali.
Yours sincerely,
Vijay Sharma
