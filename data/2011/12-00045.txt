Dear Prof Olivelle,

in case you are still looking for a place to stay in London, this may be of interest:

http://www.allenhall.org.uk/facilities/accommodation.html

I 'discovered' when I attended an event there: central, 
quiet, clean, and much less expensive than commercial 
accommodation, it may just fit the bill!

Best regards,

Elizabeth De Michelis

I will be in London for some work in August for about a week. I wonder whether any of you know of accommodation in central London other than hotels that charge you an arm and a leg!! Even accommodation in a university hostel condition. Thanks.

Patrick
