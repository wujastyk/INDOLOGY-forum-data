Asoka: Roads and Animals
Dear Stella and Dominik, 
Some?vara says that seven kinds of pulses can be used when making "s?pa", and they may be either milled/split or not ( (at M?nasoll?sa 3.1358-9 [vol. 2, p116]):
"s?pakarma?i saptaite niyojy?? s?pak?rakai? || 
dalit? 'dalit?? caite pacan?y? yath?ruci |"
He leaves the addition of meat as optional, suggesting that some people like to flavor it with pieces of mutton, kidneys, or bits of marrow (M?nasoll?sa 3.1371-2 [vol. 2, p117):
"kecid icchanti rucyartha? me?am??sasya kha??ak?n ||
v?kk?n v?pi dvidh? bhinn?n medasa? ?akal?ni v? | "
"s?pa" is of course also used much earlier in the Virata parvan of the MBH to describe what Bh?ma cooks as the s?pak?ra, but as far as I remember no specific details are given. 
Best,
