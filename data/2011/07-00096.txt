In Tamil and Malayalam some words with original ? are hypercorrected and pronounced with ?. 
Examples include the following
Ta. ??v?r>??v?r (See http://www.linguist.univ-paris-diderot.fr/~chevilla/FestSchrift/supa_9d.pdf)
Ta. k??vi > k??vi (See Comparative Dravidian Phonology by Kamil Zvelebil, 1970, p. 141)
Ma. *??cca > ??cca (DEDR 5157)
Given that Jaimin?ya S?ma Vedic pronunciation by Malayalam-speaking Nambudiri brahmins has i??, I wonder if the Sanskritists would consider that to be a case of hypercorrection for original i??. 
Thanks in advance.
