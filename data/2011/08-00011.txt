Dear members of the list!
my sincere apologies for a series of my blank emails, which I have just noticed! 
not sure, how it could happen and whether it might be a bug in the "versions" feature of the new OS X Lion.

what I thought to mention was a quotation from Su?rutasa?hit? that came to my mind by reading the word "dichotomy" and then Dr. Gangsten's mentioning of sth?vara-ja?gama. It also [most probably] places the human being (the object of medical applications and the main subject of medical science) - puru?a -  outside of this classification.

SS 1.1.22: ... loko hi dvividha? sth?varo ja?gama? ca dvividh?tmaka ev?gneya? saumya? ca ... tatra puru?a? pradh?na? tasyopakara?am anyat, tasm?t puru?o 'dhi??h?nam || 

and later on the origin of o?adhi-s
1.1.29 t?s?? sth?var?? caturvidh?? vanaspatayo v?k?? v?rudha o?adhaya iti | ....
1.1.30 ja?gam?? khalv api catuvidh?? jar?yuj???ajasvedajodbhijj?? | 

(just as a side-note: the distinction of sth?vara-ja?gama is more commonly found in medical treatises as a classification of poisons by the type of their carrier, see e.g. chapter 2 and 3 of SS Kalpasth?na)   

with my repeated apologies 

best
Andrey
