The Florence Fragments
Dear Allen,
when talking about the Sinhala script, the term mi?ra usually
refers to a grapheme set rather than a script style. The mi?ra set
includes a range of consonants for writing Sanskrit and Pali
loanwords (i.e., what we might otherwise think of as a complete
var?am?l?) and, secondarily, English etc. loanwords. In this
usage, mi?ra contrasts with ?uddha: the core set of Sinhalese
graphemes needed for the writing of E?u (tadbhava Sinhala) words.
Since Jacob?s manuscript is written in Sanskrit, it would have to
use the full (mi?ra) consonant inventory. I do not think (but may
be wrong) that the mi?ra inventory typically correlates with a
distinct script style.
All best,
