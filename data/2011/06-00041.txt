One should not accept a patient who is hated by physicians and kings alike,
or who has long hated them.  Nor should one accept a person who does not
have any medical necessities, who is distracted, unbiddable [avidheyam], or
whose life has run out.
"dvi?a? dvi?am" is, I believe, an intensive reduplication of the rare
indeclinable gerund form in -am.  Macdonell paragraph 166.    Opinions?
On avidheya, the commentator Aru?adatta says "avidheya? - bhi?aja?, tad?j???
yo na karoti, tam api tyajet" i..e., who doesn't do as he's told.  Hem?dri
says, "avidheya? - vaidyasy?nadh?nam" i.e., not obedient to the doctor.
