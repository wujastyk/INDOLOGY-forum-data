Hard to find item
Hello James,
It seems that he's missing an "i" in the title which might account for the difficulty. It should be "Buddhiyoga of the Gita..."
a search on worldcat reveals the following:
http://www.worldcat.org/title/buddhiyoga-of-the-gita-and-other-essays/oclc/670102526?referer=br&ht=edition
Looks like it's available in the BL.
good luck! 
cheers,
Adheesh
