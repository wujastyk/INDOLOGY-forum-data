The City in Sanskrit literature
The following seems to have escaped the notice of any correspondent
THE CITY IN EARLY HISTORICAL INDIA A.GHOSH IIAS, Simla 1973
One word of caution for those who are not acquainted with the views of the archaeologist:? he has
 completely changed his earlier stance regarding the origin of many elements of the city as expressed in 1955.

Hello Klaus,

do you (or anyone else) know if there are any studies of India's 
oldest fortifications/fortresses/fortified cities (up to ca. 1000 
A.D.)?

Best regards,
