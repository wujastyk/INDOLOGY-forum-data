Here's a copy of the message that I sent to Andrew Ollett. Please feel free to use similar arguments. OUP should be made aware of the fact that they are aiding and abetting an ideology that has already shown its disregard for human rights and ordinary human decency in the Gujarati pogrom of 2002.

All the best,

Hans Henrich Hock

Subject: Please add my name to those protesting OUP's craven action

Dear Colleague,

Please add my name to the list of those protesting OUP's craven reaction to right-wing Hindu attacks on Ramanujan's essay "Many Ramayanas". What OUP has done is aiding and abetting the worst extremist/fundamentalist elements in India. Imagine their withdrawing a translation of Heinrich Heine (a german Jewish author), just because the Nazis objected.

Sincerely,

Hans Henrich Hock
