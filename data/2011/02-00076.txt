RESEARCH ASSISTANT INTERNSHIPS
Mangalam Research Center for Buddhist Languages, Berkeley, CA
 
POSITION TITLE:  Research Assistant Intern (6 positions open)

DUTIES/JOB DESCRIPTION: Research assistants will participate in the creation of a database for translation and translation-related research. The internship is demanding, but also offers very unusual opportunities for learning about Buddhist languages, thought, and terminology that make this program an excellent choice for students considering an academic career or career as a translator. Interns will be closely supervised in their work by postdoctoral fellows and will take classes related to their training, including advanced language classes. They will be able to attend symposia held year-round featuring leading Buddhist scholars from around the world, and to take advantage of the cultural and educational resources of the University of California, located just two blocks away. Interns will also be eligible to take classes in Buddhist meditation, Tibetan yoga, and related teachings at a nearby Buddhist institute at no charge.
 
The kinds of work done by research assistants will vary depending on their skills, but could include the following:
-        review of texts in canonical languages or translations in Western languages to extract relevant terms and terminology

-        research on language, linguistics, history, and Buddhist thought in primary and secondary sources

-        data entry

-        work on database design

-        coding of texts according to the standards of the Text Encoding Initiative

HOURS:  Internships will start in October 2011. Research assistants work 6 days a week, 8:30 AM ? 5 PM; however, time is built into the schedule for classes and study.  A one-year commitment is required.
 
REQUIREMENTS:  
-        Applicants must have completed a BA before entering the program, preferably with a major or minor related to Buddhist studies.
-        A minimum of two years of formal instruction in Sanskrit, Pali, Classical Tibetan, or Classical Buddhist Chinese.

-        Computer-programming and database-related skills are desirable but not necessary.

-        Applicants should be familiar with basic Buddhist teachings.

-        Excellent attention to detail, flexibility, and a willingness to take instruction.

-        Willingness to work in a setting shaped by Buddhist principles (including vegetarian meals); however, applicants need not have a personal involvement in Buddhist teachings or practices.

COMPENSATION:  This is an unpaid internship position. Research assistants will receive room and board and a living expenses stipend of $150 monthly.
 
HOW TO APPLY:  Submit an email expressing interest to the email address given below. MRCBL will send you an application form together with a request for additional documentation. Completed applications must be received by April 4, 2011. You will be asked to submit one letter of recommendation from a faculty member in a position to assess your suitability for the program and your skills, so you may wish to make arrangements for such a letter in advance. Notifications of acceptance will be sent out by May 2, 2011.
