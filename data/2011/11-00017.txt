Incidentally, the greater weight on originality and creativity - and 
individuality - is also a feature of copyright in the European Union.
In Germany, for instance, critical editions are not protected by 
copyright (though introductions and annotation may be, depending on 
their character), but subject to a shorter period of protection of 25 
years.
Though this may sound offensive to those of us who put a lot of 
(creative and original, no doubt) work into editing, it is a great 
advantage for making Sanskrit texts available in digital format in the 
public domain, using more recent scholarly editions.
Best,
