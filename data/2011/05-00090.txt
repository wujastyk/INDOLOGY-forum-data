Fwd: Re: [INDOLOGY] Translations of Rig Veda Suparna Sukta (RV              I.164)
According to the author of the booklet joined to 
the audio-cd 'South India - Ritual Music and 
Theatre of Kerala' (Le Chant du Monde, collection 
CNRS/Mus?e de l'homme, Harmonia Mundi, LDX 274 
910, 1989) which gives as item 3 the recording of 
the beginning of RV 1.164 in ratha-paa.tha, there 
would exist an English  translation by F. Staal 
(maybe in his "Nambudiri Veda recitation"?).
