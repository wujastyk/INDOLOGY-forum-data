Dear Patrick?

 

Thanks! Does this word relate to our term ?soup?? I would agree with a suggestion that this covers a broad selection of dishes?sort of like what we find in recipe books today:  i.e., from a simple broth to stews or ragouts, wet or dry. It would be most informative if the p?ka??stra literature says more.

 

Cheers,

Joanna

The term is s?pa -- the expression s?p?tth?ya (Sk. s?p?rth?ya) -- for the sake of s?pa (probably more like stew, broth).

Dear List,

 

Since I?m dying of curiosity, if I may ask, can someone tell me what is the edict?s term for ?curry??

 

Anthropologists are also skeptical of such number codes and have published about them-- but sorry, no references come to mind.

 

Thanks

Joanna

 

 

 

" Obliquely, the Ist Rock Edict: "Formerly in the kitchen of king Devanampriya Priyadar?in many hundred thousands of animals (bah?ni

pr??asatasah?srani) were killed daily for the sake of curry"

[Hultzsch, 1925, p. 2]."

 

Sounds to me that one ought to apply the rule David Henige gives for premodern figures above ten thousand in his Numbers from Nowhere: The American Indian Contact Population Debate: just as a beginning, knock off the last digit.  Henige deals with evidence from a lot of other places besides the Americas, though as best I recall not South Asia.
