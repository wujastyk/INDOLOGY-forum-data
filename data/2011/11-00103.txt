Comparison Hindu and Sufi ritual
Dear Friend,
After much hesitation I bring to your notice the some very old publications. In fact my present studies are far removed from the subject mentioned by you. The books mentioned below were studied during student days just out of curiosity without any professional zeal. There is, moreover, every possibility of their being out dated. That is the reason for my hesitation. Please inform if you found them of any help.
