Offline Sanskrit Resources
Dear Dr. Hegarty,
There are a lot of offline resources.  You can start with the GRETIL e-library <http://www.sub.uni-goettingen.de/ebene_1/fiindolo/gr_elib.htm> for scanned books including Whitney's grammar and roots.  For dictionaries you could start with the HTML version of Monier-Williams available at Indica et Buddhica <http://repositorium.indica-et-buddhica.org/>.  That can be used in a web browser even when offline.  Many more resources are privately circulated.
Best,
Michael
