A student of mine, to whom I forwarded the AmalakI postings sent the  
following, which I find illuminating:
"It is the gooseberry and some varieties you can almost see through.  
It occurs many times in the Pali writings and in the commentary by  
Buddhaghosa does have this meaning.
One instance is his commentary on Digha Nikaya, Brahmajaalasutta (PTS  
I, 02)
The Pali reads (in Walshe's translation) "It is wonderful, friends,  
it is marvellous how the Blessed Lord, the Arahant, the fully  
enlighted Buddha knows, sees and clearly distinguishes the different  
inclination of beings!"
and the commentary comments as follows;
tena bhagavataa jaanataa ... pe ... suppa.tividitaa ti etthaaya.m  
sa"nkhepattho. yo so bhagavaa samati.msa paaramiyo puuretvaa  
sabbakilese bha~njitvaa anuttara.m sammaasambodhi.m abhisambuddho,  
tena bhagavataa tesa.m tesa.m sattaana.m aasayaanusaya.m  
jaanataa,hatthatale .thapita.m aamalaka.m viya sabba~neyyadhamma.m  
passataa . (1, 0043)
where Buddhaghosa says (roughly translated)
"known by the Blessed One .... up to (pe)  clearly distinguishes".   
Here is a condensed meaning (sa"nkhepattho). The Blessed One after  
fulfilling the thirty perfections, haveing destroyed all the  
afflictions, has achieved unsurpassed enightenment, by knowing the  
inclinations and predispositions of all beings, by seeing all the  
dharmas to be known like a gooseberry placed in the palm of one's  
hand...
There are lots of other references which the person interested could  
look up, but it will take some time,
Best,
Bryan
