Another bit of black anti-rakshas PR?
Dear Artur,
4-3-2-1 is not the same as 3-4-2-10. And you're ignoring the elephant 
head. With it, the numerical sequence would be 3-4-2-10-1.
If you want to see an intentionally distorted numerical sequence here (I 
don't), one could see 1+2+3+4 = 10.
As for taking /antaka/ to mean "the end of the world," there is no 
context for such a reading here. /Antaka/ looks here like the usual 
reference to death (the 'ender' of life), just as Pollock takes it in 
his translation. /K?la/, time, is commonly used in the epics as a 
synonym for death, as time eventually takes everyone's life away. If the 
'end of the world' were meant, one would expect the term /yug?nta/. See 
for instance, a few sargas down the line, at 3.23.26:
/yug?nt?gnir iva/
These comparisons to /yug?nta/ appear several times in V?lm?ki (and 
many, many times in the /Mah?bh?rata/), but even they don't necessarily 
imply a reference to the theory of the four yugas.
If one gets too 'creative' with these sorts of interpretations one can 
find almost anything in a text (including shish-kakob, to follow Joanna 
joke).
Regards,
Luis Gonz?lez-Reiman
