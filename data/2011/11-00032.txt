Tibetan textbook
Textbook: Stephen Hodge, An Introduction to Classical Tibetan
or, if you read German, 
Michael Hahn, Lehrbuch der klassischen tibetischen 
Schriftsprache
Both are particularly good for the translation literature.
Grammar: Marcelle Lalou, Manuel ?l?mentaire de tib?tain 
classique
or
Jacques Bacot, Grammaire du Tib?tain litt?raire
and, though it has its problems,
Stephen Beyer, The Classical Tibetan Language
Dictionary: start with Jaeschke, and avoid Das
until you are familiar with the former. 
Many online resources have become available, but they
are not geared toward the translation literature
and are often misleading in this area.
