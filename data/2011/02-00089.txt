Steven, I do take your point.  I think, upon reflection, that I can live 
with either system too.  I find it strange that a group of scholars would 
reproduce the error time and time again.  I say that without going back to 
the archives to determine if we had 'repeat offenders' or if each wrong 
post was a 'one-off' event.  My preference for 'reply to list' is that I 
benefit from following the series of responses to queries made to the 
list.

cheers,

Frank

As I said then, of the 8 or so professional lists I belong to (some moderated, some not; some with 'reply to list,' some not), I had never received anywhere near the number of accidental emails (or radically inappropriate emails for public consumption) as on this one.

While it is true that occasionally a member sends a private message and broadcasts it to the world, I suspect it is infrequent enough (and sometimes so "interesting"), that the alternative is not really satisfactory.
