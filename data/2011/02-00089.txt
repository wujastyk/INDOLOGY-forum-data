Fwd: Re: [INDOLOGY] default reply behaviour (was: curses)
Steven, I do take your point.  I think, upon reflection, that I can live 
with either system too.  I find it strange that a group of scholars would 
reproduce the error time and time again.  I say that without going back to 
the archives to determine if we had 'repeat offenders' or if each wrong 
post was a 'one-off' event.  My preference for 'reply to list' is that I 
benefit from following the series of responses to queries made to the 
list.
cheers,
Frank
