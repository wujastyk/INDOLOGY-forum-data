Can we review this?  It's a change that was made in the default behaviour of
the INDOLOGY list, by popular request last year.  It annoys me a lot, but,
unlike Muammar al-Gaddafi, I'm perfectly willing to abide by the will of the
majority.
The problem we were trying to solve was private replies to colleagues on the
list that inadvertently became public.  Perhaps that is a greater danger
than the annoyance of posts not going to the list at all.
How do others feel?  Reply to sender, or reply to list at large?
Best,
