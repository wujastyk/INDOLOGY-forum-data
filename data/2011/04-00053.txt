"Saa'nkhaayana Aara.nyaka
Dear Colleagues/Friends,
A student of mine is looking for the original Sanskrit text for the
ZaaGkhaayana AaraNyaka ("Saa'nkhaayana Aara.nyaka)
The English version was written by
Keith, A. B. K. 1908. "Saa'nkhaayana Aara.nyaka with an Appendix on  
the Mahaavrata. London: The Royal Asiatic Society.
If anyone knows how to access the original Sanskrit, I would  
appreciate the information.
Thanks and best wishes to all
Stella Sandahl
