Yoga Body, a book by Mark Singleton---Add "dharma"
Dear List,
We are all familiar with the dvanda compound naama-ruupa.  I think that both
of these terms refer to things that are substantive.  If you are a
thoughtful person, you know that the use of words is important -- not a
quibble at all.
I happen to think that Singleton's use of words is sloppy, if not
deceptive.  Those of you who care more about asanas than words can ignore
everything that I have said in this discussion.
I myself am done with it, and disgusted with it.
