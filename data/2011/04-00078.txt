Identification of rivers
Dear Jim,
?atarudr? (occurs also in the Matsyapur??a, see pw) is mentioned by 
Al-B?r?n? in his enumeration of rivers having their source in the Himavat 
(Sachau, Vol. 1: ch. 25).
Sircar identifies it with the ?atadru river (Geography of Ancient and 
Medieval India 1971: 51, n. 3).
?atadru/?dr? itself seems to be the result of post-vedic folk etymology 
(ved. ?utudr?, etc.), and the situation could have been similar with the 
formation of ?atarudr? (and possibly also with ?r?r?tri) as deliberate 
attempts of giving these rivers an easily comprehensible meaning. 
"Corruption" in the strict sense is perhaps not applicable to such names.
Best, Walter

Ego ex animi mei sententia spondeo ac polliceor
studia humanitatis impigro labore culturum et provecturum
non sordidi lucri causa nec ad vanam captandam gloriam,
sed quo magis veritas propagetur et lux eius, qua salus
humani generis continetur, clarius effulgeat.
