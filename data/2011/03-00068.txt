Organized opposition to evaluation of journals by the European              Reference Index for the Humanities
A couple of years ago Dominik Wujastyk alerted this list to the Journals Under Threat initiative which sought to oppose the evaluation of journals by the European Reference Index for the Humanities. Opposition was led by journals in History of Science, Technology and Medicine, but found support from other bodies, including the Royal Asiatic Society. 
Does anyone have any recent updates on this initiative? There is no sign of recognition from the ERIH website (http://tinyurl.com/6fmmyaw) that their plans have received anything other than ecstatic approval.
