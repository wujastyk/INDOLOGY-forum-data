Dear McComas,
I read your article on ?Mythology Wars? and found it for the most part well written and informative. 
I would, however, suggest considering to change the passage ?we cannot deny that Oriental Studies was the handmaiden of colonialism and imperialism? into a less general statement. As it stands, it is (at least) a gross oversimplification of the complex motives and methods of early oriental studies. I don?t know if you read Halbfass? ?India and Europe?. If not, I strongly recommend it to you. I am sure you will enjoy the reading...
All the best,
Philipp
