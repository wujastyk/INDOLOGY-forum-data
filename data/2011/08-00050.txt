Dear Dipak,
In what way is it certain? What is meant by "from state"? What do you mean
by "animals"?
Yes, Artha?astra and A?oka's Edicts, as evidence. But - do we have tools
with which to find out exactly what in these texts belongs to the sphere of
postulates and what represents the sphere of practices?
Any iconographic evidence?
Best,
Artur Karp
