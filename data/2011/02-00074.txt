Edited volume on 'peritexts'?
Dear Colleagues
I am hoping that one of you erudite folk might be able to remind me of the title of a recently published edited volume on Sanskritic 'peritexts', which includes a chapter with a title like, 'Why we should read pra?astas'.
Please reply off-list to mccomas.taylor at anu.edu.au
Thanks in advance
McComas
