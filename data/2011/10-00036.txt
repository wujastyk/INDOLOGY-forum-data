Sad news about Greg Possehl, with his bibliography
11:56: 13 AM CDT Sad news: Greg Possehl. Dear all, You may  
have already heard this news, but I just learned that Greg passed away  
last night -- from a heart attack and/or stroke. A sad loss for our  
South Asian community, for Greg?s many friends, and for all of us he  
has mentored and supported over the years. Regards, Carla
I HAVE RECEIVED THIS SAD NEWS WHILE IN OMAN, WORKING TO ASSIST THE  
MINISTRY OF HERITAGE AND CULTURE TO DEVELOP AND EXPAND THE ARCHAEOLOGY  
IN THE SULTANATE.I HAD BROUGHT GREG HERE IN 2004 IN RELATION TO THE  
MAGAN BOAT PROJECT, AND WE DECIDED HE SHOULD ESTABLISH A PROJECT ON  
THIS SIDE OF THE ARABIAN SEA AS WELL: A NEW ADVENTURE TO SHARE, ALONG  
WITH SERGE CLEUZIOU. GIVEN HIS HIGHEST CREDENTIALS THE MINISTRY  
OFFERED HIM TO EXPLORE BAT, THE MOST IMPORTANT SITE IN THE HEARTLAND  
OF OMAN,  LISTED IN THE UNESCO WORLD HERITAGE....... WHAT TO DO NOW. I  
HOPE CHRIS, CHARLOTTE AND OTHERS WILL CONTINUE, WHILE I KEEP ON  
TRACKING ON A LONESOME PATH..... SOMETIME I WISH I BELIEVE IN  
SOMETHING BEYOND DEATH, BUT I CAN TRUST ONLY THE MEMORY OF OTHER HUMAN  
BEINGS. GREG WILL LIVE THERE, WITH MANY OTHER GOOD MEN AND WOMEN.

After the above sad news reached me this morning, I have been working  
on the following provisional bibliography of my respected colleague  
and friend, offered here in appreciation of his lifework devoted to  
the study of the Indus Civilization. I am sending this to the INDOLOGY  
and RISA -lists and to colleagues who may not be receiving these lists.
