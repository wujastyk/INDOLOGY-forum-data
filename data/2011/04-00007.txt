AVP 16.102.1 might have been the 'master' mantra and the later versions modelled on it.

Dear Colleagues,
? ? The very popularly recited mantra "p?r?am ada? p?r?am idam.." occurs as the beginning ??ntimantra for the ???v?sya-Upani?ad. ?It came to me as a surprise that Bloomfield's Vedic concordance does not list this among the mantras, nor does Jacob's Concordance of the Upanishads list it. ?I was equally surprised that most published editions of the ???v?sya-Upani?ad do not begin with this mantra, but, as expected, they begin with the mantra: ??? v?syam idam ... ? Among the editions I have consulted, only the ?nand??rama (Pune) edition of the ???v?sya-Upani?ad with ???karabh??ya offers this mantra before the text of the Upani?ad proper, but ?a?kara does not comment on it, nor does any other commentary that I have seen comment on it. ?I am wondering if anyone has seen any research relating to the antiquity of this mantra. ?I would be most happy to receive any information on this subject. ?Best,
Madhav
