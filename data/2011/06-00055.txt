New publications
 Dear Colleagues,
Please excuse me for mentioning a new publication to which I have
contributed. A two-panel gathering was held in October 2010 at the 39th
Annual South Asia Conference in Madison, WI that was conceived to coincide
with the roughly half a century since the completion of the Pune Critical
Edition of the *Mahabharata*. Seven of the papers from that conference have
been updated and comprise, along with an Introduction, the latest issue of
the *Journal of Vaishnava Studies* 19,2 (2011) under the overall heading
"Mahabharata Conference." The contents are:
Vishwa P. Adluri, Introduction: The Critical Edition and Its Critics, A
Retrospective on Mahabharata Scholarship
T. P. Mahadevan, The Three Rails of the Mahabharata Text Tradition
Christopher Austin, Evaluating the Critical Edition of the Mahabharata:
Inferential Mileage and the Apparatus Materials

Uses of the Pune Critical Edition (CE)

Force of Some Extraordinary Figures of Speech
