Dear Indologists,

I was being asked by the Jammu & Kashmir Chapter of the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) if I know of some expert on the ancient and medieval architecture of Kashmir. I don't think I know many scholars except Professor Pratapaditya Pal and Professor Walter Slaje. Any suggestions would be highly appreciated. Thanks in advance.

Best wishes.
