Authorship of the Muk undam=?utf-8?Q?=C4=81l=C4=81?=
Discussing the Vai??ava saint Kula?ekhara ??v?r and the author of Mukundam?l? In his book Viraha-Bhakti (p. 256, n. 56), Friedhelm Hardy  says, "A king Kula?ekhara signs the Mukundam?l? (in the ?rutiphala), a Sanskrit stotra. Most authors have simply identified the two kings. Since I plan to deal extensively with the textual and authorship problem of the work elsewhere, I shall not enter here into the very complex situation. But I am convinced on the evidence I have collected that the author of the stotra is different from the ??v?r."
Does anybody know if and where Hardy published his findings on the authorship of the Mukundam?l?? I would really appreciate if I can get a copy of the article.
Thanks in advance.
