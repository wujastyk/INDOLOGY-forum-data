curses
Don't know if your student would be interested in this aspect at all  
different religious affiliations had impacted the nature of the curses.
For example, in the Tamil epic Cilappatikaram, a Jain nun curses two  
people to become "old jackals," whereas in Tamil inscriptions the  
curses normally center around sending the affected parties to "hell."
