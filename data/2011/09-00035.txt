Comparison of Buddhist and Hindu literary sources
As for the French Indian & Buddhist Studies, a relevant discussion,
continuing Madeleine Biardeau's work on the the Epics (especially of 1999 &
2002), you may find in Jean-Pierre Osier's long introduction to his
translation of the Vessantarajataka (Paris: Cerf, 2010).
In a 2009 study of earthquakes in Indian Buddhist sources and a
forthcoming second part which would benefit from the recent issue of RoSA on
this topic, I compare several stock expressions relating earthquakes to
heroes (birth, death, exceptional agency, etc.), which perhaps underline
polemics of cosmic status in Buddhist and Hindu sources. In his *A Bull of a
Man *(Harvard 2009), John Powers discussed bold expressions like rsabha,
jinarsabha u. Verw.: however, all these seem to be much more frequent in the
Epics than in Buddhist early sources. A forthcoming French book by Ronan
Moreau will also show the functioning of animal comparison in the Epics,
which have many echoes in Pali/BH Sanskrit/Gandhari sources.
