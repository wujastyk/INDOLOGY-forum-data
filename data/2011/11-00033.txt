Tibetan textbook

   Unfortunately, there aren't any real textbooks for classical Tibetan literature.  There have been attempts over the years to publish various "readers," but the authors usually lacked a sufficient command of Tibetan grammar to make them very useful. At present there are only two textbook projects underway that I am aware of: my own work geared specifically towards classical Tibetan religious & philosophical literature (_A Classical Tibetan Reader_, to be published by Snow Lion), and another by Matthew Kapstein which I believe is more generic in scope (I have not actually seen it, so cannot say).  Neither one is published.
  Regarding grammar presentations, the two best ones are Michael Hahn's _Textbook of Classical Literary Tibetan_, portions of which seem to be available online at Harvard:
