tracing a verse >              vedap=?UTF-8?Q?=C4=81=E1=B9=ADha_-_vik=E1=B9=9Btis.?=
Dear list
In my fieldwork on the Vedic schools of Maharashtra, the following verse was
given to me by a vaidika describing the recitational permutations of the
Veda.
*ja?? m?l? **?ikh? **rekh**? **dhvajo **da??o** ratho ghana**?**
itya??o vik?ti prokta? kramap?rva mahar?ibhi?*
When asked about the textual source, the vaidika wasn't able to produce a
textual reference. He only said it was a quite popular verse. I haven't been
able to trace it back yet. Does anybody know in which text this verse might
be found?
Thank you all for your responses and happy Easter!
Best,
