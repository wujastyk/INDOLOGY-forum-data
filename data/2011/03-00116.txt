Dear McComas,

This is an interesting paper.  Thank you.  Yes, this is obviously an issue
that we all, as Indologists, need to confront.  But, since I am not much
interested in these mythology wars between Wendy's children and Rajiv's
children, and since I am no one's child, maybe I can present a different
point of view here, an orphan's view, as it were.

I am a Vedicist.  When I teach Vedic, I don't teach it as an outsider, i.e.,
as about them.  I teach it as an insider, i.e., about us.   As a Vedicist, I
do not think of myself as studying somebody else's culture.  I think of
myself as studying our collective culture, just as when I study Greek or
Chinese culture, or Mayan or Sumerian culture, etc., I always think of
myself as studying our collective culture.

In other words, I think that we are all both insiders and outsiders.  I am a
human being.  All things human are a part of my culture.

And when, in particular, it comes to a Vedic culture that existed some 3000
years ago, but which in fact survives no longer, nobody has better access to
it than those of us who have spent our lives studying it.

Isn't this obvious?  When it comes to the Rigveda, is Rajiv really an
insider?

Best,

George Thompson
