Dear Ryan,

This ny?ya is quite common and it is used also with other fruits. In  
the Mok?op?ya (an older and more genuine Version of the Yogav?si??ha)  
both the ?malaka and the bilva fruit are frequently mentioned in this  
ny?ya -- just one example for both:

yath? karatale bilva? yath? v? parvata? pura? /
pratyak?am evam asy?lam ajatva? param?tmana? // (III.66.24)

(forthcoming: J. Hanneder, P. Stephan, S. Jager [ed.], Mok?op?ya. Das  
dritte Buch. Utpattiprakara?a. Kritische Edition. [Anonymus  
Casmiriensis: Mok?op?ya. Historisch-kritische Gesamtausgabe unter der  
Leitung von Walter Slaje. Textedition. Band 2]. Wiesbaden 2011)

kar?malakavadd???asa?s?r?s?ras?ra he /
j??n?m?tamah?mbhodhe mune sv?gatam astu te // (VI.226.18)

(B. Lo Turco [ed.], Mok?op?ya-??ka of Bh?skaraka??ha. The fragments of  
the Nirv??aprakara?a. Critical edition. Halle 2011)

Cf. also Aptes Collection of Popular Sanskrit Maxims (karavinyastabilvany?ya).

Possibly this ny?ya is based on the rather big size of the fruits,  
perhaps also on their eye-catching colour. In this connection the  
following stanza from O. Boehtlingk's ?Indische Sprueche? (No. 2045)  
could be interesting:

khala? sar?apam?tr??i paracchidr??i pa?yati /
?tmano bilvam?tr??i pa?yann api na pa?yati //

In the first stanza of Subandhus V?savadatta even the badara fruit is used
in the same ny?ya:

karabadarasad??am akhila? bhuvanatala? yatpras?data? kavaya? /
pa?yanti s?k?mamataya? s? jayati sarasvat? dev? //


Best wishes,
Martin

> Dear all,

> I recently came across a reference to the ?malaki fruit in the  
> Buddhist /Mah?m?y?tantra/ and in its commentary, the /Gu?avat?/ by  
> Ratn?kara??nti.  The citations are as follows:
>
> First from the root tantra, in Tibetan (there is no extant Sanskrit

>
> Which Ratn?kara??nti glosses with: /svahaste sthitamekam?malakam

>
> I initially took this to mean simply that the referent was as clear
