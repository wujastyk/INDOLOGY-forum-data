Devanagari verse and LATEX
Dear Adriano and list members,
I second Dominik's recommendations about XeTeX.  There is also an email list specifically for Ledmac and Ledpar: <https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/ledmac-users>.  I will send Adriano and any other interested party an example file using Ledpar for a parallel edition of verses.  Please write to me off-list.  
Best,
