New International Master Program in Buddhist Studies at Hamburg              University
  Dear Colleagues,
  recently a new two-year Master Program in Buddhist Studies has been  
approved at Hamburg University (Asien-Afrika-Institut). Requirements  
for admission comprise, among others, reading skills in at least one  
of the following languages: Sanskrit, Tibetan, Chinese, or Japanese.  
The new Master Program is added to a range of already running Master  
Programs focusing on classical India, Tibet (focusing on Buddhism),  
China and Japan.
  Teaching language of the new Master in Buddhist Studies will be  
English (for the focus China and Japan German will also be needed).
  Unfortunately time is short and applications for admission are due  
already on July 15, 2011.  We encourage any students who might be  
interested to apply.  For more on our English-taught Master Programs
