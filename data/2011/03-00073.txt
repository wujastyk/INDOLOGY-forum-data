The Australian National University has dated a piece of silk cloth, dug
up from
excavations at the Delivala Stupa in Rambukkana (Sri Lanka), to be 2,200
years
old, Director General of the Department of Archaeology Dr. Senarath
Dissnayake
told The Island yesterday.
"This piece of silk, found during an excavation in 2001, belonged to the
second
century BC and it is the oldest piece of textile found in Sri Lanka,
according
to the conclusions of the Carbon 14 dating process led by Prof Judith
Cameron of
the Australian National University," he said.
Dr. Dissanayake said that this artifact once again confirms the
historical and
archaeological evidences that Sri Lanka was a hub in the ancient
maritime silk
route. This also validates the historical accounts of trade and other
links Sri
Lanka had with China. Not only silk and spices but also Buddhism had
traversed
the ancient silk route.
"This had been used to wrap a metal relic casket which is a miniature
replica of
a stupa. The silk had been faded, therefore it is difficult to ascertain
its
original colour until further laboratory investigations," he said.
The silk had been adorned with beads embedded into it, Dr. Dissanayake said
adding that the artifact was now kept at the Delivala Stupa site with
security
and if the need arose it would be shifted to the National Museum.
