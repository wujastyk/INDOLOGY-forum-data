New version of the DCS
Dear list,
a new version of the Digital Corpus of Sanskrit is available at http://kjc-
fs-cluster.kjc.uni-heidelberg.de/dcs/index.php.
While the database remains unchanged in this version, the user interface 
now contains a more sophisticated function for searching for collocations. 
You start by selecting one lexeme (e.g., rAma), and the corpus proposes all 
other lexemes that are found in the same sentences as rAma (e.g., 
aklishta). By adding new lexemes to the search path (rAma + aklishta), it 
is possible to track topics and phrases effectively.
A more detailed overview of how to use this function can be found at http://
kjc-fs-cluster.kjc.uni-heidelberg.de/dcs/index.php?
contents=help_collocations.
Best, 
Oliver Hellwig
