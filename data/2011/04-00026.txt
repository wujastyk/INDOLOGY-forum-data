Persian and Arabic borrowings in Sanskrit
No one seems to have mentioned the Sanskrit trans.
of Prince Dara Shukoh's Majma ul-Bahrain,
i.e., the Samudrasamaagamana.
It has been published a couple of times,
though, I am now traveling and do not have
the precise references at hand. It should be
not difficult to find.
