It is to be noted that the text with translation of the 
caturangaa.s.taka (of which only 6 verses are preserved) of Melputtur 
Narayana Bhatta, on the rules of the (two players) caturanga, as 
traditionally practised by  Kerala Nambudiri brahmins in Kerala, is 
furnished  by C. Rajendran at the end of his recent  booklet on M N B 
in the series "Makers of Indian Literature" (Sahitya Akademi, 2008; 
cf. his previous article "A note on the Catura;ngaa.s.taka of 
Melputtuur Naaraaya.na Bha.t.tathiri", Adyar Library Bulletin 64, 
2000, pp. 81-87).
