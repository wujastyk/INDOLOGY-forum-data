I think they are different. The naaraaya.nabali as far as I know is connected with funeral rites and mostly performed by vai.s.nava-s other than Brahmins.

        Just a curiosity. Is this vi.s.nubali the same as the wellknown nArAya.navali?

          Regarding Vai.s.nava "suudra-s in the Vaikhanasa system one may not find anything. For, the vaishnavism propounded in the Vaikhanasa Agama-s is exclusively meant for Brahmains. Most probably the reason being, the Vaikhaanasa Agama is claimed to be based on the Aukheya "saakhaa (now extinct ?) of the Yajurveda. Of course there exists a Vaikhanasa mantrapra"sna just as there is the aapastambamantrapra"sna which is fully used by them for all their domestic rites.
          Further, a vaikhanasa is born by the sacrament called vi.s.nubali performed during pregnancy and not 'made' by diik.saa as in the case of Paa~ncaraatra system. These are the fundamental differences between these two branches of Vaishnava religion. Therefore there cannot be theoretically any vai.s.navaanta"suudra or vai.s.nva"suudra in the vaikhaanasa.

          The work I meant is a Vaikh?nasa text of encyclopaedic
          nature dealing, inter alia, on settlements and temple construction, published
          as K??yapaj??nak???a?(K??yapasa?hit?), ed P?rthas?rathiBha???c?rya
          Tirupati1948. I rummaged through at random and unsuccessfully for caste
          references.

          Thank you Dipak. Although I do not think there is any connection between the Kasyapottarasa?hita in hand and the medical text called Kasyapasa?hita (if that?s what you refer to), I have checked the latter, and found nothing. Elsewhere in the Kasyapottara itself, so far as I have read, no similar list appear, and a word search of the corpus of Unicode Skt texts on my computer shows no occurrences of, e.g., of strings beginning saivantar, vai??avantar, sudrantar, and the like. So it remains rather anomalous.
          As I said, I can simply guess
          that Vai??avantarasudra would mean something like Vai??avasudra manqu?, with -antara = ?other? in the sense of ?lesser?, but I still wonder if there is any precedent or parallels for such an expression.

          The word -antara meaning 'others' in a compound usually refers to variants, extras etc. One has to check if a supplementary list is concerned where it will be appropriate to term the new entries as such. Will you check if any list of ;Suudras of the Vai.s.nava-, ;Saiva- etc. varieties has already been
          mentioned? I shall check the Kaa;syapa-Sa.mhitaa itself. Perhaps, you too can yourself do that. But i will.

          Dear all,
          Reading the (unpublished) Kaa"syapottarasa.mhitaa (adhyaaya 18), I have been puzzling over the precise implications of some categories of "Suudra described therein, categories including the suffix -antara, as follows (in descending rank order):
          Vai.s.nava vs. Vai.s.navaantara,
          "Saiva vs.
          "Saivaantara,
          Saamaanya vs. Saamaanyaantara,
          Sa.mkara vs. Sa.mkaraantara.
          An initial round of searches has not yielded any parallels that would suggest what distinguishes, e.g.., a 'Vai.s.navaantara"suudra' from a 'Vai.s.nava"suudra'. The text itself is not really explicit, except to suggest that the Vai.s.navaantara is a lower status. In this case, the lower status may be implicitly attributable to association with "Saivas (despite having received the sa.mskaaras taught in the Puraa.nas and Paa~ncaraatra "saastras, noted in the preceding stanza): "saivaagamoktasa.mskaarisambandha.m samavaapya ca | svaya.m ced vai.s.navas ti.s.thed vai.s.navaantara iirita.h ||
          Have others encountered similar status-titles in other works? Does 'X-antara' simply imply 'a lesser' or 'not quite an' X?
