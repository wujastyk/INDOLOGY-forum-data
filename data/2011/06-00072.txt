Dear Prof. Jha,
Please try eJIM, the eJournal of Indian medicine, which is a
multidisciplinary periodical that publishes studies on traditional South
Asian medical systems by qualified scholars in philology, medicine,
pharmacology, botany, anthropology and sociology. Website address is
www.indianmedicine.nl.

We have published several articles on poison, snake-bites, etc. Just one
recent example: Traditional Poison-healing System in Kerala: an Overview, by
Tsutomu Yamashita, Brahmadathan U.M.T., Madhu K. Parameswaran.

Dear List,
One of my former students is seeking bibliographic information on 
poisons and their treatment in ancient India. Since I am familiar with
literature on the subject I am giving below her request for help:
 "I am looking for material for a paper on poisons, anti-venom drugs and
treatment in ancient India. I haven't come across too many secondary
writings on this."
