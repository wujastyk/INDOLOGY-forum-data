Hard to find item
Dear Colleagues,
A student of mine that is looking at the concept of buddhi in a  
variety of contexts is having difficulty in obtaining the following  
publication. Even inter-library loan has let him down. The reference  
is (though it looks a little odd, I give it as he sent it to me):
Anirvan, Buddhyoga of the Gita and other Essays. New Delhi: Biblio  
Impex Privat 1981.
Can anyone help?
With Thanks and Best Wishes,
