Sanskrit teachign post in British secondary school
The history of the SES is reasonably well documented on their own websites,
though perhaps with different emphases than we would put on matters.  Very
much condensed, the Scottish politician Andrew
Maclaren<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_MacLaren>started the
groups that became the SES.  His son, the barrister Leon
Maclaren, inherited his father's passionate devotion to the causes of social
justice, and took over the SES discussion groups, extending the courses from
just economics to wider philosophical issues. The Wikipedia page (on 15 Oct
2011) on Leon Maclaren <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_MacLaren>, says
most of what there is to be said from there on, I think.
In answer to your question, George, no, Leon Maclaren wasn't interested in
vedanta as a source of economic ideas.  His personal trajectory, or quest,
evolved from economics and social issues to soteriological matters, and he
was interested in vedanta in its own terms, as a source of spiritual ideas
that he taught in London, where the SES continued (and perhaps continues?)
to teach economics alongside the more soteriological materials that they
call "practical philosophy."  They advertise quite widely in the tube and
elsewhere in London (like

which is from Dublin).
The SES took up Krishna Tirthaji Maharaj's book, Vedic Mathematics, in a big
way, many years ago, taking it completely at face value as a vedic
revelation.  Largely as a result of the SES's championing this material in
their schools, a mini industry has grown of books for kids teaching these
methods of mental arithmetic, and this has been very well received and
extended in India (though there is also a literature of opposition and
debunking).  Motilal Banarsidas' shop in Delhi has a couple of shelves of
"vedic maths" books.
Best,
