spoken Sanskrit class this summer
My son is contemplating this class in Heidelberg. He has the Sanskrit
background for it but is hesitant because it is conducted (like all language
immersion programs) in the language being taught. I would be interested to
hear from anyone who has taken this course in the past, hopefully telling
Nick that it is not too threatening.
