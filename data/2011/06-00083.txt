Dear All:
On this topic but in more broad terms, Sheldon Pollock has recently 
written a very important article on the larger ethical implications of 
the loss of classical languages and the discipline of philology in 
Universities worldwide. Given the constituency of this list, we should 
all read it as he makes some important suggestions about how "we" should 
position ourselves in terms on theoretical sophistication and in 
relation to institutional mission statements and identity.

Hard World." /Critical Inquiry/, 35 (2009): 931-961.
