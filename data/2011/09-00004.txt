A coffee break conference
Dominik,
The quote ("The present project?.one's own one.") was from Elisa Freschi's kind invitation in the first message on this thread,  "to the second  "coffee break conference" on Classical and Contemporary South Asian to be held in Rome, Sapienza University, next week (8th to 10th September)." The rest, ("Sounds like?hereby notified") was my little bagatelle of a comment.

Sounds like an excellent idea.  Ananda Coomaraswamy when attending lectures would compose himself very comfortably and shut his eyes, to go to sleep if the talk weren't interesting.  He felt it was the speaker's duty to keep the audience interested and awake.
But I must say it sounds a little inconsiderate, unless one were part of a big audience and not noticeable.  I have sleep problems and sometimes if I know the speaker go up to explain and apologize in advance.  (Present company is hereby notified.)
