Dear SIrs,
I have been a member in the past though my contributions were minor at
best. Presently, I have a straight forward request for a citation

"Iam trying to locate a footnote reference that cites three of Sankara's
disciples independently holding saksi in the place of "Ultimate
Experience". I'm misquoting but not grossly. Might anyone know and share
where this came from..
