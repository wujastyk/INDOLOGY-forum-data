[INDOLOGY] New book on ?g Veda
I would like to draw the attention of colleagues to the publication by Joanna Jurewicz,?Fire and Cognition in the ?gveda, ELIPSA, Warsaw 2010. ?ISBN 978-83-7151-893-5 (pbk), 485pp.
Her use of cognitive linguistics as a key to unlock the meanings of many Vedic passages hitherto considered obscure is to my mind completely convincing. ?Rarely does it happen that
anyone follows a new approach to interpreting an acknowledged masterpiece of
world literature, and more rarely still are the results so illuminating that they
may rank as a true discovery.
The book is not available on Amazon, but it is cheap?http://www.prus24.pl?(this page is in English), put in keywords ?fire & Veda.? Click to put in your basket. ?Then proceed to checkout.?
