 Dear Dominik, When you suggest taking dvi?a? dvi?am as an iterated gerund
with -am, I suppose you mean the type accounted for by P??ini's *?bh?k??ye
?amul ca* (3.4.22).  However, this would then be *dve?a? dve?am*, like *bhoja?
bhojam*.  I suggest that the phrase in your text has iteration as accounted
for by *nityav?psayo?* and means 'every single one who hates them'.
 Regards, George
