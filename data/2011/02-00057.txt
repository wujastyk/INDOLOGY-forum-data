Hi Greg,
As my later posting shows, there were only 8 professors, besides the 
principal, at Banaras Sanskrit College, founded by Resident Jonathan 
Duncan in 1791.  Of these only Gosain Anand Ghan/Gyan/Gin/Gir was named 
for the pur??as.  Banaras Sanskrit College was the only institution run 
by the British for panditic education at that time.  So that makes him 
one of a kind.
Cheers,
Rosane (with only one n):-)
