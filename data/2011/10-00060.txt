Porunthal: dating of paddy in the 5th century B.C. and              possible consequences on the evaluation of the history of writing              in India
More than that ... Dear JLC,
The statement, "Archaeologists, particularly in Tamilnadu, seem to be  
under a constant kind of pressure (or is it a mindset?) to "push  
back" so far established dates. They regularly come up with various  
attempts." needs some attention and substantiation. I wish genuine  
and serious scholars would stop making such flippant remarks! :-)
Best wishes,
V.S. Rajam
