Indologists--

I have a student interested in studying Buddhist male monasticism in the present day, preferably Tibetan Buddhism.  She is especially interested in examining monasticism as male culture, so sources that explicitly treat gender would be most welcome.  Ideally, she wants to look at contemporary monks, but studies of this sort that focus on monasticism in earlier historical periods would also be very helpful.

Thanks for any suggestions.
