Devanagari verse and LATEX
Dear list members,
I?ve been trying to use the devanagari package together with ledmac and
ledpar to produce facing page output and it works fine for prose texts
(though I have some doubts on how many text chunks should be handled at each
Pages environment) , but when a I try to write verse ---either with the
\stanza or {astanza} environments---, it doesn?t work. Could anyone give me
a hand on that?
Best wishes
