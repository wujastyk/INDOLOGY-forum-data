What's the difference between Arabic and Sanskrit
Jennifer's friend is clearly deeply grounded in the intellectual tradition of the West. As is well known, Egypt is the mother of all idolatry, and the connection between Egypt and "sanskrit" (Jennifer's friend here clearly refers, synecdochically, to what other scholars have recently labelled "the Sanskrit cosmopolis") is firmly established in the work of many learned writers such as Fran?ois Catrou, Pierre Daniel Huet and Mathurin Veyssi?re de la Croze. The connection is also acknowledged by Indian scholars: M.N. Srinivas describes the "Egypt fixation" which his teacher G. S. Ghurye had inherited from W. H. R. Rivers, and which led him to wonder if ancestor shrines among the Coorgs were derived from the pyramids. 
Jennifer's wrong about Arabic being prettier, however.
