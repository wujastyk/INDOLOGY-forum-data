Dear Tim,
This isn't quite what you?re looking for, but perhaps it might help.
Post-twelfth-century South Indian Siddh?ntatantras often include Av?ntara-?aivas, typically as the fifth class of ?aivas (out of 5, 7 or 9 classes), below An?di-?aivas, ?di-?aivas, Mah?-?aivas and Anu-?aivas (e.g. P?rva-k?mika 21.36; P?rva-k?ra?a 30:37?8; Ajitatantra 63.16?17; Maku??gama 1.16?17 and 3.72?3).  Subdivisions of the Av?ntara-?aivas are to be found towards the beginning of the J?tinir?ayap?rvak?layaprave?avidhi (verses 11ff), edited by Pierre-Sylvain Filliozat in Journal Asiatique 263 (1975):103?117.
