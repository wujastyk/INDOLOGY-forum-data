Dear Colleague,
I have no problems with hard facts. One of them is that the king did state.
And that he ordered his statements to be engraved on suitable rock surfaces
and on pillars. But the relation of the contents of his statements to
reality is open to enquiry. Thank you for allowing me to use my freedom and
go on doubting. I shall use it, certainly.
Yours, etc.,
