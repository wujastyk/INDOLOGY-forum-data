Dear colleagues

I am interested in the contemporary uses of puranic texts, in particulary the Skandapur??a. Below is a list of the main m?h?tmya of the Skanda.

Do any of you good folk know if any of these texts are still recited or at least drawn on or employed in ritual in their relevant situations?

Thanks in advance

McComas
