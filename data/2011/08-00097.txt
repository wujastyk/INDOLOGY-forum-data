Re: [INDOLOGY] Fwd: [INDOLOGY] taxonomy question
Intensive study of the inscriptions is the main instrument. That can be misused: V.Smith, for example, saw nothing beyond feeling of unity with animals, a view indirectly reiterated by Keith,? as if Asoka did not feel for man. D. D. Kosambi (junior) will help those who want to find the 'break'. The abolition of apavaahana is something mentioned by the emperor himself that was bound to result in loss of revenue and the enterpreneurship of the state. I need not state them here. After Kosambi and Romila Thapar it is not necessary to speculate on the break, nor difficult to do away with the previous garbage.
The present correspondent's study is in Bengali , hence will not help

Asoka was a reformer breaking with the past.
As a reformer AND a politician - how far would A?oka go with his project of ?breaking with the past?
To even try to answer this we would first need to know what was his idea about what constituted the past.?
