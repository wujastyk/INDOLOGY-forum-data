Offline Sanskrit Resources
Dear Colleagues,
I have a general enquiry about offline Sanskrit resources.
Does anyone know of electronic Sanskrit resources (especially  
searchable grammars and dictionaries) that function offline?
I am interested for myself, but also for my students!
With Thanks and Best Wishes,
