Dear Hal,

I received your query from Elena. Others will be
better poised than I to help you with Chennai and Kolkata
(often said to derive from Kalighat), but
at least one point of interest concerning Bombay/Mumbai
comes to mind.

In a Buddhist tantra called the .Daakaar.nava
(ed. N.N. Chaudhuri, 1935), we find reference to 
a local divinity called (if I remember correctly - I
don't have the text at hand) Mombaadevii, whom Chaudhuri
posited as a first reference to the location that in
his day was officially called Bombay. The language of the
.Daakaar.nava is a variety of Eastern Apabhra.mza,
certainly not Marathi, nor even a direct ancestor
thereof. I don't think that it can be dated precisely,
but ca. 900-1100 would be a good bet. 

Hope this is of some use.
Matthew
