New version of DCS
Dear colleagues,
a new version of the Digital Corpus of Sanskrit has been released. Apart
from some new texts (refer to
http://kjc-fs-cluster.kjc.uni-heidelberg.de/dcs/index.php?contents=help_center),
the corpus now offers a KWIC (key word in context) search function. This
function can be used to examine Sanskrit phraseology or as a starting point
for searching for citations. Please refer to
http://kjc-fs-cluster.kjc.uni-heidelberg.de/dcs/index.php?contents=help_kwic
for further information.
Best regards
