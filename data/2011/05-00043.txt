Jhakataka and bhakataka?
13.5.11
<'Quarrel, conflict', etc, does
seem to fit the context.>
So, if we relate it to jhaga? ?quarrel?(Turner 5321). jhag?? ?--
the supposed NIA ?derivatives? do not have the second vowel of Turner --? can be used almost in almost all NIA
languages. No Sanskrit source finds mention in the CDIAL. An early attested
form seems to have been jhaka?? (Abhidh?naj?jendra). This and Sanskrit jhaka?a (?a?bh???candrik?
ed. Kamala?ankar Dvived? 1909-10) find mention in Vang?ya ?abdakoshHaricharan
Bandyopadhyay, 1932 (rep.1978). Apparently, this is not onomatopoeic.If
the equation stood scrutinyjhaka?aka should have been an extension by
the addition of ?ka.

Thanks again to all who replied to this question. 'Quarrel, conflict', etc, does seem to fit the context.
