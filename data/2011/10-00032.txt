Perhaps tantuv?ya here in the English text is simply a mistake?  The first verse quoted in the footnote uses rather the expression tunnav?ya.

Both words seem to be common and old, but while one expects tunnav?ya to refer to a ?tailor? (see, e.g., Manusm?ti 2.214 and commentaries), one expects tantuv?ya to refer to a weaver (see, e.g., Manusm?ti 8.397 and commentaries).

(See attachment). Has the word 'tantuv?ya' been used in the meaning of 'tailor' anywhere else in Sanskrit?
