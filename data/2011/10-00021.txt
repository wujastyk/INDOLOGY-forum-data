[INDOLOGY] working emails for BORI, Baroda?
Dear all,
The email address on BORI's website<http://www.bori.ac.in/contact.html>, bori1 at vsnl.net<mailto:bori1 at vsnl.net>, doesn't work.
Similarly, most parts of the website of the Oriental Institute in Baroda <http://www.msubaroda.ac.in/oriental/> do not function.  Nor does the email for its director, Professor Wadekar, mlwadekar at hotmail.com<mailto:mlwadekar at hotmail.com>.
Does anyone have confirmed, recent contact email details for these two august institutions?
Thanks,
Dominik
