Thanks for the reference to Scharf & Hyman; this is a fabulous work.

Unfortunately, two mysteries for the Harvard Kyoto transliteration 
convention remain, namely the long vowel "r" (? / ? transliterated as "q" by 
Scharf and Hyman and also, Wujastyk, but as "RR" by others) and the short 
vowel "l" (? /?  transliterated as "L" by Scharf and Hyman and also, 
Wujastyk, but by others as "lR").

I realize that H-K has been superseded by other conventions, but it is 
useful (because of its simplicity) for student e-mails, and also because it 
is used in the on-line Monier Williams dictionary 
(http://gandhari.org/a_mw.php and 
http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/monier/).

Incidentally, the on-line MW uses the "RR" (long vowel "r"; ? / ?) and "lR" 
conventions (short vowel "l"; ? /?).

Any further insights into this would be greatly appreciated.

Generally most comprehensive dealing with different transliteration schemes 
and recently available
online: Scharf/Hyman's "Linguistic issues encoding Sanskrit"
