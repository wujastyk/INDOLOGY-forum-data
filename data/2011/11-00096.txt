[Apologies for cross posting]
Dear All,
I have volumes III and IV of Matsunaga &c. sitting in front of me but
would also very much like to have access to the other three, I, II,
and V. The link at the bottom suggests that there are various complete
holdings in Japan but I am unable to find a complete set outside. Does
anyone know of a non-Japanese institution that holds all five?
