Dear Colleagues,

I am pleased to announce the publication of my monograph:

Religion, Narrative and Public Imagination in South Asia: Past and  
Place in the Sanskrit Mah?bh?rata

London: Routledge, 2012.

ISBN:978-0-415-55863-1 (hbk)
ISBN: 978-0-203-850512-1 (ebk)

This book takes up the origin, form, content and impact of the  
Sanskrit Mah?bh?rata in early South Asia (by exploring the Sanskrit  
text as well as first millennium epigraphy and wider literature). It  
also includes, as an epilogue, a study of the Hindi televisual  
Mah?bh?rat.

I hope those who are interested enjoy it!

With All Best Wishes,

James Hegarty
