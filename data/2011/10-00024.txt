working emails for BORI, Baroda?
Many thanks indeed to everyone who has helped with the query!
The email address on BORI's website <http://www.bori.ac.in/contact.html>,
Recently given by Prof. Thite: bori at dataone.in
This doesn't cause email errors, at least.
Prof. M L Wadekar: mlwadekar2008 at hotmail.com
This works.  Prof. Wadekar and I are in communication.
Many thanks!
