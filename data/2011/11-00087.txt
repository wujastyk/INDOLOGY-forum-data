vedic concordance
Dear list members,
the concordance is still available at:
http://orient.dslo.unibo.it/OSite/vedicconc2005.html
All the files contained in the .zip archive are Unicode compliant (so that you can correctly display them using any Unicode font that includes the necessary latin-character-with-diacritic glyphs), and they comes in .rtf format (the concordance file in .doc format as well), so that you can access them using any word processor, on Mac and Windows machines alike.
Nonetheless, note that this version of the concordance is not the same as the one published in 2007 as HOS 66 (that is copyrighted by HUP); the free downloadable concordance reflects a previous stage of my work (2005), and it lacks the mantras (around 11,000) taken from Baudhayana ?rautas?tra.
Best wishes,
