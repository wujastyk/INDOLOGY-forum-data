Hello Dominik,

I admire your willingness to seek a more generous interpretation of the
passage from Singleton [generosity is a good thing!], but I still don't buy
the idea that the English word 'yoga' is a homonym of the Sansrit word
'yoga.'  The English word is a loanword from Sanskrit.  So, in my view,
there is still only one word here.  'Yoga' in the RV doesn't mean the same
thing as 'yoga' in the Gita, but it is after all the same word, right?  Or
am I just going crazy?

Look, would it be correct to say that the English word 'mantra' is a homonym
of the Sanskrit word 'mantra'?  It doesn't matter that 'mantra' in English
may have a different set of meanings or connotations than the Sanskrit word.

Is the English phrase 'habeas corpus' a homonym of the Latin phrase?

All of this multiplication of words and phrases troubles me.

Otherwise, I'm just fine.

All the best,

George
