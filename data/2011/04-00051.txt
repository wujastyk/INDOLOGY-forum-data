http://www.kss.uni-tuebingen.de/
*Karmendu Shishir Shodhagar (KSS)* is the first international archival
collection of Hindi literary little magazines (*Laghupatrik?s*). The project
aims to digitize, catalogue and document the vibrant literary circles of
North India. Unique to the *Shodhagar *is the attempt to retrieve
now-almost-extinct little Hindi literary magazines and journals (*
Laghupatrik?s*), currently about 4500 issues, covering the period from 1883
to 1947 and from 1947 to 2009.
