Sanskrit Grammar Books
The second edition of Colebrooke's edition of the Amarakosa was published in
Serampore in 1825.  The title page reads:
Kosha or Dictionary of the Sungskrita Language by Umura Singha with an
English Interpretation and Annotations.
with the vowels in the Skt words italicized.  There's a digitized copy of
this in the Digital Library of India.
I don't know the date of the first edition.
Best,
Dominik
