The corresponding suutras of the Kau.siitakag.rhyasuutra are  Ratna  
Gopaala Bha.t.ta's edition (1908: 14) identical with the  
;saa:nkhaayanag.rhyasuutra, but in T. R. Chintamani's edition (1944:  
79) they run as follows with Bhavatraata's commentary:
2.2.8 ga.naanaa.m tveti ga.nakaamam
Bhavatraata: ga.naanaa.m tvety anaya rcaa ga.nakaamam upanayed devasya tveti
2.2.9 aagantaa maa ri.sa.nyateti yaudham
Bhavatraata: upanayed ity evaanu.sa:nga.h
2.2.10 mahaavyaah.rtibhir vyaadhitam
Bhavatraata: upanayed ity evaanu.sa:nga.h

Vaasudeva's ;saa:nkhaayanag.rhyasa:ngraha.h:
...devas tvaa savitu.h prasave ;svinor baahubhyaa.m puu.s.no  
hastaabhyaam upanayaami devadatteti mantra.m  
maa.navakanaamopalak.sita.m japet / atha maa.navakasamuuhaadhipatyam  
icchati tato ga.naanaa.m tvaa ga.napati.m havaamaha ity etaam .rca.m  
japet / aagantaa maa ri.sety anena .rcaa (sic) k.satyiyaan upanayet /  
atha maa.navakas traivar.niko vyaadhito bhavati tato mahaavyaah.rtii;  
catasro japet / o.m bhuu.h o.m bhuva.h o.m sva.h o.m mahar bhuur

trayaa.naam api var.naanaa.m mantre maa.navakanaamoccaarayitavyam /  
apare tv eva.m vyaacak.sate sevasya tvaa savitur ity anena saha  
samuccaya iti / ...

Both Somanaathopaadhyaaya (1908: 29) and Ganga Sagar Rai (1995: 30)  
have maa.navakasamuuhaadhipatyam icchati, but one should undoubtedly  
read maa.navake samuuhaadhipatyam icchati, or maa.navaka.h  
samuudhaadhipatyam icchati (this latter reading is in line with atha  
maa.navakas traivar.niko vyaadhito bhavati).

With best wishes, also for a Happy Christmas and New Year, Asko Parpola
