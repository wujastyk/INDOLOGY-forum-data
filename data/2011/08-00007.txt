taxonomy question
CU 5.10.8 sets up a taxonomy of sorts in its reference to the ?small things? (kshudrANi) that continually live and die in the round of rebirth, in distinction to men who attain one of the two paths after death (path of the gods, path of the fathers).

Re: [INDOLOGY] taxonomy question
Thanks Adheesh, I'd forgotten about "car?cara" (mobile/immobile), and thanks for the reference.
Can we state then that what we modern folks call inanimate objects, as well as plants, fit the acara category, and then all animals and humans fit the cara category?  Or are there other distinctions?
My linguist colleague has clarified that she's looking specifically for the linguistic taxonomy of this.
Cheers
James

  Dear James,
  In the epics, the phrase "car?cara" (mobile/immobile) is quite common--see for example Bhagavad-g?t? 10.39:
  yac c?pi sarvabh?t?n?? b?ja? tad aham arjuna |
  na tad asti vin? yat sy?n may? bh?ta? car?caram ||
  All best wishes,
