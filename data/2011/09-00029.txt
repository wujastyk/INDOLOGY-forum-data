Subject: Harvard Rigveda files in Unicode?

oh, I see.  That's not working.

I've put the files here: http://db.tt/CZBj8sr

(I went to the WayBack machine, and fetched them from the Harvard website as
it was in about 2004).

I shall remove the files from the link above in a few days.  Would the
webmaster of the Harvard site kindly fix it so the files are accessible
again?

Dominik
