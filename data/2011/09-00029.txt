Harvard Rigveda files in Unicode?
oh, I see.  That's not working.
I've put the files here: http://db.tt/CZBj8sr
(I went to the WayBack machine, and fetched them from the Harvard website as
it was in about 2004).
I shall remove the files from the link above in a few days.  Would the
webmaster of the Harvard site kindly fix it so the files are accessible
again?
