Wonderful!  We have now established that the distinguished Gosain Anand 
Ghan (with name garbled in the colonial record and probably secondarily 
misread) was one of the first slate of pandits named professors at 
Banaras Sanskrit College.  Could we also track the achievements of some 
of his colleagues?  In addition to the first principal, Kashinath, who 
had been Charles Wilkins's pandit in Banaras, and who, in spite of what 
I once stated, was not Kashmiri, but Bengali, we have the following cast 
in Nicholls' list:
1. *Bireshur Sheth *Professor or Teacher of the large Vyakarana of 
Paniniand of the Bhasya of the Rigveda.
2. *Ram Chandr Tara *Professor or Teacher of the Veda and Vedanta.
3. *Ramprashad Tarka Panchanan *Professor of the Nyaya Shastra.
4. *Soolepa Shastri *Professor of the Mimansa
5. *Gosain Anand Gir*Professor of the Purans and Cabe Shastra.
6. *Luchmiput Joshi * Professor of the Jotish Shastra.
7. *Gangaram Bhat *Professor of the Vaya Shastra.
8. *Shyamanand Bhattacharji*, Professor or Teacher of Dharma Shastra.
son of Cashinath.
