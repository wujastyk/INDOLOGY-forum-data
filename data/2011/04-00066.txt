The verse occurs in several of the Vik?ti works collected in K. V.
Abbhyankar and G. V. Devasthali, *Vedavik?tilak?a?a-Sa?graha (a collection
of twelve tracts on Vedavik?tis and allied topics)* (Poona: BORI, 1978).
E.g.,
   - 1. Vy??ik?t? Vik?tivall? v.5 (of 28 verses total), and discussed in the
   commentary on this work, Vik?tikaumud?, by Ga?g?dharabha???c?rya.
   - A??avik?tilak?a??ni, v. 1.  Unique MS copied in AD 1904.
   -  Ja??pa?alak?rik?vy?khy?, v.2.  Unique undated MS (therefore to be
   assumed to be early 19th century).
   - Hayagr?vak?ta? Ja??pa?alam and commentaries - generally not mentioned.
   - Madhus?danamaskarin's A??avik?tiviv?ti, verse 3.   Datable MSS of this
   work from AD 1790 onwards.
   - Kau??inya?ik?? - no.
   - Kramapa?ala - no.
   - ?kpr?ti??khya 3 with Uva?a - no.
   - Jayantasv?min's Svar??ku?a - no.
So, the general picture is that there are roughly three main traditions of
these texts.  Those derived from a Vy??i, those named after Hayagr?va, and
those associated with Pr?ti??khya and ?ik?? texts.  The verse in question
occurs in the first tradition, and not in the others.
Abhyankar and Devasthali's claims that this Vy??i is the ancient authority
mentioned in the Mah?bh??ya are to be discounted.
