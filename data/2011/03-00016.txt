Yoga Body, a book by Mark Singleton
Dear List,
Is this not just a reflection of the old idea that the form yoga can be derived from what have long been judged to be different verbal roots ? 
Commentators tend to defend their view of what yoga really is by quoting (from the Dh?tup??ha) either
yujir yoge  
or
yuja sam?dhau.
Theistic commentators tend to favour the former (e.g. the tenth-century Kashmirian N?r?ya?aka??ha commenting on M?gendratantra, yogap?da 2) .  Historical linguists may not believe these to be properly separate roots, but the view that yoga and yoga can be homophones appears to be quite an old one.
