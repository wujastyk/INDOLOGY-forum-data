Dear Dominik,

The timing seems to be connected with the progress
of the ambitious state-sponsored project of 
photographing and registering every scrap of
Sanskrit preserved in the Tibetan Autonomous Region.

Though access to these materials will no doubt remain
difficult for some time, the results of the overall
project, in the form of handlists or catalogues, will
no doubt begin to become available over the coming years.

best,
Matthew
