Dear All,


Has someone actually seen the book:

V. Smith (ed.) Edicts of Asoka (Sanskrit Edition)


 http://www.amazon.com/dp/8121505895/ref=rdr_ext_sb_ti_hist_3


I want to buy it, provided, however, it's really a translation of
Asoka Edicts into Sanskrit.

The paperback editions of the book do not contain any Sanskrit
translations, just plain English in fancy fonts.


Thank you and regards,

Artur Karp
