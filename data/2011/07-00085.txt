A Question
Dear All,
Has someone actually seen the book:
V. Smith (ed.) Edicts of Asoka (Sanskrit Edition)
 http://www.amazon.com/dp/8121505895/ref=rdr_ext_sb_ti_hist_3
I want to buy it, provided, however, it's really a translation of
Asoka Edicts into Sanskrit.
The paperback editions of the book do not contain any Sanskrit
translations, just plain English in fancy fonts.
Thank you and regards,
Artur Karp
