Porunthal: dating of paddy in the 5th century B.C. and              possible consequences on the evaluation of the history of writing              in India
Dear Jean-Luc,
Thank you very much (I had already replied to you offlist), I shall go through this publication.
Of course, I am greatly looking forward to know the argument of the eminent archaeologist Prof. K. Rajan in favour of distinguishing this particular piece of evidence from so-called "potter's marks" (which is not a very suitable term since we do not know whether it was really the potter who has applied them).
Best wishes,
Corinna

Dear Corinna,
are you perhaps referring to the kind of "signs"
which are discussed by K.Rajan in a 2001 article
(in a volume edited by ye.cupparAyalu and Ce. irAvu)
The title of the article is
"paNTai kuRiyITukaLum eZuttukkaLum"
(ancient signs/symbols and letters)
I attach it as a scanned PDF
(it seems to fall within fair use,
because the volume is difficult to find)
Since, obviously,
K.Rajan knows the difference
between symbols and letters,
I wonder why he decided in this case (in Porunthal)
that we have "letters" and not "symbols" (or potters' marks).
Best wishes
