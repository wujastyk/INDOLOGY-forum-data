looking for book "Goraksh Kimayagar"
A patron in India is looking for a book in Marathi or Hindi of the above title, which I am unable to find (under any plausible spelling in Nagari or romanization) in any bibliographies of the Gorakh Panth, nor in WorldCat.  Has anyone ever heard of it?
Thanks,
Allen
