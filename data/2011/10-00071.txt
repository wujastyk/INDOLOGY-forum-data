Porunthal: dating of paddy in the 5th century B.C. and              possible consequences on the evaluation of the history of writing              in India
Dear Dr. Chevillard,
I submit this with hesitation and prior apology because I am no expert on ancient Tamil scripts. But in the few specimens I have (like A.H.Dani 
Oxford 1963 whose 'plates' are printed on horribly poor quality papers, 
V.Kannaiyan and a few like material) the early Tamil va is not a diamond . It may be a sharp triangle or triangle with round edge and an 
antenna. Do we have evidence to identify the initial sign as a va?
Best

Dear Corinna Wessels-Mevissen,
can you explain more in details
why you are sceptical with the decipherment
"va-y(a)-ra".
Every comment is important, at this stage, ...
Best wishes

 confidence that Raja Raja Chola's va is not like the inital diamond. I have no idea about RRC's ba of which I have no specimen. The basic problem may be attempted from this meagre evidence, I think.
