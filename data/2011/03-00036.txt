I have looked through the on line-archive of this journal but this paper was not there.Any other enlightening materials on this difficult subject are also welcome! I am trying to write an entry about this subject for the Encyclopedia of Buddhist Philosophy which is under preparation in my Institute, but the more I read the less I understand: those whom I believed to be nirakaravadins seem to be sakaravadins, and vice versa.Best regards,Victoria LysenkoResearch Professor,Institute of PhilosophyRussian Academy of SciencesMoscow
