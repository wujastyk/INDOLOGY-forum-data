No incoming Sanskrit students at Andhra University :-(
I was there as a student in the Wisconsin program 30+ years ago (actually in Telugu, but Sanskrit and Telugu were housed together).  It was a pretty lively place back then...
Has there been a similar dwindling of Sanskrit students at other large Indian public universities?
