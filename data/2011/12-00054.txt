Dear colleagues,
I post this on behalf of Dr. Clemency Montelle of Christchurch, New
Zealand. Please circulate as widely as possible.

Announcement of a PhD Scholarship in the History of Mathematical Sciences
in India
An international project on the history of computational methods in
Sanskrit mathematical science has been awarded a three-year grant from
New Zealand's premier fund for research excellence, the Marsden Fund
Council, administered by the Royal Society of New Zealand.

As part of the activities of this project, the investigators are
offering a doctoral study and research opportunity with the title
'Research Associate' carrying three years of full support for
2012-2014 for the completion of a doctoral degree at the University of
Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand (http://www.canterbury.ac.nz/)**.
The scholarship will provide an annual living allowance/stipend of
NZ$25,000 and tuition costs for three years, and is tenable for study
towards the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in the appropriate
department or program (for example, the Department of Mathematics and
Statistics or the History and Philosophy of Science program) on the
topic of the history of mathematical sciences.
The Research Associate will research and write under the supervision
of the Principal Investigator a PhD thesis relating to the project
goals, e.g., a critical edition with translation and commentary of a
previously unpublished text on Sanskrit computational astronomy. He or
she is also expected to assist (at a workload of 12 hours per week)
with project related research tasks.
The successful applicant will meet the following criteria at the time
of appointment:
*attainment of a sufficiently advanced level of study (preferably a
Master's degree) to permit completion of the doctorate within the
three years of the project.
* sufficient knowledge of and interest in some combination of relevant
fields of study, within history of the mathematical sciences and/or
Indology, to design and complete under the supervisor's guidance a
doctoral thesis relating to the project's objectives.
* initiative and adaptability to carry out tasks in the Research
Associate workload.
* ability to enroll in the PhD programme at the University of
Canterbury, including a minimum of eight to nine months per year
residence in Christchurch, New Zealand to pursue their studies.
With the approval of the Principal Investigator, this position may be
held concurrently with any other scholarship, award, or bursary,
excluding any such award requiring teaching or other duties separate
from this project.
