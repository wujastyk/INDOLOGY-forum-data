A search of Google Books leads to a reference to a translation of the
Matsya Puraan.a into Persian by "the braahman.a Gosain Anandghan of
Delhi, resident of Benares" in Heinrich von Stietencron, et al. Epic and
Puraan.ic Bibliography (up to 1985)... Harrasowitz, Wiesbaden: 1992, pp.
87-88, entry no. 480 (A. Bausani, "Notizia di una tradizione persiana
inedita del Matsyapuraan.a della fine del secolo 18," RSO 31 [1956],

Dear Dr. D'Onofrio,
Thank you for this reference. This would indeed very likely be the  
author in question. I should perhaps have noted that in his preface to 
the translation he describes himself as having come from "Dehly" but  
has having spent much time in V?van.
