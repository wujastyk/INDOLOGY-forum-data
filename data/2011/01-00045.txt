religious embryology in India
Dear Andrey,
I don't have any kind of complete bibliography, but here are a few ideas:
On Fertility: 
-Allocco, A. (2009). Snakes, goddesses, and anthills: Modern challenges and women's ritual responses in contemporary south india. Thesis, Emory University.
-Balzani, M. (2004). Pregnancy rituals amongst the rajput elite in contemporary rajasthan. Playing for Real: Hindu Role Models, Religion, and Gender, 141.
-Parpola, A. (1987). Bangles, sacred trees, and fertility: Interpretations of the indus script relating to the cult of skanda-kum?ra. In South asian archaeology 1987: Proceedings of the ninth international conference of the association of south asian archaeologists in western europe.
-Patton Laurie, L. (2002). Mantras and miscarriage: Controlling birth in the late vedic period. Jewels of Authority: Women and Textual Tradition in Hindu India, 51-56.
Little of the vast medieval literature on this topic has been edited.  Look in the NGMCP catalogue for the word "s?tik?" for instance.
Prenatal and Childhood demonic possession:
Filliozat, J. (n.d.). Etude de d?monologie indienne: Le kumaratantra de ravan. A et les textes paralleles indiens tib?tains, chinois, cambodgien et arabe. Cahiers De La Soci?t? Asiatique, Series, 1.
Granoff (2002). Paradigms of protection in ancient india or an essay on what to do with your demons. Essays in Jaina Philosophy and Religion, 2, 181-212.
Granoff (2009). The art of protecting children: The ritual context for some early terracottas.
Sarma, E. M. K. (1975). Kum?ratantram. South Indian Archaka Association.
Smith, F. M. (2006). The Self Possessed: Deity and spirit possession in south asian literature and civilization. New York: Columbia University Press.
Wujastyk, D. (1999). Miscarriages of justice: Demonic vengeance in classical indian medicine. Religion, Health, and Suffering, 256-75.
Ditto concerning the lack of work on primary sources for this topic.  There are dozens of manuscripts on it in every archive in South Asia.  
The Kriy?k?lagu?ottara has the following chapters that may be of interest:
-abhi?ekapa?ala 19 (on possession causing fertility problems and remedies)
-s?tikopadrava 20
-j?tam?trab?lacikits? 21
-b?l?n?? cikits? 22
-b?lagrahacikits? 23
-rak??pa?ala 24 (protection charms for children and others)
There is a lot of Ayurvedic material on this--the K??yapasa?hit? comes to mind--but you don't get as much of the religious perspective there as the sources I mentioned above.
Good luck,
