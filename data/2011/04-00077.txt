Identification of rivers
Dear list,
In a chapter on micro/macrocosmic equivalents in the  
Siddhasiddh?ntapaddhati, which, because of parallel passages in other  
works, I suspect has at least a connection with Kashmir, we find the  
following list of nine rivers:
p?nas? yamun? ga?g? candrabh?g? sarasvat?|
vip??? ?atarudr? ca ?r?r?tri? caiva narmad? ||3.11||
The inclusion of the Candrabh?g? ( = Chenab ) and Vip??? ( =  
Beas ) with the more famous Yamun?, Ga?g?, Sarasvat? and Narmad?  
bolsters the Kashmir hypothesis. I am yet to identify the remaining  
three rivers, P?nas?, ?atarudr? and ?r?r?tri. There is a variant  
p?t?sa for p?nas? and it has been suggested that they might be  
corruptions of Vitast? ( = Jhelum). ?atarudr? might be a corruption  
of ?atadru ( = Sutlej). I have no ideas for ?r?r?tri; if the  
emendation ?atadru is correct, the ?dr? ca could be a corruption of  
part of the river?s name.
Any suggestions gratefully received.
Yours,
Jim Mallinson
