Dear Dr. Kaul,

A few years back Madame Kapila Vatsyayana
gave an interesting lecture in Paris on 
Hindu temples in Kashmir. I am not sure if
she has published anything about it yet, but
you may wish to try to contact her. (I regret that I do not
have her contact information at hand.)

Perhaps this might be of some help.

Sincerely,
