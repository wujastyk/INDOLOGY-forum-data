Kharia, spoken in central-eastern India, is a member of the southern
branch of the Munda family, which forms the western branch of the
Austro-Asiatic phylum, stretching from central India to Vietnam. The
present study provides the most extensive description of Kharia to date
and covers all major areas of the grammar. Of particular interest in the
variety of Kharia described here is that there is no evidence for assuming
the existence of parts-of-speech such as noun, adjective and verb. Rather
functions such as reference, modification and predication are expressed by
one of two syntactic structures, referred to here as ?syntagmas?. The
volume will be of equal interest to general linguists from the fields of
typology, linguistic theory, areal linguistics, Munda linguistics as well
as South Asianists in general.
