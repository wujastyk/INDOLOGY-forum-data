Dear list memebers,

I am proud to announce the following recent publication which may be of
interest to some members of this list:

A Grammar of Kharia
A South Munda Language
John Peterson

Publication year: 2011
ISBN: 978 90 04 18720 7

Cover: Hardback
Number of pages: xxiv, 474 pp.
List price: ? 152.00 / US$ 216.00
Series: Brill's Studies in South and Southwest Asian Languages, 1

Kharia, spoken in central-eastern India, is a member of the southern
branch of the Munda family, which forms the western branch of the
Austro-Asiatic phylum, stretching from central India to Vietnam. The
present study provides the most extensive description of Kharia to date
and covers all major areas of the grammar. Of particular interest in the
variety of Kharia described here is that there is no evidence for assuming
the existence of parts-of-speech such as noun, adjective and verb. Rather
functions such as reference, modification and predication are expressed by
one of two syntactic structures, referred to here as ?syntagmas?. The
volume will be of equal interest to general linguists from the fields of
typology, linguistic theory, areal linguistics, Munda linguistics as well
as South Asianists in general.
