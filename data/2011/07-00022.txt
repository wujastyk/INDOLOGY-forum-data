promptness of Hindu funerals
It may be worth recalling in this regard that, 
after the massacre of the Nepalese royal family
some years ago, one of the complaints that was
much aired was that the requirement of swift cremation
precluded the possibility of proper autopsies. The
physical evidence that might have corroborated or
called into question the narratives of the event
was thereby irrevocably lost.
