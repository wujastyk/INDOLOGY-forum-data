Dear friends,

I can inform of some names and
publications but am unable to provide any internet link.

Sitanath Acharya: ?Modern Sanskrit
literature and contemporary society? pp.14-26, Sanskrit Studies Modern
Sensibilities UGC-Academic Staff College and Department of Sanskrit,
University of Calcutta, April 2004. The article is in Bengali but the
bibliographical details of cited publications are in English

Dipak
Ghosh ?Sanskrit Sensitivities with reference to two modern Sanskrit
Lyrics?Vil?papa?cik? and R?jan?til?m?tam? ibid pp.153-160.

Both the
above authors themselves wrote many poems in Sanskrit.

The most
successful Sanskrit poet in twentieth century Bengal was ?r?j?va Ny?yat?rtha whose books are available in print with the
two or three traditional dealers in Sanskritic books in Calcutta. 

In the
nineties there were some attempts to start projects on modern creative Sanskrit
literature in some Universities of South Bengal and by some interested
persons.? I cannot inform on their
results. As far as I remember Dr. Rita Chatterjee of the Jadavpur University
was sometimes engaged in research on twentieth century Sanskrit
literature. Perhaps, herself not a creative
writer she looked informative to me. She might have brought about some publications
on the subject.

Best 

DB
