Shakespeare in Sanskrit?
I know of the following two translations of Shakespeare into Sanskrit:
1. A Midsummer Night's Dream: Krishnamachari,R. "Vasantikaswapnam: An 
Adaptation of Shakespeare's Midsummer-Night's Dream" (Madras, 1892).
2. Hamlet: Sukhamoy Mukhopadhyay, D?n?rkar?jakum?ra-Hemalekham (Delhi: 
Motilal Banarsidass, 1971).
Does anyone know of other examples?
Thanks
