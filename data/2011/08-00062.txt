Asoka: Roads and Animals
Tangentially. Why are bulls so omnipresent in the store of Sanskrit metaphors?
Is it because of their sexual provess?
Or - because they are alpha-males par excellence? Then - reproductors,
yes, but first of all leaders, leaders of the herds.
Herds observed while just grazing on some pasture? Or, rather, herds
in movement, with an alpha-bull in the lead?
