There's some very interesting material on this topic in both the Tibetan and Ayurvedic medical literature.  

I don't have my textbooks at hand, so I can't provide references.

Some years back, when we were PhD students together, Amy Langenberg (Brown University) was interested in this topic, so she may be able to help.  

I will also be interested in any electronic references the list members might provide.

Cheers
