Subject: What's the difference between Arabic and Sanskrit
Message-ID: <161227093962.23782.8196155877815504536.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Also ...

do not forget that it will soon (in one or two years' time)
be possible to easily have the equivalent Sanskrit sentences in the 
GRANTHA script,a very beautiful script !!!

It is of course already possible, although tricky,
(SEE:

"http://www.virtualvinodh.com/download/Grantha%20Script%20Lessons.pdf")

and SEE:

"http://tamilonline.com/thendral/Auth.aspx?id=131&cid=4&aid=7420&m=m&template=n"

(that is a recent interview [in TAMIL] by the (YOUNG) author of the 
grantha reader, to which the FIRST link points).

It will become easy in the future to use grantha, thanks to a few 
bright people, helped by a few persistent people.


Cheers
