Fwd: Re: [INDOLOGY] default reply behaviour (was: curses)
But the problem, Frank, was that these weren't infrequent at all (a few a month, at the least; right before the change, several within hours).  As I said then, of the 8 or so professional lists I belong to (some moderated, some not; some with 'reply to list,' some not), I had never received anywhere near the number of accidental emails (or radically inappropriate emails for public consumption) as on this one.
But, at the end of the day, I can live with either system (I did what Tim does and will do it again should we change back).
My best,
Steven
