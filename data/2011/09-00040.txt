The same holds good for the Gopatha-Br?hma?a and the two
V?jasaneya-Sa?hit?s. A M?dhyandina-Samhit? with Hindi commentary is available
but more valuable will be the text with Uva?a and Mah?dhara. The Gopatha-Br?hma?a
has been kindly made available by Gretil but it is incomplete. I have only a
J?v?nanda Vidy?s?gara edition which is not very dependable and is already 12
decades old. The two critical editions are out of print. 
The K??va ?.B. is available in print with S?ya?a?s
commentary but not with Gretil.

[INDOLOGY] accented ?B files in Unicode?
In a similar vein, does anyone know if there is a downloadable transliterated unicode version of the ?atapatha Br?hma?a (accented, in either recension)?? I am aware of GRETIL's version of M (no accents), JR Gardner's vedavid.org version, and the TITUS accented version of M (which is what I often use, but it is not downloadable as far as I can tell; K is listed as in preparation).
I hadn't searched for this in a long time, but in doing so now I was pleased to find that archive.org has a full scan of Eggeling's translation.
Best,
