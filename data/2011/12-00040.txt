The free indological collection
I was just searching online for a text, and I came across "The Free
Indological Collection."
(http://www.archive.org/details/freeindological)  The number of texts
available seems impressive.
I had not heard of this project before, and I did not find information
of significance online about it.  Does anyone have any more
information on this project?
Thanks,
