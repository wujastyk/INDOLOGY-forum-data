Yoga Body, a book by Mark Singleton
With caveats that I have not read Singleton's work, and that generally I try to stay away from yoga and yog?s as much as I can, I just wanted to point out what I've always thought to be a fascinating linguistic feature of modern Marathi:
In contemporary Marathi there are, in fact, two distinct heterophones: 'yog' (with meanings of 'opportunity', 'chance', 'fortuity', and so on) and 'yog?', pronounced with a long vowel (but still masculine in gender) and bearing only the meaning of English "yoga" as exercise. One never uses the former for the latter or vice versa. I'm not sure exactly how this 'yog?' would be written in newspapers and so on, but would not be surprised to find it appearing as "????". (indeed there are numerous hits on Google for '????'). 
It seems safe to say that this latter "Yog?" in Marathi is a double-borrowing--first borrowed into English from Sanskrit (or perhaps S. Indian languages) and then re-imported into Marathi, whereupon it acquired both the distinct long vowel and a place in the language as a distinct word. A linguistic case of the "Pizza Effect" if you will.
