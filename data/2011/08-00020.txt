taxonomy question
Dear Elisa,
thanks for explaining and for the reference!
In the Buddhist sources (e.g., Sa?g?tis?tra and commentaries,
AKBh), yoni is not a synonym of the jar?yu kind of birth, but all
four items are considered ?yonis? in a more general meaning of
?kind of birth.? This generalization of the term for a generative
organ from the animal (and human) kingdom suggests that plants
were not a concern of the creators of this variant of the list.
All best,
Stefan
