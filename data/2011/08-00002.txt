taxonomy question
HI
A colleague has asked me the following question, and I thought some on this
list might readily know the answer:
'Do you have in Sanskrit a conceptual dichotomy that corresponds to
living/non-living or animate/inanimate?
What exactly does the taxonomy look like? (is the opposition something like
human vs. animals vs plants vs material objects, or human and animal vs.
plants vs material objects or human and animal and plant vs. material
objects, or otherwise?)'
