CALL FOR EXPRESSION OF INTEREST> BRILL's _Index Buddhicus_              (Classified Bibliography of Buddhist Studies)
Dear Colleagues,
BRILL is preparing a classified bibliography of Buddhist Studies, the
Index Buddhicus. The Index will describe material ranging from
articles, papers and chapters appearing in journals, proceedings and
collections, through monographs, editions and theses, to digital
resources. All entries will be classified and cross referenced to
related material. The index will be available online, and probably
also in hard copy.
In preparation, we are currently forming a group of editors, including
four specialist / area editors. We would like to receive expressions
of interest from those with a background in two of these -- admittedly
loose -- categories:
* Art / Culture / Education / ...
* Literature / Texts / ...
* Philosophy / Psychology / ...
* State / Society / ...
* Religious Life / Discipline / Rituals / ...
* India / Nepal
* Tibet / Central Asia
* China / Japan / Korea / ...
* `Western' Buddhism: US / UK / ...
Once a suitable group has been formed there will be a meeting in
Leiden to plan the development of the Index. It is anticipated that
BRILL's Index Islamicus will be used as a model:

Could those interested in possible involvement please send their
enquires to me. I'd be happy to provide details and field questions.
