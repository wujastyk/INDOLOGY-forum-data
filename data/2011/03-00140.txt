help with Sinhala script mss
The Library of Congress has about 20 manuscripts in Sinhala script; we have no idea whether they are in Pali, Sinhala, or Sanskrit.  They have been completely digitized in a rough and ready way (color *.jpg images with a small digital camera), but not one suitable for mounting on the Web.  Would anyone here be interested in having a look at them if I send CDs of the digital files, and perhaps, if they are not too difficult or uninteresting, filling out a simple worksheet for each, with the aim of creating from the worksheets Minimal Level Records to be put on our OPAC?
Even an authoritative identification of the language would be a boon, because we could create for each a skeleton in-process record for language, script, and physical description to notify scholars of the mss's presence.
These are NOT in Poleman's Census.
