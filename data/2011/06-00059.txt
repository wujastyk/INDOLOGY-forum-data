Obituary for Lucy Bulliet
May I ask, will her valuable Bibliography be published in another
obituary? 
Or is there one somewhere on Columbia's website?
Thanks,
Joanna Kirkpatrick

[INDOLOGY] Obituary for Lucy Bulliet
It is with great sadness that I pass along this obituary for Lucy
Bulliet, which was written by her husband Professor Richard
Bulliet of Columbia University.
