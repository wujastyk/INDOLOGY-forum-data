The City in Sanskrit literature
Dear Dr. Taylor,
Had we some exchanges on some related topic before? I do not know if I 
told you that there is an extensive study by me of the rise and decline 
of the early historical cities, particularly of Hastinapura. The problem
 is that the study is in Bengali. If your student read Bengali, I could 
send a copy to him.
