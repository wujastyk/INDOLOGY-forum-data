Sanskrit tatoo fail
McComas, et al:
This tattoo belongs to Katie Perry (a pop singer), and matches the tattoo on her husband, the actor/comedian Russell Brand.  One of my students pointed out this tattoo to me a few years ago, and I too looked at the ?pravaaha? and thought the artist forgot to decline the noun.  A better image, however shows that it is not pravaaha, but ?pravaaham??the tattoo artist used (improperly) the anusvara to indicate the final of the accusative.  The grammar is still creaky: ?One must go to the river????

[INDOLOGY] Sanskrit tatoo fail
Colleagues - I thought this might amuse you.
My sharp-eyed daughter spotted this tatoo and asked me what is meant:

I looked at  anugacchatu prav?ha, and came up with the nonsensical 'let he/she/it follow' + 'O current'
On being informed, my daughter, with Gen-Y insight, immediately said, 'O right - she probably meant "Go with the flow".'
Such are the dangers of D-I-Y Sanskrit translations.
