Addition: Margaret Cone in her Dictionary of Pali, Vol. 1, s.v. ?malaka-mutt? has "a kind of pearl from Sri Lanka" (reference to Sp  75,3), and s.v. ?malaka-va??amuttaratana "a kind of pearl (round as an ?malaka fruit?)" (reference Ja V 380,6),

> Reading once more through this interesting thread, I was just wondering: Schmidt's Nachtr?ge to the Petersburg Dictionary reports ?malaka in the meaning "rock crystal". Two passages in Somadevas?ri's Ya?astilaka (K?vyam?l? vol. 70) are given as evidence (vol. II 28,4 and 209,6; this is available at http://www.dli.ernet.in/). Not too much evidence, but there might be more, and it might have been overlooked so far, who knows.

The basic text has "hatthagat?malak? viya honti"; the ??k? then runs: *hatthagat?* hatthapavi??h? *?malak? viya* suddhama?ik? viya honti.

See Dharmottara's Ny?yabindu??k? ad Ny?yabindu 1.11 (cited according to p. 69,1f. from Dalsukhbhai Malvania's edition of the Dharmottaraprad?pa): karatal?malakavad bh?vyam?nasya arthasya yad dar?ana? tad yogina? pratyak?am | tad dhi sphu??bham | Roughly: "Yogic perception is the seeing of an object that is contemplated upon like an ?malaka in one's hand, for it has a clear appearance."

> 
> On the face of it, the rock crystal makes in this particlar context better sense than the myrobalan fruit. The idea is that the yogin contemplates an object, which in the process becomes clear and vivid to him, as clear and vivid as a piece of rock-crystal in one's hand. More precisely: the rock-crystal as a thing exemplifies clarity and vividness more directly than the myrobalan fruit.

> And now, I suppose, one would have to look closer at the finer structure of ?malaka-similes. Is something said to be as self-evident as the SEEING of the ?malaka in one's hand? What is the role of the ?malaka being placed in one's hand? (I suppose: the object is close to the observer, and so this proximity would further accentuate the self-evidence.) Does the comparison attach to features of the ?malaka as such? Are there any features of the ?malaka that make it clearer in your hand than other fruits? (Colour?) Any commentarial explanations of this?
> 
> Maybe the example underwent some changes (in Sanskritic traditions or between Sanskrit and Tibetan, who knows). Epistemological discussions of yogic perception, for instance, might in the eyes of some interpreters have called for a sharper analogy that highlights the clarity of an object-appearance - and makes the object itself clear and vivid and (coincidentally?) translucent.

> The `Tibetan idea' of transparency could have been induced by passages such as the first one (note that `sa ler' is ambivalent, it can mean both `entirely' and `clearly'). Well, by using the word induced I guess I do find myself more in agreement with what Dominik Wujastyk wrote below.

> Emblics are a common fruit in South Asia, and have been so for over two millennia.  The word "emblic" was very common in English amongst the British in India, as it was a well-known, fruit often consumed daily. Many references in Hobson-Jobson<http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?p.1:242.hobson> (who also asserts on good authorities that Skt. ?malaka is the origin of the name of the Malay city Malacca!).  My subjective impression is that British Indian authors referred to emblics more or less as one might today refer to an apple.  "Emblic" wasn't at all a rare word (or fruit).

(I also think that the idea that something with an exterior can in some sense be explained by reference to its inner structure is probably a rather modern idea, and probably not Sanskritic at all.  At the very least, it should be questioned, as a concept.  Ask, with what vocabularly would such a concept be expressed in Sanskrit?)

However, two Tibetan colleagues both asserted that the ?malak? fruit, as understood in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition at least, is a translucent fruit which reveals its inner structure to the subject (not my personal experience with the contemporary version of Amalaki fruit).  Thus for a situation to be "like an ?malak? fruit in one's own hand" means one is able to see the referent inside and out, that is, in totality.  My question then is this:  is this analogy common in Indic traditions and, more importantly, are there any known references to these properties of the ?malak? in Sanskrit works?
