[...] From its North Indian origins Buddhism expanded across much
of Asia, including Southern India, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan,
Central Asia and Tibet, Southeast Asia, China, Korea and Japan.
In contrast to studies of 'Chinese' Buddhism or 'Vietnamese'
Buddhism, this project focuses on the early medieaval monastic
institutions across the entire Buddhist world.
During the first 18 months of work conducted via the Internet
from three different time-zones in the USA and Australia, we have
constructed a freely accessible online database of easily
correctable information on over 500 Asian monastic institutions.
The data include
their: (1) exact geographical coordinates; (2) official and
variant names; (3) probable doctrinal affiliations; (4)
architectural form;
(5) probable organizational characteristics; (6) probable
chronology and dating. Each monastery is linked directly to its
position in GoogleEarth, allowing an overall or close up view of
the site. Many sites have embedded photos of architectural
features.

In September 2010 we have now begun the second phase of the
project: 
recording evidence of bilateral connections between monasteries,
such as the longstanding links between Sri Lankan monasteries and
Nalanda.

What, however, were the overall Asian patterns? How did
long-distance flows of students, teachers, relics, books,
sculpture, paintings and donations influence intellectual,
religious, artistic, even economic and political developments?
What were the main types and styles of inter-monastic Buddhist
communications [= exchanges of information, in oral and written
formats], contacts [= flows of personnel] and affinities [=
political, doctrinal, intellectual and artistic links and
parallels]? Did they significantly vary with changes to their
geographical, cultural, political, or temporal contexts?
In other words, the project systematically documents, maps and
explores the intimate contours of a closely interlinked and
mutually influential Buddhist world.
We invite interested scholars to critique our efforts so-far, to
contribute new data or refinements, and to join our online team."
