Burgess: Tamil and Sanskrit Inscriptions
it seems that this book is currently being scanned at the library in Goettingen:
http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/index.php?id=146&ppn=PPN641186703
or
http://opac.sub.uni-goettingen.de:80/DB=1/SET=5/TTL=1/SHW?FRST=1
probably, one can contact them and ask for a guesstimate about how long it will take before letting anyone else double their efforts. (with some luck, such an inquiry might even accelerate the digitalization)
