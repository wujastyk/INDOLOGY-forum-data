Looking for students?
Dear Jean-Luc,
I fail to see the relevance of your "bold" question. The fact is, I  
think, that fewer and fewer students want to take up Indian,  
especially classical Indian studies on a graduate level, since the  
job market is very restricted. It doesn't matter into which category  
the students happen to fall. Another sad fact is that more and more  
universities are into the numbers' game, i.e. the administrative  
authorities want to see large(r) classes, even on a graduate level. I  
believe that is what Dominik is
implying.
Best
