hotel in Mumbai
My wife will be in Mumbai in late January for three days, on her way to
another destination. She wants to spend 3 nights in Mumbai fairly near the
Gateway of India in order to visit Elephanta and recover from jet lag. The
Taj Mahal is quite expensive, and I'm wondering if anyone has other
suggestions.
Appreciate any help,
Al Collins
