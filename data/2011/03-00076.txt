Dear List,

This is what I meant to send to the list, and not just to Frank.  Sorry for
the little mistake.

Dear Frank,

I do think that "yogaslavia" may be the better reading here.  On the other
hand, the term "yogaslavia" may refer instead to the state of California,
where I lived for nearly 20 years, and where yogaslavians outnumbered the
state's two major political parties by far.  And they still do.

So, is the first member of this compound a loanword from Sanskrit, or is it
some kind of homonym of itself?  And what exactly is the etymology of the
second member?

In any case, after studying yoga for a few years in San Francisco in the
70's, I quickly realized that I was much more interested in words [Sanskrit
ones, of course, among many others] than in asanas.  And so I became a
Vedicist instead of a yogin.
Best,
George

p.s. the new from Japan keeps on getting worser and worser.... it is vey
upsetting!
