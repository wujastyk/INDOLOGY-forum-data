Expert on Kashmir Architecture
I happened to be in the IGNCA, New Delhi, today and was chatting with Dr
Virendra Bangroo (virendrabangroo at gmail.com).  He has published on the
architecture of the Kashmir Valley.  See, e.g.,
http://www.cultorweb.com/Kashmir/KC.html, and
http://ignca.nic.in/bangru01.htm etc.
