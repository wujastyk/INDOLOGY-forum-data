Dear list-members,
Can anybody point us to a passage about a gov?lavyajana (a cow-hair-fan of one da??a or more in length) 
used in some way on the occasion of bathing on the fourth day after menstruation ?
Does she (the udaky?) stand beneath (arv?k) the gov?lavyajana?  Or should she bathe before or after (arv?k) using it in some way?
We (Dr. Sathyanarayanan and myself) are trying to interpret the following passage in our forthcoming edition of Trilocana?iva's Pr?ya?cittasamuccaya (C12th):
yatra bh?mau t??a? n?sti jala? vodakyay? saha|
gov?lavyajan?d arv?k sn?na? tatra vidh?yate|| 524*||
gov?lavyajana? da??o yadv? pauru?am?nata?|
t??ak???hanikh?te?u ku?yen?ntarhitena v?|| 525*||
gov?lavyajane c?pi sn?na? tatra na vidyate| (OR: tatra vidh?yate)
karmamadhye tu t?? d???v? g?hastha? pra?ava? japet|| 526*||
We would be grateful for any help.
