Sanskrit tatoo fail
Colleagues - I thought this might amuse you.
My sharp-eyed daughter spotted this tatoo and asked me what is meant:

I looked at? anugacchatu prav?ha, and came up with the nonsensical 'let he/she/it follow' + 'O current'
On being informed, my daughter, with Gen-Y insight, immediately said, 'O right - she probably meant "Go with the flow".'
Such are the dangers of D-I-Y Sanskrit translations.
