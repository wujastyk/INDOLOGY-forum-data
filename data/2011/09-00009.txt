Subject: Sanskrit tatoo fail
Message-ID: <161227093732.23782.12804257039902983854.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Colleagues - I thought this might amuse you.

My sharp-eyed daughter spotted this tatoo and asked me what is meant:

I looked at? anugacchatu prav?ha, and came up with the nonsensical 'let he/she/it follow' + 'O current'

On being informed, my daughter, with Gen-Y insight, immediately said, 'O right - she probably meant "Go with the flow".'

Such are the dangers of D-I-Y Sanskrit translations.
