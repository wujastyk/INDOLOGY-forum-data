Maybe some unemployed Ph.D.'s could publish an authoritative book of patterns with translations and explanations, and/or set up a site whence once could order transparencies to be used as temporary tattoos or guides for high-quality permanent tattoos.  Might be less hassle and more money than being adjust assistant professor at three colleges a hundred miles apart.

Subject: [INDOLOGY] What's the difference between Arabic and Sanskrit

I came across this post in a Yahoo site just now.  It made me gasp aloud.

Jennifer asks,
What is the difference between sanskrit and Arabic?

I wanted to get a tattoo in Arabic because I have an egyptian fascination and want a consistent flow of relativity on my body seeing as how I already have an ankh. A friend of mine told me I should get sanskrit because it is more closely related to egypt. And I think Arabic is prettier.

In fact, Jennifer has received five informative answers, setting her straight, one even explaining Panini and the Astadhyayi.  The correspondent "Z" makes an unassailable truth claim by asserting "I am arabic."

The conclusion we must draw is that tatoo parlours badly need more Indologists.  And Arabists, and Egyptologists.
