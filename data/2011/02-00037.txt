What is the writing on the attached image?
A very strange choice of text for this stamp!
By the way,  I have a small collection of Indian stamps with Sanskrit texts 
or Sanskrit-literature related themes (e.g., Gilgit manuscripts). There are 
quite a few. I could provide a list if anyone is interested.
