Dear James,

I would add the distinction between "born from an uterus" (yoni-ja or  
jar?yuja), "born from an egg" (a??aja), "born from sweat/ 
warmth" (svedaja) and born from water (udbhijja). The latter group  
includes all sorts of plants. The four groups seem to include all  
living beings in common understanding, but some philosophical schools  
(I am thinking now of Pr?bh?k?ra M?m??s? texts specifically)  
oppose the view that also the latter ones are living beings and claim  
that they are just like stones (crystal may also grow, but are  
nonetheless non-living).

yours elisa freschi
