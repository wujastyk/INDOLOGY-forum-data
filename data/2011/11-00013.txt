Dear Anthony,
My limited understanding of Indian copyright law is that copyright expires
either sixty years after the death of the author or sixty years after the
publication of a work if it is published posthumously or if it is a
photograph.
So it would seem to be fine to re-use by either reckoning.
Best,
Venetia
