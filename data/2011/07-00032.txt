Friends,
Among the maahaatmya-s listed by Mr. Taylor, I was told that the Kaa"siikha.n.da is being recited (at least in the month of kaarttika) in Varanasi; the Brahmottarakha.n.da is a very important religious text highly venerated by the saiva-s of Tamilnadu. It has been rendered into tamil verse by one of the descendants of later Pandya kings in the 16th century and has been published.
I think the Brahmottarakha.n.da does not so much deal with the greatness of Varanasi. Some of the religious and even philosophical doctrines of Saivasiddhanta are discussed in that. It is the Kaa'siikha.n.da that excusively deals with Varanasi. There is a valuable commentary also for this which has been published.
The Setumaahaatmya also has been Translated into Tamil verse under the name Cettuppuraa.nam.
Long back I heard that the Venkatachalamaahaatmya used to be recited or expounded during Navaraatri celebrations in some parts of Karnataka, especially by vaishnava-s.
Kaarttikamaahaatmya is being regularly recited during that month in Varanasi and I have even heard it being recited (interspersed with Hindi explanations) some years back in a Siva temple in Amritsar.
With the best wishes,
Ganesan

  Subject: [INDOLOGY] Contemporary recitation of Skandapur?? a m?h?tmya?


  Dear colleagues

  I am interested in the contemporary uses of puranic texts, in particulary the Skandapur??a. Below is a list of the main m?h?tmya of the Skanda.

  Do any of you good folk know if any of these texts are still recited or at least drawn on or employed in ritual in their relevant situations?

  Thanks in advance

  McComas
