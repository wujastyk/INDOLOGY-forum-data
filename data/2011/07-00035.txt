Bhattacharya article
Dear Friends and Colleagues,
I urgently seek the article of Gouriswar Bhattacharya: 'Nandin and Vrsabha', Zeitschrift der deutschen morgenl?ndischen Gesellschaft Suppl. 3, 1977, pp. 1545-67. I am unable to come to Leiden these days where it might (or not) be available. So if someone has an e-version, I would be grateful for sending it off-list.
Thanks!!!
Anna Slaczka,
Amsterdam.
