What is the writing on the attached image?
Hi Dominik,
"What is that sun doing in the top right corner?"  The sun makes perfect sense, as Pata?jali describes P??ini as pr??mukha? upavi?ya s?tr??i pra?ayati sma.  However, in Pata?jali's description of P??ini composing his s?tras with great effort (mahat? yatnena), he is sitting facing the east, with the sacred darbha grass in his hand (darbha-pavitra-p??i), and not a pen to write down his rules.  So, the artist has tried to save P??ini from the charge of illiteracy!

Indeed !
The diagram in the background, behind the writing Panini, has the general
look as a jyoti?a j?taka or horoscope chart, but with the Br?hm? numerals in
the 12 positions, instead of the zodiac.  And what's that sun doing in the
top right corner?
