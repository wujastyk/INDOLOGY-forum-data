According to K. V. Subrahmanya Aiyar (Travancore Archaeological Series vol. 4, p.109), in the Sanskrit work B?lar?ma Bh?ratam, the author B?lar?mavarman Kula?ekhara-Perum?? uses the word 'tantuv?ya' in the sense of 'tailor'. (See attachment). Has the word 'tantuv?ya' been used in the meaning of 'tailor' anywhere else in Sanskrit? 
A related question is: what is the etymology of Skt. tunnav?ya?
Thanks in advance.
