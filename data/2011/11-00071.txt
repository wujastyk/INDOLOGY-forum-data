MAX MUELLER- BOOKS ON INDIA
To All Members and Scholars in Indology,
May I kindly be informed of the list of books written by Max Mueller, the
German philosopher , on ancient Indian heritage and culture.
You will find an overview in Jacques Waardenburg: Classical approaches to
the study of religion : aims, methods and theories of research. Vol. 2:
Bibliography. The Hague, Paris : Mouton, 1974, pp. 184 seqq. (compare URL:
<http://books.google.com/books?id=Ya9b6dOEPT4C

age> &lpg=PP1&hl=de&pg=PA184#v=onepage>)
Waardenburg refers to two older bibliographies: one by Winternitz (1893) and
another one by Michael Johan de Goeje, in an obituary published in 1902. 
If you do not already know it: Nirad C. Chaudhuri: Scholar extraordinary :
the life of Professor the Rt. Hon. Friedrich Max M?ller, P. C. / by Nirad C.
Chaudhuri. - London : Chatto & Windus, 1974 (an Indian edition came out in
1974 by Orient Paperbacks, reprinted in 1996) contains a small bibliography
on p. 385 seq.
Hope it helps
