Subject: suppliers of India game boards?
Message-ID: <161227091328.23782.14855691466119393210.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I have been asked by an employee of a game shop for information on traditional Indian board games, and I am supplying them with book titles and suggestions how to order them.  Does anyone know of any firms manufacturing the boards and pieces?

Thanks,

Allen
