=================

I see a probable spelling error or two in the record which I will get corrected.

WorldCat shows a single copy of a second ed. of the first book, published Dilli, Pablikesansa Divizana, 1957, in a single volume. This is in Chicago.

However, it is possible what is offered is a Hindi translation of Smith, which someone has identified as Sanskrit from the Nagari script.  I cannot locate online a Hindi or Sanskrit translation of Smith, but Western libraries would not buy such a work and Indian libraries are not on OCLC/WorldCat yet, for the most part.

WWW.used.addall.com shows this title with a reference to Amazon.com, but with the additional information that it was from  Munshiram Manoharlal, being published in 1992.  Perhaps you could ask Munshiram < http://www.mrmlonline.com > if that is indeed what it was.
