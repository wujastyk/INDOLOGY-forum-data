prices of Khotan or Newari mss
There's a fairly constant stream of Skt MSS being sold through ebay.com.
They're often very cheap (though sometimes just a few folios), except when
illustrated.  See
here<http://shop.ebay.com/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p5197.m570.l1313&_nkw=sanskrit+manuscript&_sacat=See-All-Categories>.
Caveat emptor, of course.
