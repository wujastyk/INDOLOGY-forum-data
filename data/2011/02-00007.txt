Dear list,

We are pleased to announce the 3rd Prakrit Summer School (July 26 - August
6, 2011) in Ghent, Belgium. A similar introductory course in
Jaina-Maharastri took place in Finland in 2007 and in W?rzburg in 2009. The
PSS is also this time going to focus on the Jain epic and narrative
material.

For details see:

Please inform any students who may be interested in participating.


With best wishes,
Eva De Clercq (evadeclercq at gmail.com)
