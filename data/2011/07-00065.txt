new etexts at SARIT
I'm pleased to announce some additions to the SARIT repository of Indic
e-text editions.
The new editions are of:
   - Carakasa?hit?
   - A????gasa?graha
   - Ratnak?rtinibandh?vali
A full list of available texts is given here <http://tinyurl.com/bpprco> (or
just go to http://sarit.indology.info and press "search" without entering
anything).
As with all the texts in SARIT, the above works can be searched with
strategies from simple word-searches to complex multi-criterion searches.
KWIC indexes can be generated automatically.  And all works can be
downloaded or read online in HTML, PDF or XML (TEI) format.
All texts have also been installed in a Github repository as previously
announced.  This is an experimental service for intelligently managing
updates and changes to these e-texts as they evolve in time through
enrichment and correction.
With many thanks to Patrick Mc Allister for technical support,
Best,
Dominik Wujastyk
