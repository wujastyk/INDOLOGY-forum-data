Persian and Arabic borrowings in Sanskrit
Dear colleague,
one the earliest instances (11th century) of a Sanskrit text incorporating several Perso-Arabic loanwords in a Sanskritized form is the Buddhist K?lacakra Tantra. 
John Newman's article Islam in the K?lacakra Tantra, "Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies", vol. 21, no. 2, 1998: 311-371 gives several examples and even has a list (p. 333) of such words.
Best,
