Please pardon x-posting.

I wanted to draw your attention to SMU's annual S. Asia conference (in conjunction with a local non-profit, the South Asia Research and Information Institute).  On Sept. 24th, 2011, we will host an all-day conference entitled "Alternative Ramayanas" at SMU in Dallas.  Registration (which is free) will be announced at the end of the summer, but should you be considering attending and in need of information, please feel free to contact me off-list.  For a list of previous conference topics, please see www.sarii.org

Presenters at this year's conference are: Philip Lutgendorf, Paula Richman, V. Narayana Rao, Phyllis Granoff, and Marshall Clark.

My best,

s
