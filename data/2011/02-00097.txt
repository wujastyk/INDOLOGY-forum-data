Fwd: Re: [INDOLOGY] default reply behaviour (was: curses)
It seems to me that the point of this list is that it creates a venue for a 
highly accessible community forum.  That an occasional "private" message 
creeps in does not seem to me to be an adequate reason for abrogating what 
stands at the center of the whole thing--namely, the ability to seamlessly 
"reply to the list."
In these days of "cut and paste," we should all be aware that what goes into 
any electronic communication is really not "private;" the old "for your eyes 
only" style message is probably best left for other methods of 
communication.
