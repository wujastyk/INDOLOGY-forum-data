Tibeten~Sanskrit Idiom Query
Dear Stephen and colleagues,
Lokesh Chandra's Tibetan-Sanskrit Dictionary, Supplementary Volume, p. 683a
lists avidheya as an equivalent attested from the A????gah?daya 1.1.34,
although this may be of very limited application in the Vinaya context.
As Dorji Wangchuk just mentioned, this is a form that suggests an injunctive
force, and it may be worthy of noting that mi btub appears to be equivalent
to abhavya in the Mah?vyutpatti 9135 : abhavyo haritv?ya : sngon por 'gyur
du mi rung ba 'am mi btub.
