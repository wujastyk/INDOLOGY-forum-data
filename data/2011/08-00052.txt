Asoka and medicinal service
Dear Colleague,
The king states that he has arranged. That is sufficient. Otherwise you 
may go on doubting. That is free. One may doubt even if it was the deed 
of Asoka and not of a different king named Priyadarsi

It is certain that medical service was available from state to humans and animals.?
Dear Dipak,?
In what way is it certain? What is meant by "from state"? What do you mean by "animals"?
Yes, Artha?astra and A?oka's Edicts, as evidence. But - do we have tools with which to find out exactly what in these texts belongs to the sphere of postulates and what represents the sphere of practices?
Any iconographic evidence?
