The version of Apple Mail I use, right at this moment, is 4.5 (1084). The number in parentheses is an internal built number or something like that, I guess. 

One may try to switch the display format: e.g. highlight the message, then hit Alt-Cmd-U. After that the display should change. If not, you have to twiddle with the preferences. 

Hope it helps
