The City in Sanskrit literature
McComas and Andrew,
Not a text, but an interesting reading would be A. K. Ramanujan, "Towards 
an Anthology of City Images" pp. 224-242 in Richard G. Fox, editor, _Urban 
India: Society, Space and Image_ (Durham, N.C. Duke University Program in 
Comparative Studies on Southern Asia, 1970) [Monograph and Occasional 
Papers Series, Monograph 2]--which contrasts treatment of cities in 
Sanskrit literature with that of Tamil literature.
