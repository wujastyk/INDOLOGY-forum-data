Dear Friends,
That is encouraging but, I do not know why, the version?I
downloaded runs up to v?todh?v?t
?GpBr_1,3.6. 
I do not know if there is any incompatibility on any side
that has prevented a complete downloading. There is a Bengali transl. by T. N. Adhikari,
but that does not serve my purpose. I expect to get a copy of H. C. Patyal?s
translation. There is also a possibility of the R. L. Mitra edition being
reprinted. That will remove the difficulties. Even then a complete text on the
internet will be useful. I am checking again with Gretil.

Re: [INDOLOGY] [INDOL OGY] accen ted ?B fil es in Unic ode?
The file I have submitted to GRETIL for the Gopathabr?hma?a (based on the edition by D. Gaastra, with some corrections from various sources) should, barring any oversights on my side, be complete.
Best wishes,

Re: [INDOLOGY] accented ?B files in Unicode?
The same holds good for the Gopatha-Br?hma?a and the two
V?jasaneya-Sa?hit?s. A M?dhyandina-Samhit? with Hindi commentary is available
but more valuable will be the text with Uva?a and Mah?dhara. The Gopatha-Br?hma?a
has been kindly made available by Gretil but it is incomplete. I have only a
J?v?nanda Vidy?s?gara edition which is not very dependable and is already 12
decades old. The two critical editions are out of print. 
The K??va ?.B. is available in print with S?ya?a?s
commentary but not with Gretil.

[INDOLOGY] accented ?B files in Unicode?
In a similar vein, does anyone know if there is a downloadable transliterated unicode version of the ?atapatha Br?hma?a (accented, in either recension)?? I am aware of GRETIL's version of M (no accents), JR Gardner's vedavid.org version, and the TITUS accented version of M (which is what I often use, but it is not downloadable as far as I can tell; K is listed as in preparation).
I hadn't searched for this in a long time, but in doing so now I was pleased to find that archive.org has a full scan of Eggeling's
 translation.
Best,
Steven
