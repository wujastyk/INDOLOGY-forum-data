'adolescence' in traditional India
This has some relevant material:
Deshpande, Kamalabai
The child in ancient India
S.N.D.T. Women's College, Poona, 1936
It's a dissertation from Prague directed by Winternitz.  BTW I've been told the author was one of the first women from India to have gotten a Ph.D. in Europe.
