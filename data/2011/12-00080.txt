To whom it may concern (and please excuse, if it was already done).


Announcing the ?De Nobili Research Library Prize? for 2012

The association ?De Nobili Research Library ? Association for Indology and the Study of Religion?, Vienna, aims to promote research on Indian religions, especially from the point of view of the mutual encounter between Christian spirituality as well as Christianity and Western thought in general, and the various manifestations of Indian religiosity.
To further this aim, the Association disseminates the results of such research through the organisation of symposia and public lectures, and especially through its two publication series (see http://www.istb.univie.ac.at/cgi-bin/sdn/sdn.cgi).
This year, the Association decided to promote its aims in still another way. It herewith announces, for the first time, an essay competition. Stu?dents, young researchers and others interested in the Christian encounter with Indian religions are cordially invited to submit an essay on the topic ?Dimensions of the Christian Encounter with the Religions of India: Aims, Possibilities, Ramifications?. The previously unpublished essays may be written in English or German, and should amount to approximately 18,000 words. A prize committee consisting of members of the Association and an external referee will evaluate the submitted essays in a double-blind review process. The best essay will be awarded with the ?De Nobili Research Library Prize? for 2012; the prize money amounts to ? 2,500. The prize may be shared by two winners.
Essays should be formatted in 12 pt, with 1.5 line spacing, and submitted in PDF-format until May 20, 2012, the 407th anniversary of Roberto de Nobili?s arrival in India, to the Deputy Secretary of the Association, Dr. Marcus Schm?cker, at Marcus.Schmuecker at oeaw.ac.at.

With best regards,
Karin Preisendanz, Chairperson of the Association
