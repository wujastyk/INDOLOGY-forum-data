Vidvadrudhi and Mahayoga
r??hi is, of course, the conventional meaning of a word, such as Br?ha?a being a group of people or caste. yoga is viewed as the etymological meaning: such as, brahmavid br?hma?a?. What the first terms of the compounds are, I am not sure. vidvadr??hi could mean conventional meaning among the learned.
