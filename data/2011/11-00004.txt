r??hi is, of course, the conventional meaning of a word, such as Br?ha?a being a group of people or caste. yoga is viewed as the etymological meaning: such as, brahmavid br?hma?a?. What the first terms of the compounds are, I am not sure. vidvadr??hi could mean conventional meaning among the learned.

While commenting on VT's ma;ngala;sloka, Raamaacaarya uses two technical terms which I haven't been able to find a good interpretation for. They are "vidvadruu.dhi" and "mahaayoga". I assume that these are technical terms of grammar, but I am not should what the precise distinction is between them. I would be grateful if anyone could clarify.
