Tamil Text Book?
Dear Prof Tieken,
Thanks so much. 
Let me clarify; I am looking for an introductory modern spoken Tamil text for American undergraduates. A textbook that would cover an introduction to script, basic grammar, drills, etc. Something on a par with Usha Jain's Introduction to Hindi Grammar.
Warm Thanks from Chilly Delhi,
Mary
