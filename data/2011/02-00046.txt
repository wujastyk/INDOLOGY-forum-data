Hi Bob,
George Nicholls' /Sketch of the Rise**and Progress of the Benares 
Patshalla or Sanskrit College, now forming the Sanskrit Department of 
the Benares College/ (1907) lists Gosain Anand Gir as professor of 
pur??as in the first list of professors at the college, i.e. late 1790s 
- early 1800s (p. 4).  I cannot make out enough of the name of the 
translation's author to see if the two names can be reconciled.
