Dear colleagues,

I would like to remind you about the continuation of the well-known tradition of the Heidelberg Summer Schools in 2011.
As a new feature, this year's summer school will also include courses in Colloquial Tibetan and Manuscriptology.

All courses take place at the South Asia Institute, University of Heidelberg, from August 01 - 26:

- Spoken Sanskrit (by Sadananda Das)
- Nepali Intensive (by Laxmi Nath Shrestha)
- Colloquial Tibetan (by Jonathan Samuels)
- Manuscriptology (by Saraju Rath)

The deadline for application is 31st Mai 2011. For further information and download of the application form, see:

The Summer Schools are organised jointly by Professor Birgit Kellner, Cluster of Excellence "Asia and Europe in a Global Context", and Professor Axel Michaels, Department of Cultural and Religious History of South Asia (Classical Indology), South Asia Institute, University of Heidelberg.

Best wishes,

Markus Viehbeck
