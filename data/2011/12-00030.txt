Annapurna
Dear Artur,
I think we need to step back from specific peaks of the Annapurna range and
look at the geography as a whole.  The toponym, Annapurna, denotes a
goddess of abundance who is often manifest as a overflowing jar (kalash or
purnagata) , e.g., the Annapurna temple in Kathmandu.
Since the Annapurna range as a whole feeds the Kali-Gandak river (with an
abundant flow of water) it is more likely that early nomenclature did not
indicate specific  peaks  but simply the the massive overflowing abundance
of the general area as the source of the river.  The jar as goddess
phenomenon is known inearly scypture and is associated not only with
Annapurna, but also Naya Guhyeshvari,  Puran Guhyesgvari and (according to
the invocational inscription on the Annapurna temple) Yogambara/Jnanesvari
at Mhepi-ajima.
Thus, it is my opinion the enumerations are a British "map-maker's"
Nomenclature and not in any way traditional.
I hope this is useful,
John
