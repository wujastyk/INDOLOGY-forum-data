Query from Hal Schiffman
In Kannada, I have never heard or seen anything other than Mu?bai / Mu?bayi. There is also a persistant belief that Mu?b?d?vi is a Kannada-speaking goddess; I have not read this anywhere, nor do I know anything about the origin of this belief, but in conversations with numerous persons throughout Karnataka I have heard this repeatedly.
