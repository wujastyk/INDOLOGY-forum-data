Porunthal: dating of paddy in the 5th century B.C. and              possible consequences on the evaluation of the history of writing              in India
Dear Corinna,
are you perhaps referring to the kind of "signs"
which are discussed by K.Rajan in a 2001 article
(in a volume edited by ye.cupparAyalu and Ce. irAvu)
The title of the article is
"paNTai kuRiyITukaLum eZuttukkaLum"
(ancient signs/symbols and letters)
I attach it as a scanned PDF
(it seems to fall within fair use,
because the volume is difficult to find)
Since, obviously,
K.Rajan knows the difference
between symbols and letters,
I wonder why he decided in this case (in Porunthal)
that we have "letters" and not "symbols" (or potters' marks).
Best wishes
