thank you
I am deeply grateful to Isabelle Ratie, Andrey Klebanov,
and Harunaga Isaacson, who all responded
to my request for the articles
by May and Schmithausen almost instantaneously. There is
no need for further assistance with this particular
search, but thanks, too, to all those who may have
been thinking to respond as well.
