Copying of Sanskrit texts into Sinhala lipi
Dear list
I am trying to establish whether a particular palm leaf manuscript might
reflect the copying of Sanskrit texts into Sinhala lipi. I would be most
interested in any information you might know of on this subject. Even
information on the similar trend of copying Sanskrit texts into Tamil
lipi, using the modified form of Grantha, could prove helpful.
