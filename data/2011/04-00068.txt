Subject: Assistance requested in obtaining copies of two doctoral theses              on Sanskrit grammar
Message-ID: <161227092297.23782.17779464810579368936.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear members of the list,

I am having trouble trying to obtain copies of the following two doctoral
theses:

Mi?ra, Adya Prasada (1966). *Prakriy?kaumud?-vimar?a?* (=Sarasvat? Bhavana
Studies 15). Varanasi: V?r??aseya Sa?sk?ta Vi?vavidy?laya. [A V?r??aseya
Sa?sk?ta Vi?vavidy?laya doctoral dissertation from 1964].

Saini, R. S. (1965). *Post-P??inian systems of Sanskrit grammar, with
special reference to their technique and scope*. Delhi. [Unpublished].

Would any of you know from where I might be able to obtain copies of these
or, perhaps, have a reference to someone who might know?

Many thanks in advance.

Best regards,
Jesper Larn?s
