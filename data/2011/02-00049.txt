Dear colleague,
Anandaghan "Khwush" was  a poet who hailed from "among the intellectuals of Brindaban" (quoted by Rajeev Kinra, Infantilizing Baba Dara, "Journal of Persianate Studies" 2 (2009), p. 174).
He was the author of several Persian works, many of which are mentioned in Hermann Eth?'s Catalogue of Persian Manuscripts in the Library of the India Office, London 1903-37 (nos. 1725, 1959, 1962,  2905, 2906, 2926). These (possibly) include Persian translations of the Gayamahatmya, Bhagavadgita, Kashikhanda and Ramayana.
Best,
