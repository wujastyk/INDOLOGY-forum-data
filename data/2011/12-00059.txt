Macintosh Devanagari font
Dear Lars,
I'm posting to the list as this may apply to others.  A person may not need a new keyboard file for certain fonts when transitioning from OS9 to OSX.  OSX changed to using 'resource' (.rsrc) files for keyboard layouts.  The solution (at least one we came up with that allowed Manjushree by Madhav to work in OSX) is simply to remove any file type from the current keyboard name (.layout or whatever it is; I don't remember now) and replace it with .rsrc and then reinstall.
This may or may not work here, but since it works in one case, it is worth a try.
Best,
Steven

[INDOLOGY] Macintosh Devanagari font
Dear members of the list,
A person who is not a member of the listasked me to pass on the the following request to you.
?Ecological Linguistics appears to be out of business. They are not answering their email, nor answering their phone, nor answering their snail mail. I was a user of their Macintosh Devanagari font for Systems 9 and earlier, which doesn't work on OS X. Theyupgraded that font for OS X, but are no longer around to fill orders. Wouldsomeone be kind enough to send that updated font to sfauthor at aol.com<mailto:sfauthor at aol.com>? In fact, I may only need the keyboard file, since I updated all of my OS 9 fonts with a program called FontXChange. Huge thanks in advance! ?
Best regards
