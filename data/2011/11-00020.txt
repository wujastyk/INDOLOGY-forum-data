Hi Dominik,
I had a discussion recently with an ex copyright lawyer here in Bangalore
and based on that and reading a little about it on the internet (for
instance the Wikipedia article on Indian copyright law here:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_law_of_India) that would be my guess
but it would be best to get a proper legal opinion on this.
Incidentally, I asked whether textual/critical editions are copyrighted and
in that connection my contact here noted that a recent change in Indian
copyright law in 2007 means that creativity and originality are given more
weightage than they used to be - it used to be based more on 'sweat of the
brow'.
Best,
Venetia
