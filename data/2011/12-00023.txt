Dear List,

Annapurna Mt. has four peaks - Annapurna I, II, III, and IV. What are
their formal Nepalese names?

Would it be (in Nepalese) Annapurna One, Two, Three, Four, or, rather,
Annapurna First, Second, Third, Fourth?

Nepalese colloquial or Sanskritic numerals?

Great thanks in advance,

Artur Karp
