tapas here ought to be understood as 'pain', 'suffering' -- e.g., from mundane labor, just as you suggest -- without the notion of ascetic discipline

The following is interesting.

"10. For the priesthood he seizes a Br?hmana, for the Br?hmana is the priesthood: he thus joins priesthood to priesthood 2<http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/sbr/sbe44/sbe44111.htm#fn_1064>;--for the nobility he seizes a R?ganya, for the R?ganya is the nobility: he thus joins nobility to nobility;--for the Maruts (he seizes) a Vaisya, for the Maruts are the clans (peasants): he thus joins peasantry to peasantry;--
p. 410
for (religious) toil (he seizes) a S?dra, for the S?dra is toil: he thus joins toil to toil;"

...
"THE (SYMBOLICAL) VICTIMS OF THE PURUSHAMEDHA 1<http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/sbr/sbe44/sbe44111.htm#fn_1072>.
I. 1. To the priesthood (he consecrates) a Br?hmana--2. To the nobility a Kshatriya--3. To the Maruts a Vaisya--4. To penance (hardship, tapas) a Sidra--"

Why is ??dra equated to (religious) toil/penance/tapas  - not just mundane labor? How does this relate to the ban on ??dra performing Tapas as in the case of ?ambuka in R?m?ya?a?

Thanks in advance.

There is, but it is rather elaborate.

See Satapatha Brahmana 13.6

Is there no hierarchy within the category of humans for the Vedic sacrifice?  That is, if you're going to sacrifice a human, will any human do?

Dear List

Maybe nobody noticed my mistake, or maybe many of you did, but you decided to forgive me.  In any case, the Vedic hierarchy of sacrificial victims is not:

5. sheep
4. goat
3. cattle
2. horse
1. human

It is instead:

5. goat
4. sheep
3. cattle
2. horse
1. human

I make this mistake all the time.  It is clear that in my urban world the value of the goat and the sheep is negligible.  But this is not true of the Vedic clans.

Best,
George
