Hi Ryan,

A cursory google search reveals a similar phrase in the Bh?gavata Pur??a at 2.5.3: kar?malakavadvi?vam, or something like 'everything is just like an ?malaka fruit in hand.'  So, at least the this fruit appears to be a known object of comparison.  I can't speak for the translucent qualities of this particular fruit however.  Skyu ru ra seems to mean 'something that is perfectly clear in front of the eyes,' whether perfectly clear refers to vegetal translucence or visibility is a matter of some opaqueness it would seem...

    Dear all,

    

    I recently came across a reference to the ?malaki fruit in the
    Buddhist Mah?m?y?tantra and in its commentary, the Gu?avat?
    by Ratn?kara??nti.  The citations are as follows:

    

    First from the root tantra, in Tibetan (there is no extant Sanskrit
    manuscript):  lag tu skyu ru ra bzhag bzhin.

    

    Which Ratn?kara??nti glosses with: svahaste sthitamekam?malakam
      yathetyartha?

    

    I initially took this to mean simply that the referent was as clear
    to the subject as a fruit placed in one's own hand.  However, two
    Tibetan colleagues both asserted that the ?malak? fruit, as
    understood in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition at least, is a
    translucent fruit which reveals its inner structure to the subject
    (not my personal experience with the contemporary version of Amalaki
    fruit).  Thus for a situation to be "like an ?malak? fruit
    in one's own hand" means one is able to see the referent inside and
    out, that is, in totality.  My question then is this:  is this
    analogy common in Indic traditions and, more importantly, are there
    any known references to these properties of the ?malak? in
    Sanskrit works?

    

    Much thanks,

    

    Ryan
