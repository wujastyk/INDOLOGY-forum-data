No incoming Sanskrit students at Andhra University :-(
Re: Prof Bhattacharya and Prof Tull's comparative interest in Latin: the
akme within the Humanities was perhaps in mid-1930s, when a lot of leading
'Classical' philologist and linguists enthusiastically proposed every
scholarly periodical - including 'Oriental' - to be written in Latin... (a
Latin dissertatio in things Sanskrit/Indian survived in parts of Europe
around 1900, e.g. Pischel's, in 1875, and then his pupils). Of course, in a
couple of years the goals were a bit different. There are some mentions of
this international project in *L'Ann?e philologique *of Marouzeau (and
Lambrino, a Romanian scholar, exponent of an European interwar tradition
which supported the teaching of Latin in highschools - one to three years -
up to the end of the Communist regime in 1989, at least in this Latin coin
of Eastern Europe, but in its aftermath the situation was and is equally
disastrous).
In his *La ricerca della lingua perfetta nella cultura europea*, Umberto Eco
still tries to support the fabric of posthumous Latin neologisms (as
'videocapsulae' and, with a stronger impact? 'publicitarii'), which would be
interesting to compare with the revival of (spoken) Sanskrit after 1947.
Greek and Latin production of neologism still functions, more or
less authomatically as far as I am aware, in medical and pharmaceutical
research. Perhaps Dominik Wujastyk and others may document a similar case as
for the Sanskrit medical sam.hitaas' lexical influence on a variety of
modern Indian languages.
