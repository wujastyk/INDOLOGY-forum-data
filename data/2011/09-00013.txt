Sanskrit tatoo fail
There's already an Indian proverb for "go with the flow."  A Malayali friend used it yesterday.  They translated, "If your cows go where you don't want them to, just keep hitting them and go where they go anyway."  I don't know the Malayalam -- people speak the language too fast to catch the words, though I did hear a?iccu.  In any event, if anyone wants to use this (as a tattoo or slogan), I'll ask and get back with the original.  George Hart
