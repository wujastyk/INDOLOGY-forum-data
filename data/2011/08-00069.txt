" Obliquely, the Ist Rock Edict: "Formerly in the kitchen of king Devanampriya Priyadar?in many hundred thousands of animals (bah?ni

pr??asatasah?srani) were killed daily for the sake of curry"

[Hultzsch, 1925, p. 2]."



Sounds to me that one ought to apply the rule David Henige gives for premodern figures above ten thousand in his Numbers from Nowhere: The American Indian Contact Population Debate: just as a beginning, knock off the last digit.  Henige deals with evidence from a lot of other places besides the Americas, though as best I recall not South Asia.
