Porunthal: dating of paddy in the 5th century B.C. and              possible consequences on the evaluation of the history of writing              in India
Respected Colleagues,
I had apologized beforehand ("sorry to say...") and will do this once more. This was a general statement not immediately connected with the decipherment of "va-y(a)-ra", but drawn from my own - quite recent - experience, when a well-known archaeologist (not to name here) had even given my name in support of an - in my view - untenable new dating attempt. (In this case, Brahmi was not involved.)
But please excuse me, I should better not have conflated these matters!
Best wishes,
Corinna

More than that ... Dear JLC,?
The statement, "Archaeologists, particularly in Tamilnadu, seem to be under a constant kind of pressure (or is it a mindset?) to "push back" so far established dates. They regularly come up with various attempts." needs some attention and substantiation. I wish genuine and serious scholars would stop making such flippant remarks! :-)
Best wishes,

 with confidence that Raja Raja Chola's va is not like the inital diamond. I have no idea about RRC's ba of which I have no specimen. The basic problem may be attempted from this meagre evidence, I think.
