yoga discussion
Hello,
At least in Patanjali's Yogasutra the term yoga is used in the sense  
of eightfold yoga
the limbs being yama, niyama, asana, pranayama, pratyahara, dharana,  
dhyana and samadhi.
In modern times the term yoga is used in all languages mainly in the  
sense of asana. So
it is only a matter of specialisation. Why homonym/polynym discussion?
