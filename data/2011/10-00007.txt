RORI 2007 catalogue of Bharatpur collection
Dear colleagues,
Does anyone happen to have easy access to the RORI MS catalogue of their
Bharatpur collection, published in 2007?  I wish to know whether the
Bharatpur collection contains any MSS of the Carakasamhita, and I'm finding
it hard to get that particular catalogue volume.
Best wishes,
Dominik
