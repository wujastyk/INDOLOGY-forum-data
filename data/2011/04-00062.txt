Pandit Hemendra Nath Chakravarty passed away
Obituary : Pandit Hemendra Nath Chakravarty (Varanasi)
It is with a heavy heart that I am announcing the death of Pandit Hemendra Nath Chakravarty (Varanasi), a pandit par excellence and a wonderful human being. He was a student of Gopinath Kaviraj and learnt many ?aiva texts with him besides the Ny?ya??stra. He taught many Indologists and helped many of us learning the texts of Abhinavagupta. He worked for long term projects with Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (Varanasi) and contributed immensely in the series of the Kal?tattvako?a. He kept on teaching many of his students till his last breath. His annotated English translation of the Tantras?ra of Abhinavagupta is still awaited. 
May his soul rest in peace.
