Asian Medicine: Tradition and Innovation: Future Issues,              Contributions Invited
 Asian Medicine, the journal of the International Association for the Study of Traditional Asian Medicine (IASTAM), is a multidisciplinary, peer-reviewed journal published by Brill (ISSN 1573-420X). The journal is aimed at researchers and practitioners of Asian medicine in Asia as well as in Western countries. It makes available in one single publication academic essays that explore the historical, anthropological, sociological and philological dimensions of Asian medicine as well as practice reports from clinicians based in Asia and in Western countries.
