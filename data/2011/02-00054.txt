 Asian Medicine, the journal of the International Association for the Study of Traditional Asian Medicine (IASTAM), is a multidisciplinary, peer-reviewed journal published by Brill (ISSN 1573-420X). The journal is aimed at researchers and practitioners of Asian medicine in Asia as well as in Western countries. It makes available in one single publication academic essays that explore the historical, anthropological, sociological and philological dimensions of Asian medicine as well as practice reports from clinicians based in Asia and in Western countries.

Our next two issues (Vol.5 no 1 and Vol.5 no 2) will be a special issue on Japan and East Asia (edited by Nancy Stalker) and a special issue on Himalayan medicinal plants (edited by Sienna Craig and Denise Glover). Details of back issues may be found at http://www.brill.nl/asme

Contributions to the journal are welcome, both in the form of standard academic articles and of practice reports (see above). They should be sent to either of the editors, Dr Vivienne Lo (v.lo at ucl.ac.uk) or Prof Geoffrey Samuel (SamuelG at cardiff.ac.uk).? A style guide can be downloaded from http://www.brill.nl/AuthorsInstructions/ASME.pdf
