Porunthal: dating of paddy in the 5th century B.C. and              possible consequences on the evaluation of the history of writing              in India
Dear Colleagues,
I am NOT an archeologist, nor an expert on paleography or  
whatever ... . However, the statement, "Archaeologists, particularly  
in Tamilnadu, seem to be under a constant kind of pressure (or is it  
a mindset?) to "push back" so far established dates. They regularly  
come up with various attempts." needs some attention and  
substantiation. I wish genuine and serious scholars would stop making  
such flippant remarks! :-)
Tamils, as being one myself, have to go through a long way to prove  
ourselves to be worthy of something in a heavily non-Tamil oriented  
culture, anywhere in the world! That being the case, it is also worth  
demanding precise statements about our culture, I think.
Thanks and regards,
V.S. Rajam
