There is also a P??car?tra sa?hit? called K??yapasa?hit?, but I didn't see any parallel in it with your -antara phrase.  It is available as an etext here: <http://tantric-studies.org/e-texts/shaiva/GaPaKa.txt>.

Although I do not think there is any connection between the Kasyapottarasa?hita in hand and the medical text called Kasyapasa?hita (if that?s what you refer to), I have checked the latter, and found nothing.  Elsewhere in the Kasyapottara itself, so far as I have read, no similar list appear, and a word search of the corpus of Unicode Skt texts on my computer shows no occurrences of, e.g., of strings beginning saivantar, vai??avantar, sudrantar, and the like.  So it remains rather anomalous.

Will you check if any list of ;Suudras of the Vai.s.nava-, ;Saiva- etc. varieties has already been mentioned? I shall check the Kaa;syapa-Sa.mhitaa itself.  Perhaps, you too can yourself do that. But i will.

The text itself is not really explicit, except to suggest that the Vai.s.navaantara is a lower status.  In this case, the lower status may be implicitly attributable to association with "Saivas (despite having received the sa.mskaaras taught in the Puraa.nas and Paa~ncaraatra "saastras, noted in the preceding stanza): "saivaagamoktasa.mskaarisambandha.m samavaapya ca | svaya.m ced vai.s.navas ti.s.thed vai.s.navaantara iirita.h ||
