=?utf-8?Q?A_query_related_to_=C5=9A_ambuka?=
In Brahmas?tra commentaries, in the section on the ineligibility of ??dras to attain Vedantic knowledge, does any commentator use the story of ?ambuka (who was killed by R?ma) as an example? If not, what could be the reasons? I would appreciate any comments or references.
Thanks in advance.
