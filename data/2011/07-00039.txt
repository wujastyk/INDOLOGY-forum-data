I unfortunately don't have time to deal with this old issue again here  
right now, but quickly:

1. Everyone who studies these symbols first hand knows that seals are  
only one of many types of Indus artifacts that carry symbols. You find  
Indus symbols on lots of things that surely had nothing to do with  
"names" or "ownership."

2. If you look at Ancient Near Easter seals from the third millennium  
BCE, you'll find that only a minority of them have names on them. We  
discuss this and other things you raise in our original 2004 paper  
that first questioned the old assumption that that Indus symbols were  
linguistic.

What Farmer, Sproat, and Witzel 2004 contend is clearly delineated in  
our paper, which discusses questions like these:

Probably one of the silliest claims ever made about the symbols, with  
no evidence whatsoever to back it.

Best,
