Dear Indologists,
Could anyone of you share with me Adhy?yas 17 and 18 of the
 Cidambaram?h?tmya or direct me where to find them? The copy of the 1971 edition I have received through interlending service (the only accessible library copy in Germany) is missing these.
I would be very grateful indeed.
