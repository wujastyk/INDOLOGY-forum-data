Cidambaram=?utf-8?Q?=C4=81h=C4=81tmya_-_missing_Adhy=C4=81yas?=
Dear Indologists,
Could anyone of you share with me Adhy?yas 17 and 18 of the
 Cidambaram?h?tmya or direct me where to find them? The copy of the 1971 edition I have received through interlending service (the only accessible library copy in Germany) is missing these.
I would be very grateful indeed.
