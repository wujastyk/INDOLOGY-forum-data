Re: [INDOLOGY] tantuv?ya as tailor
Dominic is absolutely right. See tunnav?ya also at Artha??stra 4.1.8, which 
clearly means weaver; and tunnav?ya, compared to wahermen/dyers, at 4.1.25.

verse quoted in the footnote uses rather the expression tunnav?ya.
to a ?tailor? (see, e.g., Manusm?ti 2.214 and commentaries), one expects 
tantuv?ya to refer to a weaver (see, e.g., Manusm?ti 8.397 and commentaries).
4, p.109), in the Sanskrit work B?lar?ma Bh?ratam, the author B?lar?mavarman 
Kula?ekhara-Perum?? uses the word 'tantuv?ya' in the sense of 'tailor'. (See 
attachment). Has the word 'tantuv?ya' been used in the meaning of 'tailor' 
anywhere else in Sanskrit?
