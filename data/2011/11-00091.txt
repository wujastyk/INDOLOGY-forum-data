Birch Bark manuscripts
There are quite a few examples of birch bark ms survival over + 1500 yrs.-- the Gilgit mss, bower mss etc. Thanks to them we know of the Sanskrit Vinaya and Asvaghoasha's Saariputra-. 
The above is said without prejudice to the different claims about the Harappan script ms. What is unproved is that it can hail from such an antiquity.
We cannot forget the story of the Sukraniitisaara and of the more recent Vaastusuutropanishad. Whatever their dates, the tall claims about them seem unjustified.
