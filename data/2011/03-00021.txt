AW: [INDOLOGY] Yoga Body, a book by Mark Singleton
A homonym is generally a word with the same spelling (homograph) and the same 
prononciation (homophon), but different meanings. In this sense yoga (Skt.) and 
yoga (Engl.) might be regarded as homonyms. I think it is this what Singleton 
meant. But only if both "yogas" really mean something different, and this 
remains disputed.

BUT: "the English word "yoga" is NOT a homonym of the Sanskrit word *yoga*.
