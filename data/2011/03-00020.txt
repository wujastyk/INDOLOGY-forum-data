Yoga Body, a book by Mark Singleton
Yes, this is exactly what came to my mind too.  There are three appearences
of yuj in the dh?tup??ha, in fact:
   - 4.68, yuja sam?dhau
   - 7.7, yujir yoge
   - 10.264, yuja ... sa?yamane
accounting for yujyate, yunakti, and yojayati respectively, with slightly
different meanings.  In contrast to N?r?ya?aka??ha, cited by Dominic, yoga
commentators like Bhoja derive yoga- (as in the Yogas?tra) from 4.68, thus
undermining, or even opposing, the "yoga means union" view.  Indeed, yoga is
sometimes glossed as "viyoga," i.e., separation (of, e.g., puru?a and
prak?ti).  Clearly, the word is used from before the Mok?adharma onwards in
many related but different senses.  Where semantic drift (as opposed to
historical phonological discreteness) becomes homonymy is of course
debatable.  But the fact that the grammarians distinguish three roots
suggests that the Sanskrit tradition internally sensed the word yoga as
being at least three homonyms.
However, there's a more important point.  I've just looked up the passage
about homonyms that has exercised George Thompson, and I think George has
missed the point that Singleton is making.  See the snippet
here<http://books.google.com/books?ei=0j12TZLbCcbcsgbzlZSOBQ&ct=result&id=OrosAQAAIAAJ&dq=yoga+body+singleton&q=homonym#search_anchor>in
Google Books; and the relevant pages 15 and 16 from Singleton's book
are
attached to this email.  After a passage addressing the issue of partisan
ownerships of the word and idea of yoga, Singleton suggests that it might be
helpful to consider the English word "yoga" as a homonym of the Sanskrit
word *yoga*.  He doesn't quite put it like that, but it's clear enough that
that's what he means.  The point of this suggested strategy is to disconnect
the modern English use of the word from essentializing arguments about the
meaning and history of the Sanskrit word.  Singleton isn't actually arguing
that "yoga" in Sanskrit is a series of homonyms.
