Hi Bob,

W. McLeod's Historical Dictionary of Sikhism, p. 15,
mentions 
ANAND GHAN. An Udasi scholar of the late 18th and early 19th centuries who, living in Banaras, wrote commentaries on the Adi Granth strongly influenced by Brahmanical thought.

Sounds like this might be your man.

Otherwise, a quick google search shows that Anand Ghan
was a pseudonym once used by Lata Mangeshkar...

all best,
Matthew
