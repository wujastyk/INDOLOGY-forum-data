Dear Hans,
Thanks for this, very clear. I have been pondering on this similarity for months! 
More cheers,

Dear Joanna,
Skt. s?pa : Engl. soup must be a chance similarity. The English word either directly, or through reborrowing from French (which got it from some other Germanic dialect), goes back to Germanic sources. Its relatives are said to include Engl. (to) sup and Germ. saufen 'drink (of/like an animal)'. If there were a direct relationship, either English would have to have souf, or the Sanskrit word would have to be s?ba (that's because of the changes accounted for by Grimm's Law, which separate Germanic from the other Indo-European languages).
Cheers,
Hans Henrich

Dear Patrick?
Thanks! Does this word relate to our term ?soup?? I would agree with a suggestion that this covers a broad selection of dishes?sort of like what we find in recipe books today:  i.e., from a simple broth to stews or ragouts, wet or dry. It would be most informative if the p?ka??stra literaturesays more.
Cheers,
Joanna

The term is s?pa -- the expression s?p?tth?ya (Sk. s?p?rth?ya) -- for the sake of s?pa (probably more like stew, broth).

Dear List,
Since I?m dying of curiosity, if I may ask, can someone tell me what is the edict?s term for ?curry??
Anthropologists are also skeptical of such number codes and have published about them-- but sorry, no references come to mind.
Thanks
Joanna

Sounds to me that one ought to apply the rule David Henige gives for premodern figures above ten thousand in his Numbers from Nowhere: The American Indian Contact Population Debate: just as a beginning, knock off the last digit.  Henige deals with evidence from a lot of other places besides the Americas, though as best I recall not South Asia.
