The Perso-Indica Visiting Fellowships are offered at the Institut d?Etudes Iraniennes of the Sorbonne Nouvelle with the support of the research group ?Mondes iranien et indien? (UMR 7528) and the Fondation Colette Caillat of the Institut de France. The positions are open to outstanding senior and promising younger scholars from any country working on a research topic which can constitute an original and important contribution to the Perso-Indica project. Perso-Indica is a long term project, the purpose of which is to set up a comprehensive Critical Survey of Persian Works on Indian Learned Traditions, encompassing the treatises and translations produced between the 13th and the 19th century (for further details see: http://www.perso-indica.net). Perso-Indica is based in Paris (Sorbonne Nouvelle-UMR 7528) and was launched in 2010 with the financial support of the Institut Fran?ais de Recherche en Iran (Tehran) and the Iran Heritage Foundation (London). In addition, from 2011 onwards, it is supported by the research funds of the programme ?CNRS - Higher Education Chairs?, Iranian studies chair at the Sorbonne Nouvelle ? UMR 7528 ?Mondes iranien et indien?.

Each Visiting Fellowship is for a period of 1 month. Two Fellowships are available during the academic year 2011-2012. One fellowship should be held in February or March 2012, starting February 1st or March 1st. The second fellowship should be held between May and June 2012 and allow the fellow to take part to the Perso-Indica Conference, to be held in Paris in early June 2012.
