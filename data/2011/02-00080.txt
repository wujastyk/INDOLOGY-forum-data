Fwd: Re: [INDOLOGY] default reply behaviour (was: curses)
Colleagues:
I agree with Rosane and others--default reply to list offers great 
potential value to list members.  While it is true that occasionally a 
member sends a private message and broadcasts it to the world, I suspect 
it is infrequent enough (and sometimes so "interesting"), that the 
alternative is not really satisfactory.
