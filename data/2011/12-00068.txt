New version of the Digital Corpus of Sanskrit
Dear list,
a new version of the Digital Corpus of Sanskrit has been released at http://
kjc-fs-cluster.kjc.uni-heidelberg.de/dcs/index.php
Additions and features:
* Book 12 of the Mahabharata completed
* Word clouds for a fast overview of central terms in a text; found at the 
query page (http://kjc-fs-cluster.kjc.uni-heidelberg.de/dcs/index.php?
contents=abfrage)
The tagging program with which the corpus has been created will be released 
as freeware in the next days. I will post a message with download details.
Nice Christmas to all!
Best regards,
Oliver Hellwig
