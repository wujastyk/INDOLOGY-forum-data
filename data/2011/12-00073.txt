Dear list members,

following the recent "London lodging"-thread in the forum I wonder if 
someone could recommend a fairly decent accomodation with reasonable 
prices in Delhi.

I heard of two:

YWCA Blue triangle
Ashoka Rd, Connaught Place, Delhi 110001
Ph: (+91-11) 23360133
Email: btfh at ywcaofdelhi.org
www.ywcaofdelhi.org

YWCA International Guest House
10,International Guest House, Parliament Street, Connaught Place, Delhi, 
110001
Ph: (+91-11) 23361561, 23361662
Email: ywcaindigh at vsnl.net
www.ywcaindia.org

Both of them are currently not available.

Thank you very much and happy holidays,

Himal Trikha
Vienna, Austria
