Porunthal: dating of paddy in the 5th century B.C. and              possible consequences on the evaluation of the history of writing              in India
Dear Corinna,
you might be interested in seeing what the newspaper wrote
in june 2009, when the discovery was made.
If you examine what K.Rajan said to the newspapers 2 years ago
(in june 2009),
"http://www.hindu.com/2009/06/28/stories/2009062854701600.htm"
you can see that at the time,
he thought that the grave was dated much later.
You can read in The Hindu
what he wrote
at the time

K. Rajan, Head of the Department of History, Pondicherry University, 
who directed the excavation, about 12 km from Palani in Tamil Nadu, 
called the discovery of Tamil-Brahmi script ?very important? because 
it had been found in a remote village and goes to show that literacy 
had spread to even far-flung villages during the early Christian era. 
On palaeographical grounds, the script could be dated between the 
first century B.C. and the first century A.D., he said.

Regarding the nature of the artefact,
it was written in the same article that:

Opinion is, however, divided on whether the three letters are in 
Tamil-Brahmi or they are graffiti marks. Dr. Rajan quoted Y. 
Subbarayalu, Head of the Department of Indology, the French Institute 
of Pondicherry, and epigraphist S. Rajagopal as saying they were 
graffiti marks. However, V. Vedachalam, retired senior epigraphist, 
Tamil Nadu Archaeology Department, and S. Rajavelu, senior 
epigraphist, Archaeological Survey of India, agreed with Mr. Mahadevan 
that it was Tamil-Brahmi. Dr. Vedachalam said the symbol of the bead 
had been found on every pot found in the cist-burial.

See also some comments on INDOLOGY at that time
See for instance:
"http://listserv.liv.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0906&L=indology&D=1&O=D&F=P&P=11690"
"http://listserv.liv.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0906&L=indology&D=1&O=D&F=P&P=11790"
"http://listserv.liv.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0906&L=indology&D=0&F=P&O=D&P=13101"
One of the things which seems clear is that K.Rajan was taken by 
surprise by the dating (in the 5th century BC).
Cheers
