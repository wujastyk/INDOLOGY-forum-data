Fwd: Re: [INDOLOGY] default reply behaviour (was: curses)
If you use Mac Mail, it's actually about 5 steps, to Reply All and then remove the individual sender's email and move the 'Indology' address from 'cc.' to 'to'. That's not counting the original 2 when you accidentally reply just to the individual and then delete it. When I get emails that are not meant to be public, I stop reading and delete them as soon as I realise. I would hope that we'd all do that.
