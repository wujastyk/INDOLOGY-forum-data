Translations of Rig Veda Suparna Sukta (RV I.164)
The literature is vast.? The shortest list will perhaps include Ludwig and Geldner by consensus, also Oldenberg Noten (inexhaustive); the traditional view finds some place in H.H.Wilson; VS Agrawala has an exclusive study but many of his interpretations are peculiar to him, sometimes influenced by contemporary Indian mystics. Grassmann is not literal. Stray comments by Kunhan Raja and Edgerton are insufficient.

[INDOLOGY] Translations of Rig Veda Suparna Sukta (RV I.164)
A colleague asked me for recommended translations of the? Rig Veda Suparna Sukta (RV I.164).
I've been meaning to get around to working with it myself but, like so many things, I haven't gotten around to it.
Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. 
Best,
Dean
