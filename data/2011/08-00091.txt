The courtesan's house
Dear members of the list!
There is a passage in an Indic drama, I believe, which gives a good
description of the house of a wealthy courtesan (complete with elephant and
all). Do any of you happen to know where this may be? I have lost the
reference, and it is sorely needed.
Best regards,
Lars Martin Fosse
