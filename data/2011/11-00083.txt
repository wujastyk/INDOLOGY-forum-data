Dear Colleagues
A very talented 3rd year Sanskrit student, Andrew Ritchie, has created this wonderful mock Greek drama or 'satyr play' to provide a humorous 'back-story' to K?lid?sa's Abhij??na??kuntalam.
I hope you enjoy it as much as I do. I am sure Andrew would appreciate receiving your feedback:
