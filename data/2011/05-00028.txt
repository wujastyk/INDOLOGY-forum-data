Slightly cheeky enquiry
Dear Colleagues,
This is an Indological enquiry, but perhaps more related to research  
logistics than it should be.
I am planning to spend the first half of next year in Nepal. I will be  
affiliated to the Lumbini International Research Institute, but I will  
be resident in Kathmandu.
Do list members have any contacts that they might share in terms of  
accommodation and schooling in Kathmandu?
I have two children (who will be 8 and 11 at this time) and am  
struggling to establish school contacts in particular.
Please forgive me for such a nakedly self-interested enquiry!
Best Wishes,
