Another bit of black anti-rakshas PR?
Dear Joanna,
A couple of clarifications here.
Since Viradha is vy?dit?sya ("open-mouthed"), I feel entitled to see
here a definitely satirical allusion to the image of the ultimate
Finisher, the Saturn-like Vishnu, described in the Bhagavadgita
(XI,24) as vy?tt?nana ("open-mouthed").
Yes, Pollock has "like Death attacking peple at their fated hour". But
Monier-Williams, SED, p. 278, comments, more old-fashionedly, on k?la:
abhy-adh?vata praj?? k?la iv?ntaka? - "he attacked the people like
Time the destroyer". And this rendering reminds me of the famous
phrase: k?lo 'smi loka-k?aya-k?t "I am Time, the destroyer of the
world" (Bhg. XI,32).
The Viradha episode mixes horror-like images with satire. Viradha,
despite his outward resemblance to Time, the world destroyer, is
ultimately found out to be a foolish monster, his rage - an expression
of empty pretences.
Everything about him is confused - as the sequence 3-4-2 in place of
the expected (and sacred, mentioned already in the ?atapatha-brahmana)
4-3-2?

Artur Karp
PS. My letter in answer to Louis Gonzalez-Reimann remarks (mostly
negative) re has provoked a mechanic reaction: "Delivery to the
following recipient failed permanently:
    reimann at berkeley.edu.". Etc.
