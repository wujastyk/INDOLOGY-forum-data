Sanskrit teachign post in British secondary school
The SES is a cult/NRM, I think with Gurjieffian links. I've no idea why it has that name, but they are quite keen on Sanskrit.

Hello Dominik,
It puzzles me that a School of Economic Science would have been
influenced by such sources.? Is there evidence that these sources had
any interest in economic science?? I'm not very well informed about
them. I'm just curious.
Thanks for passing this on.
George
