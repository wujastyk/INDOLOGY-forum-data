I didn't get a conclusive answer either way, Dominik, or at least not one
that I was able to fully comprehend.
There was apparently a case in 1889 in which a publisher created an edition
of a text in which passages were re-arranged, and footnotes and references
from similar works added.  Someone then re-published the text with the
same editions and footnotes with minor differences. The court found in
favour of the original publisher on the basis that although the text
itself could not be considered copyrighted, the additions and alterations,
and the new arrangement of the text, was. So this is evidently not a new
problem.  I suppose footnotes, endnotes and any other additions - as
opposed to the edition of the text itself - would have a much stronger case
for protection anywhere.
Thank you Birgit for noting how it works in Germany.
