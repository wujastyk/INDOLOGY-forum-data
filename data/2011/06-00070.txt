There are multiple references in Buddhist and Ny?ya literature to the  
power of mantras to cure snake bites, etc. This generally accepted  
?fact? has become the standard example for the visible results of the  
Vedic rituals and is used to infer the general validity of the Veda.  
See for instance V. Eltschinger, Dharmak?rti sur les mantra et la  
perception du supra-sensible. Wien 2001.
