One famous quotation by Terence reads: "*Homo sum, humani nihil a me alienum
puto*", or "I am a man, I consider nothing that is human alien to me." This
appeared in his play *Heauton
Timorumenos<https://mail.google.com/wiki/Heauton_Timorumenos>
*.
My version of Jakobson's paraphrase, which I sent to a list member a little
while ago, is:
"I am a linguist; there is nothing in linguistics that I consider foreign to
me."
Perhaps the List in general might find this of interest.
Best wishes,
George Thompson
