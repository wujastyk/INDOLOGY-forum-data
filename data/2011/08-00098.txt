Fw: [INDOLOGY] Asokan break with the past
21 08 11
This is in continuation of my previous mail. The question of
break with the past is quite a discussed issue. One need not read Asoka?s mind
but see the effect in the centuries after and before Christ, just as one need not
read the mind of Pericles or Zarathustra to see the change in Greece or Persia
after them that had made Rhys Davids to pass his comments on the first effects
of the Iron Age in the ancient world. Since other works will not be available
to the correspondent , R.C. Hazra?s Studies in the Puranic Records of Hindu rites
and customs 207-210 along with the chapters in the CHI ?(I:221) referred to therein? are advised for consultation on the
post-Asokan break in customs and relevant matter.

Intensive study of the inscriptions is the main instrument. That can be misused: V.Smith, for example, saw nothing beyond feeling of unity with animals, a view indirectly reiterated by Keith,? as if Asoka did not feel for man. D. D. Kosambi (junior) will help those who want to find the 'break'. The abolition of
 apavaahana is something mentioned by the emperor himself that was bound to result in loss of revenue and the enterpreneurship of the state. I need not state them here. After Kosambi and Romila Thapar it is not necessary to speculate on the break, nor difficult to do away with the previous garbage.
The present correspondent's study is in Bengali , hence will not help

Asoka was a reformer breaking with the past.
As a reformer AND a politician - how far would A?oka go with his project of ?breaking with the past?
To even try to answer this we would first need to know what was his idea about what constituted the past.?
