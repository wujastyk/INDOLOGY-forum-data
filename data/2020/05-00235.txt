Dear friends,
On behalf of a colleague whose access to collections is hampered by present circumstances,
I wish to ask if anyone might have an available soft copy of
Kodo Yotsuya's The Critique of Svatantra Reasoning by Candrak?rti and Tsong-kha-pa: A Study of Philosophical Proof According to Two Pr?sa?gika Madhyamaka Traditions of India and Tibet (Franz Steiner Verlag, 1999).
with thanks in advance,
Matthew
