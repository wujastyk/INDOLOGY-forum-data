Dear List,

I am working on a translation of the Pali Assalayana-sutta into Polish.

And - the problem, with the term vekura?ja. It appears in the text only
once, meaning - according to the context - possibly 'hybrid; crossbreed'.
But - I would like to be sure. The term is missing from Rhys-Davids and
Stede's dictionary, nor is it to be found (in some Sanskrit form) in the
Monier-Williams' dictionary.

Any tips - please?

With anti-pandemic greetings,

Artur Karp
