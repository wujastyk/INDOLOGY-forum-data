=?utf-8?Q?[INDOLOGY]_vekura=C3=B1ja?=
Dear List,
I am working on a translation of the Pali Assalayana-sutta into Polish.
And - the problem, with the term vekura?ja. It appears in the text only
once, meaning - according to the context - possibly 'hybrid; crossbreed'.
But - I would like to be sure. The term is missing from Rhys-Davids and
Stede's dictionary, nor is it to be found (in some Sanskrit form) in the
Monier-Williams' dictionary.
Any tips - please?
With anti-pandemic greetings,
Artur Karp
