Subject: [INDOLOGY] Techniques of Blinding

"yog??jana" could mean "magic ointment" (magic<-yogic), or "an ointment
consisting of a medicinal compound."

The *sam?sa* may refer deictically to poisons or corrosive substances
(denotation), but that's not what the *sam?sa* means lexically (i.e.,
semantically).

*Arka*, Purple Calotropis <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calotropis>, is a
milkweed with a corrosive, poisonous sap. *Snuh?*, a spurge
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphorbia#Irritants>, similarly has white,
corrosive sap.  Etc.

Best,
Dominik
