The *Conference on the Study of Religions of India (CSRI)* invites
proposals for its upcoming Annual Meeting to be held at the University of
Madras, India on July 21-24, 2020. The conference theme is*"Containment,
Collection, and Arrangement* *in South Asian Religions.?* We invite
proposals representing a range of disciplinary and methodological
approaches that focus on the actual, metaphorical or conceptual storage,
movement, or organization of objects and substances of significance in
religious texts, ritual practices, institutional structures and/or
individual behaviour. Possible topics could include the organization of *m*
*?**rti*s in temple architecture; the disposition of materials in ritual;
episodes of hiding, finding or losing sacred objects in Epics and other
narrative traditions; philosophical or theological accounts of perception
and memory; classificatory schemes that demarcate the structure of the
human person (e.g., *cakras*, faculties), the cosmos and/or social and
cultural institutions; monastic traditions of manuscript collection and
organization, and so forth. Conference organizers welcome individual paper
proposals that articulate a clear argument and its connection to the
conference theme of no longer than 250 words to be submitted through the
CSRI website at https://digitalcommons.butler.edu/csri/
