[INDOLOGY] Grammatical question
Dear George,
     As per P??ini's rules, a word-final *m* changes to *anusv?ra *before
any consonant [*mo 'nusv?ra?, hali*].  Then come option rules.  Before
*y/v/l*, an *anusv?ra *can optionally change to nasal versions of *y/v/l*.
Before the stops, it can optionally change to a nasal homogeneous with
the following stop [*parasavar?a*].  This leaves *r/?/?/s/h*, and before
these it remains *anusv?ra*.  In some Vedic traditions, in this last
environment, it becomes *n?sikya *or *ra?ga*.  Then there are rules which
change *n* into an *anusv?ra *in some environments.  This is the general
description according to P??ini.  Some other grammars do allow an *m
*occurring at
the end of an occurrence before a pause to change into *anusv?ra*,
reflecting some local variation.  Of course, the actual pronunciation
of an *anusv?ra
*probably differed regionally as we notice today, and different Vedic
traditions have conventionally settled ways of its pronunciation.  Also
rules that are optional in P??ini don't necessarily remain optional in
various Vedic tradition.  In most Vedic recitations I have heard, the
change of an *anusv?ra *into a *parasavar?a *nasal is almost done
invariably.
