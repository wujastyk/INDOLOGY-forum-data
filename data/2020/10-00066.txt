[INDOLOGY] Six calamities
Thank you much, dear Peter, for the reference.
Now I can add the following article  by F. Wilhelm in IT, precisely on the topic ("Calamities - a dharma problem?) :
http://www.asiainstitutetorino.it/Indologica/volumes/vol23-24/vol23-24_art38_WILHELM.pdf <http://www.asiainstitutetorino.it/Indologica/volumes/vol23-24/vol23-24_art38_WILHELM.pdf>
Anyway, the ?loka below (also quoted in a commentary to the final stanza of M?lavik?gnimitra, according to Wilhelm) must be earlier than its occurrence in the K?tyakalpataru and V?ramitrodaya digests.
