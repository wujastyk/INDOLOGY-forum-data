A. Weber, ?atapatha Br?hma?a in the M?dhyandina...is the critical edition go to (if memory serves, GRETIL is based on this).  It may be available on archive.org. There is also The ?atapatha-Br?hma?a, ed. Sanskrit with notes and index by Maitreyi Deshpande (also with trans of Julius Eggeling), New Bharatiya Book Corp. 4. vols., 2008.
As for K??va, see also the text and trans of CR Swaminathan, K??va?atapathabr?hma?am, Indira Gandhi National Center for the Arts, New Delhi, 7 vols., 1994-2015.

[INDOLOGY] ?atapatha Br?hmana PDF needed
Dear list members,
1) Does anyone have a pdf of  The ?atapatha Br?hmana in the K??v?ya Recension by Caland .  I was only able to find Vol. II part 2 on archive.org<http://archive.org>.  If someone has the other parts and could send them to me I'd greatly appreciate it.
2) Also what is the most reliable printed edition of the mAdhyandina recension?.  If someone has this and could send it or point to an online version of it would be great   I know there is an etext in GRETIL but as far as I can see there is no information about what printed edition the GRETIL text is from.
Thanks,
Harry Spier
