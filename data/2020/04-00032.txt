Subject: [INDOLOGY] Resources on indigenous Bangladeshi plants
Message-ID: <CA+zzeirHDV=eFiy9mzOcvdY37vbOoJ8HrAE2DhJ3LCOU2nFpow@mail.gmail.com>

Does anyone have recommendations for sources on names, classifications and
morphologies of indigenous Bangladeshi plants?

Thanks in advanced for any suggestions,

David Mellins
