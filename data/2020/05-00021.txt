[INDOLOGY] Techniques of Blinding
Dear Colleagues,
I take the advantage of the muted attempts at postmodern creative writing
in Sanskrit to post a request pertaining to the study of material culture
and social history in mediaeval India. My source is a representative of ?
if I might say so ? ?Sanskrit literary realism?, namely Kavi ?r?vara, who
depicts a technique of blinding in his *R?jatara?gi??* as it was practised
in Kashmir between c. AD 1472 and 1474.
Most of you will certainly be aware of the prevailing practice in South
Asia of using acid, and possibly of the touching blinding scene shown in
Slumdog Millionaire:

but what ?r?vara was watching as an eyewitness at the royal court he was
serving in Sultanate Kashmir was done differently. It comes closer to the
verbatim meaning of *netra-utp??ana* (?tearing out one?s eyes?), as they
seem to have gouged out the eyes of the victim, to wit, Bahr?m Kh?n,
pretender to the throne and uncle of the ruling Sultan Hassan:
*tasya t?l?cite netradvaye tapt?? ?al?kik?m* |
*Jonar?j?nako lauh?? d??n???rtham ad?payat* || III.107 ||
[107]In order to destroy [Bahr?m?s] eyesight, the R?j?naka Jona
administered a red-hot copper needle to [his] eyeballs, which had been
covered with cotton.
?r?vara comments:
*nairgh??yam ak?ihartur yat k????k?asya ca y? vyath?* |
*dvaya? na ?akyate vaktu? yath?rtha? m?d???? gir?* || III.108 ||
[108][Poets] like me have no words to express in an adequate manner the
heartlessness of the one who took his eyes and the agony of the one from
whom they were torn.
It is not the only instance of *netrotp??ana* in his work, however to my
present knowledge it is the only one to render precise details.
In preparation of a new edition and annotated translation of ?r?vara?s
masterpiece I would like to ask if someone might be aware of any other
source having preserved details of the techniques of blinding in India? My
request does not concern the undisputed occurrence of *netrotp??ana*, but
only the techniques, if known.
On- and off-list replies would be equally welcome.
Thanking you,
Walter Slaje
