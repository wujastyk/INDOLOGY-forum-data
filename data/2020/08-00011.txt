Dear Madhav,

There is a similar example in the name Sahampati given to one of the 
Brahmas who features in the Pali Canon. Przyluski argued that originally 
this must have been Sabhaapati ("lord of the assembly [of gods]"). See 
J. Przyluski, "Brahma Sahampati," /Journal Asiatique/ 205 (1924): 
155-163. I don't think he really explains *why* this nasal gets infixed, 
but he does summon several examples to show that it is not an isolated 
incident.

Best,
