Subject: [INDOLOGY] A distraction from the Coronavirus

As you can see, Prof. Deshpande only clapped three times, one clapping hand
for each correct P?da. He used the dhvani of the missing hand to mark the
first p?da gentlemanly as incorrect.

In contrast, 24 carrots were awarded for the full number of 4 P?das, six
carrots each, although the quality is clearly unequally distributed over
the p?das. The assessment was therefore inadequate. Adequate would have
been 18 carrots at best, which is easy to understand if you subtract 6 of
your carrots for the failed P?da a.

Leaving aside that we have just learned that correct grammar plays no
significant role in assessing Sanskrit poetry, and, obviously, it never
has. Just look at the language of the ancient kavis. Wherever you look, no
trace of grammar.
