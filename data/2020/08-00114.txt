I am looking for an article by Chandraleka Vamadeva, "The Concept of Van?n?an?pu 'Violent Love' in Tamil ?aivism, with special reference to the Periyapura?n?am" (Uppsala studies in the history of religions), 1995. I?d be most grateful if anyone has a pdf that they could make available. Thanks, George Hart
