[INDOLOGY] Mahabharata with Nilakantha's PDF
I found this post on FB posted by Nityananda Misra. Unfortunately this
particular edition I am searching is removed from the website. If any has
downloaded please send me the pdf files.
Thanks.

This is the first page of the Mahabharata with the commentary of
Nilakantha, published by Gopal Narayan & Co in 1901 at Bombay. Note the
ornate patterns printed with blocks.
