[INDOLOGY] Metrical inconsistencies and tradition
kukavit? is as risky as the covid according to Bh?maha:
n?kavitvam adharm?ye  m?taye da??an?ya v? |
kukavitva? puna? s?k??n  m?tim ?hur man??i?a? ||
I just found the verse in one Anthology (SRH p. 138) but see now than Victor Davella has dealt with in his philological dissertation (UChicago, 2018, p. 70) - here his translation:
Not being a poet does not lead to demerit, sickness or punishment, but being a bad poet, the wise say, truly spells death.
