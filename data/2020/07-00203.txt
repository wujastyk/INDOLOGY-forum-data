Dear Krishna Prasad Ji,
     A great load of thanks are due to you and your Adishila font creator
team for their tireless work and making this beautiful set of fonts
available free of cost to the world of Sanskrit scholarship.  I
congratulate you from the bottom of my heart.  Having spent many years of
my own life in designing fonts, I know how much of hard work is involved in
this task.  With best regards,
