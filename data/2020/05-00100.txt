Dear all,

I am editing Ma?gapa's unpublished commentary on the Bhik???anak?vya by Utprek??vallabha. Do you have any reading suggestions on the poem? 
Also, can you point to any material regarding the Ummattur Wodeyars of Southern Karnakata? (Ma?gapa belongs to this family). A relevant inscription has been published in the Annual Report on Indian Epigraphy for the year 1900 (aka Government Order (epigraphy) or Madras Epigraphical Record or Annual Report on Epigraphy): but I can?t find it.

Thank you,

Alessandro Battistini/University of Bologna
