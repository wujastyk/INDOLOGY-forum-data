[INDOLOGY] Manusmriti ... (Olivelle, J P)
Dear V.S. Rajam,
Thanks for having raised these points including those to current events in
Tamilnadu, useful to know even for list members who primarily want or hope
to be able to pursue their Indological studies as an enterprise of 'pure
science'.
The ways of use and abuse of a text are almost limitless, and one of these
uses, probably one of the most valid ones, is: to better understand an
ancient society.
If that is our aim, the Manusmrti as a source on the position of women in
classical India has to be supplemented, minimally, by the Mah?bh?rata,
Sources on the Buddha and ?mrap?l? and on the Buddha and women aspiring to
become nuns, the K?mas?tra ... a closer study from a modern politicized
perspective may or may not lead to the burning of these sources as well...
With best regards,
Jan Houben
