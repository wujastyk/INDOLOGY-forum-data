[INDOLOGY] Grammatical question
Dear Victor,
     Your reference to "the word sa?skart? can be pronounced 108 different
ways according to (some) grammarians. See Bha??oj? D?k?ita ad P. 8.3.34 (SK
138)" reminded me of my early days of reading Panini, and the dread that I
felt as a student about having to explain these 108 variations in an exam.
There is a comic verse about the other example of ????+??????: where
numerous alternative forms are produced by using all possible options of
reduplication.  I don't fully remember it but the verse goes something like
???: ?????? ..???: ??? .. ?????????????? ???: ?????.  It just tells you
about how many students drop dead by the dread of these examples. Perhaps
Ashok Aklujkar or Saroja Bhate will recall the verse.
