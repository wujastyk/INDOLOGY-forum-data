[INDOLOGY] (still) no distraction from the coronavirus...
Dear Jean-Luc,
This is as fascinating as it is puzzling.
Have the translations of (parts of) the Tolk?ppiyam by K. Zvelebil ever
been published?
See his announcement of a translation in his *The Smile** Of Murugan*,
Leiden, 1973, p. 131.
Stay healthy and well in M?ssen,
Jan
P.S.
for the children in M?ssen, during the corona-crisis:
??????????????? ??? ????????   ???? ? ?? ???????? ?
This one I will translate, freely, into German:
"Was kann man machen in M?ssen?
Nur lachen, nicht k?ssen."
P.P.S.
Did anyone ever try to transcribe into Sanskrit -- into Devanagari -- the
German "?" or French "u" or Dutch "uu"?
Max M?ller sanskritized his name simply as ????? ???? according to my
teacher Prof. Henk Bodewitz in order to suggest to his Indian readers that
he can bring them liberation, but in that way M.M. skipped the problem of
the transcription of this phoneme that is absent in Sanskrit and in Hindi
and in most other Indian languages I know of (but a similar sound is there
in Tibetan, if I'm not mistaken).
