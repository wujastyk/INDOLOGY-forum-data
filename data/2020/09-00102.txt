[INDOLOGY] locative of goal
Hello,
Speijer has a section on the "locative of the spot whither" (pp. 103f.
https://archive.org/details/cu31924023201183/page/n117/mode/2up) and gives
several examples from classical Sanskrit texts, although not all of them
would necessitate, in my opinion, the interpretation of "spot whither" such
as "to submerge in", but others are really a place to which someone is
going as in sam?pavartini nagare prasthita? (Pa?catantra 41). Off the top
of my head I also don't know of any particular discussion in Sanskrit
grammatical literature about this usage, and Speijer gives no references. I
too am interested in knowing more.
All the Best,
Victor
