[INDOLOGY] Translations
I have received a query from a scholar not on this list about translations of Sanskrit texts into other Indian languages in the medieval period, say pre- 17th century. If any of you know such translations, I?d be delighted to get some information on them.
With thanks and best wishes,
Patrick Olivelle
