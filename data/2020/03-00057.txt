Thank you to everyone who replied on and off line.  The font is for a
colleague who will be entering small amounts of text (bhajans) and will be
having some helpers typing in from home.  So are there on-line or
dpwnloadable tools for typing in Kannada text  (keyboards or online sites
for text conversion etc.)
Thanks,
Harry Spier
