[INDOLOGY] locative of goal
Perhaps you are thinking of examples such as carma?i dv?pina? hanti "he kills the tiger for its skin"? A few such examples occur in the Mah?bh??ya under P. 2.3.6 vt. 6; also in the K??ik? under that s?tra.

Dear list members,
can anybody point me to the Sutra/Bhashya in which Panini or the later Paniniyas state their view(s) regarding the grammaticality of locatives that denote the goal of a motion verb like gam- (as, e.g., in RV 7.32.10d gamat sa gomati vraje)? Even after hours of searching, I have to confess that I failed to find any Sutra/Bhashya vel sim. explicitely allowing this particular use of the locative...
NB: I am aware that the (from our perspective intransitive) motion verbs count as sakarmakas in native grammar and thus the accusative usually applies (apart from some cases in which the dative is licensed as well).
Thanks a lot in advance
Tim
