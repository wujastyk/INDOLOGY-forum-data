[INDOLOGY] "Psychological complexity" of Sanskrit language/literature
Dear Professor Wujastyk,
Thank you very much for drawing my attention to these publications.
I don't quite agree with Tuske on many points, and I can tell a lot about
how these "philosophical" traditions welcome and promote the
cultivation of *positive
*feelings and emotions, such as infinite selfless love, compassion,
contentedness, tranquil joy etc (contra his thesis that they seek to
eradicate "emotions"), but, regardless of that, the very last sentence of
his paper strikes me the most, as my question was about *the very language
of the tradition*:
"However, any comparison must be sensitive to the difficulties in
translating the concepts involved".
This is exactly what I am talking about: how we are supposed to understand
the texts, if we can not even translate them adequately, find the right
words...
Kind regards,
Gleb Sharygin

Just for the record, there is some theorization of the topic of emotion in
Indian cultural history, but not nearly enough.
   - Bilimoria, P. and Wenta, A., eds. (2014) *Emotions in Indian
   Thought-systems*. New Delhi: Routledge.
   - Pollock, S. (2016) *A Rasa Reader: Classical Indian Aesthetics,
   Historical Sourcebooks in Classical Indian Thought*. New York: Columbia
   University Press.
   - Tuske, J. (2011) ?The Concept of Emotion in Classical Indian
   Philosophy,? in *The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy*. Stanford:
   Stanford University, pp. 1?30. Available at:
   http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2011/entries/concept-emotion-india/
   .
Tuske's conclusions are cogent and compelling, I think, but perhaps
challenging for people coming to this for the first time.
