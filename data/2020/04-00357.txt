[INDOLOGY] Methods for Sterilization and Contraception article
This is really in the *Indian Journal of History of Science* (published by
INSA).  Should be downloadable from http://www.insa.nic.in but the server
is down as I write this email.  You might be able to get it from the

In general, with IJHS articles, you can just do a google search for the
title and you'll get a PDF returned.  Google says the article you're after
is found here:
