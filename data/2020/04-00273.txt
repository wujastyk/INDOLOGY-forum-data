[INDOLOGY] Grammatical question
I?ve been enjoying the discussion on Indology. A friend had a question about Sanskrit that I could not answer properly. It involves the pronunciation of anusv?ra before various consonants. I believe that before y, r, l and v, it is nasalized. Assuming that is correct, is it also nasalized before ?, ?, s and h? Some people say samsk?ta, with an m sound, but I always assumed it was a nasal sound. I think the nasal is put in the same phonetic category as the ? etc. ? i.e.in a??a it is a palatal nasal, in sa?sk?ta it is a dental nasal, and in si?ha it is sort of a velar nasal sound. The problem is, everyone seems to say simha (m sound), not the nasal sound. What do the grammarians say? Is there a correct pronunciation, or can one choose between the nasal and the ?m? before ?, ?, s and h? George Hart
