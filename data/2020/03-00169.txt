[INDOLOGY] The study of Sanskrit as the epitome of uselessness
I recall a short story (I forgot the title. It's the first story, I believe, in the collection *Fantastische vertellingen*) by the Dutch author Ferdinand Bordewijk, in which a student in Leiden complains that in Sanskrit class they have to read K?lid?sa, whose name according to this student is a misnomer: he ought to be called 'Kan-die-dazen' (translatable as 'man, can he blab a lot of nonsense').
