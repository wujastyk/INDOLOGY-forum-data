[INDOLOGY] Need assistance
I have joined a Marathi group here in the Bay Area that plans to read
J??ne?vara's Amr?t?nubhava.  The very first verse salutes Nivr?ttin?tha as
his Guru.  I have tried to locate compositions of Nivr?ttin?tha himself,
without any success so far.  I would appreciate any help on sources, and
also on the connection of Nivr?ttin?tha to the N?tha tradition, and the
connection of the N?tha tradition to Kashmiri Shavism.  With best wishes,
