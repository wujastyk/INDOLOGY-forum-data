[INDOLOGY] corona deaths
All:
	I usually delete the poetry msgs. It has become so frequent and dominant that I considered unsubscribing this morning, which is sad, since this is supposed to be a scholarly list serve. Please post poetry (albeit skilled) and nonsense neo-Vedanta preaching for other lists and contexts, that Indology members can create on their own. Can the Indology admins please step in and make executive decisions about this before Indology becomes RISA-L?
sincerely secular and skeptical,
