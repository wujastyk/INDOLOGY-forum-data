[INDOLOGY] poison
Dear Jonathan and Charles,
the Nepalese (Muluk? )Ain of 1854 has some mention of poison and their treatment. I especially like this section, which might be also useful for some Western doctors:
?If an experienced doctor gives to someone a poisonous substance such as ajaip?la, yellow orpiment, somala, or sa?khy?[1] without [previously] purifying and cooking it, or administers any other herb by following the [prescribed] procedure (k?y? pugnu), [but] without purifying it and without mixing it [with other substances], and if that person dies, that doctor shall be made to consume the same medicine in the same dosage as he had ordered the deceased to consume; if that doctor also dies, it has then been ascertained that the doctor did it out of malice. His life has gone for the life [being taken]. If nothing happens to him, it has then been ascertained that [the patient] died of a natural cause. No accusation shall be made against [the doctor] who has ordered the consumption. If a Brahmin doctor orders the consumption [of the medicine] and [the patient] dies, the same dose shall be prepared and fed to a dog or goat and if it dies, it has then been ascertained that he did it out of malice, and thus the Brahmin doctor shall be branded.? ( Ain of 1854, ? 54.2)
  1.  ajaip?la might refer to baliospermum montanum or jatropha glandulifera, sa?khy? (=sa?khiy?) to oxidum arsenicum and somala to the soma plant (whatever is meant by this).
All best wishes to both of you,
Axel
p.s. Charly, I?m happy to send you the Nep?l? text, but you also find it easily in Fezas? edition.

[INDOLOGY] poison
Dear Friends
My friend Charles Ramble is working on a Tibetan text on poison. It mentions for instance 32 types. I am aware that (no doubt among others) Su?rutasa?hit? in its Kalpasth?na has much to say about poison, but understandably, not how to make it. There seems to exist a term vi?a??stra, but more I have not been able to discover. I feel I may have overlooked something rather well known.
I would be delighted both to learn more myself (no, I'm not looking to poison anyone!) and to pass along the information to Charles.
Very best,
Jonathan
