[INDOLOGY] query about publication announcement on book on buddhism
Dear Prof. Pandurangi,
Perhaps you are thinking of this book by Kamaleswar Bhattacharya, *The
?tman-Brahman in Ancient Buddhism*. It was announced here:

An Indian reprint of it from Motilal Banarsidass is also now available.
Best regards,
