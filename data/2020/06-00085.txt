A training to sing meters in this pattern as bhajan can be found here where
Upadesa Saram by Ramana Maharshi is being sung with the title, "Learn to
Chant Upadesa Saram"
https://www.sriramanamaharshi.org/resource_centre/learn-to-chant-upadesa-saram/
The same style is applicable to Gopee Geetam too.
Upadesa Saaram has no consistent gurulagu pattern. But the pattern of
maatraa gaNas is uniform. 8 + 8 which comes under chaturasra gati
Taala-wise.
Kanakamanjaree, Vainasam , Nirasikaa --all have the same 8 + 8  chaturasra
gati rhythm.
