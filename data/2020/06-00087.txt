[INDOLOGY] Article needed
Greetings everyone,
I wonder if anyone could supply me with a copy of the following article,
which is not currently available to me due to library closure:
Lore Sander, "A Graffito with the Quintessence of Buddhist Doctrine from
Ladakh," in *Festschrift Klaus Bruhn zu Vollendung des 65. Lebensjahres, *ed.
N. Balbir and J.K. Bautze (Reinbek: Verlag fuer Orientalistische
Fachpublikationen, 1994), pp. 561-570.
Thanks in advance,
Rich Salomon
