[INDOLOGY] Nick Allen
Oh, I'm very sorry to hear this sad news.  Nick was a major part of Indian
studies at Oxford for half a century.  He always pushed the boundaries of
our understanding of ancient Indian epics and culture, a unique voice.
I send my condolences to his friends, colleagues and students.
