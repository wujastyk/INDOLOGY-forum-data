[INDOLOGY] once again, a scan?
Dear Friends
I wonder if anyone might have a copy of A.M. Tabard's English translation
of the Introduction (?) to Lac?te's Essai sur Gu???hya et la Br?hatkath?
(Bangalore: Bangalore Press, 1923). I believe this first appeared in the
Quarterly of the Mythic Society 1913-1914, but except for the first 10
pages I could not find the latter online anywhere either, and our library
has neither, seemingly. I do have the French, but for the sake of
completeness it would be nice to see the English if someone might have it.
With very best thanks in advance, Jonathan
