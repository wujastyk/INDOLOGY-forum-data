[INDOLOGY] "Psychological complexity" of Sanskrit language/literature
Dear Gleb,
I dimly remember the study that I read some 15 years ago by an Indian
due to its history and stylistic conventions, has many more words for
pretty much anything than most other languages do, literary/ancient or not.
Also, my guiding principle in the questions you ask would be to make sure I
keep questions of language/grammar and of literature/style very clearly
separate. The one truly linguistic aspect of a language that could express
its 'psychological complexity' to me would be its lexicon (unless we were
to consider morphemes such as inclusive 'we' vs exclusive 'we' that are
found in some languages, but not e.g. Sanskrit; or perhaps verbal moods
that distinguish between 'would', 'could' and 'should', all expressed by
the same verbal category in Classical Sanskrit). The main distinguishing
features of the Sanskrit lexicon (I am here thinking especially of the fact
that it has such a beautiful wealth of synonyms) seem to be due to the
pressure to be innovative that writers using a grammatically fixed language
could only channel in a limited variety of ways.
That said, I would be greatly interested in literature that shows my
curmudgeonly attitude to be wrong:-).
All the very best,
     Antonia
