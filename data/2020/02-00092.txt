[INDOLOGY] NWS Update
Dear Colleagues,
it is my pleasure to inform you that the "Supplementary Dictionary of
Sanskrit" (NWS) has now been extended by about 4,500 additions from
Monier-Williams and can already be researched in its currently updated
form. Work on the enlargement is not yet completed and will continue.
The total number of lemmata from a total of 169 supplementary works entered
in the NWS is presently 112,674 entries.
For further information on the guidelines for the inclusion of addenda and
use of this dictionary, please see

With my very best wishes,
Walter Slaje
