Subject: [INDOLOGY] Texts about translators and translation?

Dear Nataliya (and her student),



not yet mentioned by the contributors on this topic, there is quite a
substantial

book not directly thematizing the practice of translation, but the
hermeneutical

presuppositions for semantic understanding, hence translating. Benefitting
one?s

so-called ?prestructure of understanding? (in Gadamer?s terminology), i.e.,
what

Dominic has pointed out as ?presuppositions [which] too often remain
unexamined?

(right at the beginning of his remarks ?On translation?), it investigates
some of the

underlying classical Indian principles of hermeneutics:



Eivind Kahrs, *Indian Semantic Analysis. The *nirvacana* Tradition*,
Cambridge 1998.



Best wishes, Hartmut



P.S.: My mind somehow getting drawn into reflections on this subject,
fingers

finding their way to the keyboard, I noted down some *ad hoc* reflections;
following

Dominic?s example, I send them along with this mail to the list as an
attachment.
