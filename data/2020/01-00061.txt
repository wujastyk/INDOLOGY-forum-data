[INDOLOGY] Texts about translators and translation?
Dear Nataliya (and her student),
not yet mentioned by the contributors on this topic, there is quite a
substantial
book not directly thematizing the practice of translation, but the
hermeneutical
presuppositions for semantic understanding, hence translating. Benefitting
one?s
so-called ?prestructure of understanding? (in Gadamer?s terminology), i.e.,
what
Dominic has pointed out as ?presuppositions [which] too often remain
unexamined?
(right at the beginning of his remarks ?On translation?), it investigates
some of the
underlying classical Indian principles of hermeneutics:
Eivind Kahrs, *Indian Semantic Analysis. The *nirvacana* Tradition*,
Cambridge 1998.
Best wishes, Hartmut
P.S.: My mind somehow getting drawn into reflections on this subject,
fingers
finding their way to the keyboard, I noted down some *ad hoc* reflections;
following
Dominic?s example, I send them along with this mail to the list as an
attachment.
