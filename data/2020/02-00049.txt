Dear Finnian,
OMissions will be OMinous if you set out to chart the OMnipresence of OM.
To test -- to try to falsify and perhaps ultimately fortify -- your Vedic
origin thesis you could think of giving a higher priority precisely to
those textual corpora that seem to be farthest removed: Buddhism and
Jainism.
And of course to the use of OM in Tamil --

Neither proponents (starting with Asko Parpola 1981; now also Roots of
Hinduism p. 170) nor opponents (Hans H. Hock 1991) of the Tamil-origin
thesis seem to have verified or explored the use of OM in ancient religious
Tamil texts (but they have emphasized and accepted its use -- in the form
of AAM/OM -- in colloquial contexts in the meaning 'yes'): would we not
expect a quite extensive use of AAM/OM there? ... unless the theory is that
its original use in Dravidian was and remained exclusively communicative
and functional and that its religious symbolism was first conceived of and
developed exclusively in Vedic and Sanskrit circles...
Best regards,
Jan Houben
