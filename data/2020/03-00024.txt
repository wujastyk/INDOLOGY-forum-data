[INDOLOGY] rhetorical questions in Sanskrit
Dear Matthew,
It is an interesting question and I'd be curious to see what others say.
The category of "rhetorical question," I suppose, includes questions to
which the speaker does not actually expect an informative answer, including
questions in which the answer is implicit in the question. I have seen
pra?navy?j?na, "in the guise of a question," but not in this sense (rather
when one asks a question in order to distract someone from some other
topic).
One interesting approach is offered by the anonymous commentator on
?aktibhadra's ??caryac???ma?i. He distinguishes surface meaning from "final
meaning" (v?kyaparyavas?nam). So R?va?a's verse at 3.17 (yudhi sarabhasa?
hatv? r?ma? bal?n mayi gr?h?ati svayam anucit? bhartu? ??k?d as?n na kim
ujjhati) is a question, on the surface, which the commentator answers
(ujjhaty ?va). But he then explains the presumptive answer (S?t? will die
if R?ma is killed) as a reason for a further conclusion (therefore R?ma
ought not to be killed). That conclusion is the final meaning (yata ?va?
gr?h?t? s? pr???n parityajati at? r?mahanana? bal?d graha?a? ca na
kartavyam iti v?kyaparyavas?nam). So a rhetorical question might be one
which has the form of a question but has the "final meaning" of something
else, in this case a prohibition. The reverse happens sometimes too, where
something that has the form of a statement is read as a question in its
"final meaning" (e.g., "I see that you're the only one in this ashram" >
"why are you the only one here?").
