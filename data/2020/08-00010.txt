What is the source of the pattern in names like ??????????, ???????????,
????????? etc?  This is very common in Maharashtra as well.  Our family
Purohita was one ????????, and according to a genealogy of our family
transmitted to me by my father, our ancestor 16 generations ago was someone
named ??????.  Where does this addition of ??? come from?  I see this in
names like Krishnamacharya and Annamacharya.
