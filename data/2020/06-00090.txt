Dear Harry,
Since Vaman Shivram Apte (1858 ? 9 August 1892) died before the 1895
publication of the Mand?ramarandacamp? by the Nirnaya Sagara Press, the
reference to this publication must be the work of one of the later editors
of Apte's dictionary who expanded the original dictionary.  The three
volume edition from 1959 represents such expansions.
