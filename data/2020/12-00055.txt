Dear colleagues,

I am delighted to announce the publication of A Garland of Forgotten Goddesses: Tales of the Feminine Divine from India and Beyond (UC Press).

It is an anthology of primary source stories, each followed with a brief essay describing the historical and social context. I designed it as a teaching resource, but it also highlights cutting-edge research since none of these sources were previously available in translation (and several had never been published in their original languages).  A diverse range of sources includes a passage from the c.6th century Skanda Purana, exciting narratives and visualization guides from early-medieval Tantras, literature from Nepal and Indonesia highlighting women and their relationship with goddesses, local Puranas, songs, and stories translated from modern booklets marketed to pilgrims.
