[INDOLOGY] History of Indian Glass by M.G. Dikshit (1969)
Dear Andrey,
No, I do not, and will be grateful if you can share in case you manage to obtain a pdf. In the meantime, two related references that have probably not yet come to your attention:
J?kl, Ji??. 2017. ?Liquor in Glass Vessels: A Note on Glassware in Pre-Islamic Java and on Its Socio-Religious Symbolism.? Archipel: ?tudes interdisciplinaires sur le monde Insulindien 93: 15?29. https://doi.org/10.4000/archipel.404.
Perret, Daniel, and Zulkifli Jaafar. 2014. Ancient Glassware in Malaysia: The Pengkalan Bujang Collection. Kuala Lumpur: Department of Museums Malaysia.
Despite focus on Southeast Asia, both are heavily concerned with production and use of glassware in ancient Indian.
Best wishes,
Arlo
