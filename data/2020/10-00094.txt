[INDOLOGY] diacritical marks on Mac
Dear friends,
I recently bought a new MacBook Pro with the OS Catalina.
My old MacBook had an earlier OS, in which it was quite easy to locate characters with diacritical marks not among the standard Mac accents, which would then be stored in a tab called 'favorites' with keyboard preferences.
In Catalina, that is gone, and I do not see any easy way to locate and insert the diacritical marks. I would be grateful for some pointers.
with thanks in advance,
Matthew
