[INDOLOGY] + symbol in a few entries in Aufrecht's Catalogus Catalogorum
Dear Friends,
In ~30 entries of Afrecht's Catalogus Catalogorum a + symbol is used for example below for the entry for agastya.

I was wondering if anyone on this list has worked out what this indicates as in the text itself no reference is given.
Here is a link to the scans for those without them handy:

Any insights are much appreciated!
With kindest wishes,
