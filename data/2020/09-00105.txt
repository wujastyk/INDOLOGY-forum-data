[INDOLOGY] Question
The question arose because someone asked me if the word *pratibh? *will
have alternative forms similar to forms of *subhr?*, like *subhruve/subhruvai
*etc.  After thinking further about this question, I came to the conclusion
that since we typically use the word *subhr? *in feminine, it has those
alternative forms similar to *matyai/mataye*, but we typically use the
word *pratibh?
*"guarantor" in masculine, it will not have such alternative forms.
However, if for some reason, this guarantor happened to be a woman, then we
could get the alternative forms like *pratibhuve/pratibhuvai*.  I have not
seen these forms in actual attestations, but in theory, this is my
understanding. Does it make sense?
