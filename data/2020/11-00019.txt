Dear list, 

I am trying to make sense of a description of a gameboard occuring in
the Kr???vi??ati section of the _M?nasoll?sa_ (5.826cd-830ab) dated to
c. 1131 CE. I am using Gondekar's critical edition from 1961 based on
three manuscripts (one of which was merely a copy of one of the other
two). No further manuscripts of the Kr???vi??ati section are available,
and as Gondekar writes in his introduction to the edition: "[a]s all the
three mss. are corrupt the constitution of the text became very
difficult" (ibid. ix). 

My own difficulties at present are mostly concerned with 5.828cd-829 on
the ornamentation of the gameboard, but I quote the description in full
below for context. While the variant readings offer little help,
Gondekar's generally convincing emendations appear in square brackets.
The translation is entirely my own. 

As a final note, it should be mentioned that the game in question
(called Pha?jik?) is reminiscent of the cruciform game of
_pacc?s?_/_caupa?_ which, however, is only attested from around 1500 CE.


--- 

_a???da???gula? k?rya? caturasra? tu ma??alam // 826_ 

A square diagram (measuring) eighteen _a?gula_s (on each side) should be
made. 

_t?d???ni caturdik?u bhastrak??i [bhadra?] prakalpayet /_ 

One should arrange such (18x18 _a?gula_) projections in the four
directions (from the diagram). [NB! This results in a cruciform shape
consisting of 5 squares of equal size]. 

_a?gul?-traya-madhye tu rekh? k?ry? samantata? // 827_ 

A line should be drawn from all sides between (each unit of) three
_a?gula_s. [NB! This results in each of the 5 squares being divided into
6x6 squares]. 

_tatas tv [try-]a?gula-vist?ra [???] k???? [ko?] sarve bhavanti ca /_ 

Thereupon, all the squares [catu?ko???] have a width of three _a?gula_s
(on every side). 

_ardha-candra-sam?k?ra? geha? pha?ji-vi??rada? // 828_ 

_pr?s?da? pa?kaja? v?pi kha??a-v?ha? sapak?i?am /_ 

_catur-bhadr??i sa?lekhyad dvidvy-eva? ca manoharam // 829_ 

One skilled in _pha?ji_(_k?_) should draw [sa?likhed? Breaks the metre!]
the _geha_ [i.e., the central square?] in the form of a half-moon [i.e.,
with semi-circles indicating the starting positions of the pawns?],
(and) the four _bhadra_s [i.e., the four projecting squares?] as a
palace, a lotus, or a tree [branch-carrier?] with a bird; and thus the
four (become) captivating. [NB! _dvidvy-eva?_ might also be emended to
_vidhy eva?_, rendering the last line as "and thus you should know (the
diagram) as captivating."]

_eva? ma??ala-viny?sa? kathita? pha?cik?-[?jik?-]vidai? /_ 

Thus the arrangement of the diagram is explained by those who know (the
game of) _pha?jik?_. 

--- 

I was thinking that someone experienced in reading texts concerning the
drawing of _ma??ala_s or similar might be able to offer some insights.
But, certainly, any ideas or suggestions would be greatly appreciated! 

Best regards,
