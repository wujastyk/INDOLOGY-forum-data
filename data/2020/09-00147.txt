[INDOLOGY] MacDevnag on 64-bit systems
Dear TeXies on the list,
My university is pushing me to update my Mac OS to Catalina, which cannot run 32-bit applications.  I am still using MacDevnag as a preprocessor to generate Devanagari output from my LaTeX files.  I am going to appease them for now by upgrading to Mojave, which can run 32-bit (yes, I am an update laggard, still running [Low] Sierra!), but that is inevitably just a temporary fix.  I confess to being only semi-literate in LaTeX and XeLaTeX, so I may have missed a crucial new development.
So far as I can see from
https://bdesgraupes.pagesperso-orange.fr/sanskrit.html
 https://bdesgraupes.pagesperso-orange.fr/DocHTML/MacDevnagHelp/index.html
there is no 64-bit version, and likely never will be.
Those of you who are au courant, how should I be dealing with this problem.  Due to laggardliness, I am still finalizing a volume using MacDevnag and am reluctant to attempt to reconfigure things altogether at this late stage in the process.
With fingers crossed,
Tim
