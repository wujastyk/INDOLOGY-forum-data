[INDOLOGY] A distraction from the Coronavirus
Dear Roland,
The passages that you quote look like they are from epic/puranic works.
The norm in classical literature is to use *padma *in neuter gender, like
other words for the lotus.  I would stick with the neuter usage as far as
possible. Best wishes,
