Dear colleagues,
Does anyone have a copy, or know of a copy available in North America, of
the V?si??ha-dharmas?tra with the commentary Vidvanmodin? by Kr???a
Dharm?dhik?r?, published in Benares, 1878 [according to the reference in
Patrick Olivelle, *Dharmas?tras*, p. xvi]? I have been unable to find it
via the usual channels.
In particular, I am interested in the commentary on the rules for partition
of the estate in 17.40-54.
Thanks in advance,
Rich Salomon
