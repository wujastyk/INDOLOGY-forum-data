[INDOLOGY] A distraction from the Coronavirus
On this occasion, let me cite a few examples for *padma* as used in the
masculine gender by outstanding classical Kavis in addition to those
already quoted by Dr. Steiner:
In his *Har?acarita* (Ed. Kane, 1918), for instance, B??a seems to use
exclusively the masculine gender for *padma* (no trace of usage in the
neuter). This is all the more remarkable as B??a writes in prose. One can
therefore not invoke the metre as a possible cause:
tac chrutv? b??asya *catv?ra?* pit?mahamukha*padm?* iva [?]
(HC III p. 39,29)
atha [?] dvijavarasvecch?g?h?tako?o n?bhi*padma* iva [?]
(HC IV, p. 56,6)
??li?y?sya sakaladurmadamah?p?lamaulim?l?l?litau p?da*padm?v* [?]
(HC V, p. 86,24)
lilekha ma?iku??imam itara? p?da*padma?*
(HC VI, p. 96,23)
Moreover,
?r?har?a (*Nai?adhacarita*):
[?] sa cen mukham *aya? padma?* priye t?vakam [22.140]
Or, Ma?khakavi (*?r?ka??hacarita*):
[?] *padma? sa* va? padmabhuva? pun?tu ? *ya?* [?] ? 1.22. ?
Explanation by Kavi Jonar?ja: *ya? padma *[?] *sa padmo* va? pun?tu
Their usage is fully in line with the grammatical genders of padma (m., n.)
as given in the major Sanskrit dictionaries (pw, MW, Apte).
It is however a bit unfortunate that the Rigveda is unaware of the word
*padma*, which has become so common in later literature. We have no idea
what gender the rigvedic kavis would have assigned to padma, had it been
part of their vocabulary and poetic imagination.
