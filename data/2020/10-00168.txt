[INDOLOGY] Manusmriti ... (Olivelle, J P)
Thank you very much!!! You can imagine how it trickles down to Tamilnadu, especially to people who don?t know Sanskrit and who hate Hinduism, brahmins, ? and so on. People who hate brahmins use Manusmriti and similar texts as their tools in their politics. I wonder how many of them could read these original texts in Sanskrit. Depending upon the translations, everyone?s understanding and interpretation may vary. It is truly a sad scene. 
Thanks and Regards,
