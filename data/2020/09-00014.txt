Panduronga S. S. Pissurlencar, "A prop?sito dos primeiros livros maratas impressos em Goa", Boletim di Instituto da Gama 73, 1956, p. 55-79 ( http://memoria-africa.ua.pt/Library/ShowImage.aspx?q=/BIVG/BIVG-N073&p=1 ), refers to Jesuit manuscripts from Goa preserved at the Library of Braga (Portugal), dated to the end of the 16th century, with texts in Konkani and Marathi languages (in approximative Roman transcription); among the ones in Marathi, there would be a Bhagavadg?t?-??k? (Bhagavata-Guitechi-ttic?, ff? 209-233v) by one Nivr?tti-deva (Nivriti-deva) ? see p. 62 (but different reading of the same manuscript by L. A. Rodrigues, "Glimpses of the Konkani language at the turn of the sixteenth century, XIII: Ramayana and Mahabharata", Boletim do Instituto Menezes Bragan?a 163, 1991, p. 43-72,   https://issuu.com/redmackerel/docs/glimpses_-_xiv    t, p. 65). This Nivr?ttideva could correspond to Nivr?ttin?tha the elder brother and guru of  J??ne?vara.
As for the latter, according to Antonio Rigopoulos in Datt?treya. The immortal Guru, Yogin, and Avatara (State University of NY 1998; Sri Satguru Publ. 2000), p. 99:
 "According to tradition, J??ndev was initiated into the N?tha sect by his elder brother Nivr?tti, a disciple of Gahin?n?th, said to be the third or fourth in the Mar??h? nav-n?th lineage. Gahin?n?th and Gorakhn?th ? to whom the Viveka-darpa?a and the Gorakha-g?t? are attributed ? are considered to be the founders of mystical literature in Mar??h? that was subsequently taken up by J??ndev." 
(Rigopoulos deals also with the connections of Datt?treya's cult with Kashmir Shaivism in several places, e.g. pp. 171-172; there could be also things thereabout in Christian Bouy, Les N?tha-yogin et les Upani?ads: ?tude d'histoire de la litt?rature hindoue,  Paris, 1994, Publications e l'Institut de civilisation indienne, 62).

> I have joined a Marathi group here in the Bay Area that plans to read J??ne?vara's Amr?t?nubhava.  The very first verse salutes Nivr?ttin?tha as his Guru.  I have tried to locate compositions of Nivr?ttin?tha himself, without any success so far.  I would appreciate any help on sources, and also on the connection of Nivr?ttin?tha to the N?tha tradition, and the connection of the N?tha tradition to Kashmiri Shavism.  With best wishes,
