=?utf-8?Q?Re:_[INDOLOGY]_Vajras=C5=ABc=C4=AB?=
Dear colleagues,
allow me to qualify my previous remark about ?having not yet met with
the notion of an *?k??ag?min* in the various Buddhist philosophical
contexts
elaborating their notions of *m?rga *? ? ? in a beautifully suggestive
manner,
Prof. Schlingloff rightly pointed out to me, being habitually forgetful,
that
I may in fact be very well aware of a specific context in which various
supernatural accomplishments, including that of ?moving through space?,
are regularly thematized.
Indeed, it is difficult for Buddhologists not to be aware of the *bodhipakkhiy?
*
*dhamm?* and, as usual, Buddhagho?a is most entertaining when dealing with
the
*iddhip?da*s in *Visuddhimagga*, ch. 12. Often, he refers back to the
*iddhikath?*
chapter of the *Pa?isambhid?magga*, whereas my favourite concise overview
(with rather exhaustive references to canonical sources) still is Gethin?s
treatment of these *iddhip?da*s in his *The Buddhist Path to Awakening*.
For references to corresponding Sanskrit sources treating the *?ddhip?da*s,
one may still be benefitted by consulting Har Dayal?s old *Bodhisattva
Doctrine*,
pp. 104ff. and, of course, Lamotte?s *Trait?* III: 1124f.
Still, just as the notion of a *yogin* may be endowed with very different
connotations, depending on the textual and traditional context one looks
at,
the accomplishments of the *?k??ag?min *referred to by *siddh?c?rya*
A?vagho?a
may perhaps include, or overlap with, the success of those who practice
the *iddhip?da*s/*?ddhip?da*s, yet essentially differ (in terms of
practical details
and ultimate achievement) from the latter, just as a tantric context does
crucially
differ from a non-tantric one. Thus, though the horizon of what the
metaphor of
?moving through/within space? may entail is getting expanded, unfortunately
this does not immediately heighten the precision of determining *Vajras?c?*?s
authorship.
