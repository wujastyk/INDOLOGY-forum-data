Given that it originally was an m, my own practical solution to 
pronouncing the /anusv?ra ?/ is to simply speak an m, but without 
letting the lips touch each other. This can be practised by putting two 
fingers between them ? stopping before the teeth, of course ? and then 
trying to say "/sa?yoga/" or "/sa?s?ra/." You can think of the dot in /? 
/as the finger in this case, but in my experience, two fingers are needed.

Now this is only one way to pronounce it, but it's simple and working 
(tested with students also). Most importantly, it prevents one from 
speaking an actual m in words like "/sa?sk?ta/." I personally have the 
feeling that P??ini would have approved of it, but of course I do not 
have proof for this!
