Good point by Matthew. Hahn's edition is still available from the publisher:

http://www.iet-verlag.de/ser_iet20.html#i01

I have not seen Caube's edition. Possibly he used Hahn's edition. I have
posted only Tucci's edition, because Hahn's edition is still in print.

http://www.downloads.prajnaquest.fr/BookofDzyan/Sanskrit%20Buddhist%20Texts/ratnavali_1934-1936_partial.pdf

Tucci's edition of the parts then found was given by P. L. Vaidya in
Devanagari script as an appendix in his 1960 *Madhyamaka??stra of N?g?rjuna*.
This book was reprinted in 1987, but now the editor is stated as Shridhar
Tripathi rather than P. L. Vaidya. It is number 10 in the Buddhist Sanskrit
Texts series from Darbhanga.

In 1980 Siglinde Dietz published most of chapter 5 (in Latin script)
in the *Journal
of the Nepal Research Centre* (vol. 4), recovered from a manuscript not
used by Tucci. This manuscript also provided some corrections to the parts
published by Tucci. All of this material was fully used in Hahn's edition.
I attach the article by Dietz.

Lastly, the third chapter, which was entirely missing in both manuscripts,
was retranslated into Sanskrit by Losang Jamspal and published (in Latin
script) along with the edited Tibetan text in the festschrift to Robert
Thurman titled, *In Vimalak?rti's House*, 2015, pp. 289-313.
