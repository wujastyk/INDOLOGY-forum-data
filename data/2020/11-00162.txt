Dear Dominik

I would like to add my congratulations too - and my thanks to the colleagues on it who are always ready to help with the knottiest of indological queries. I don?t know what I would do without you all!

With very best wishes

Thank you, Adheesh, Philipp, Stefan and Wendy.  And thanks also to past members Audrey, Gary, John, Harunaga, Madhav, Christian, Birgit and Jan.  Without all your guidance and daily work, INDOLOGY wouldn't be what it is today.
