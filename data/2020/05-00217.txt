Enquiry on all four parts of etext Jayadrathayamala
Respected sir,
My name is Mangaldip Mukherjee. I live in India, west bengal. I am student
of literature here.But my most interests on Indian past cultures,tantra are
so immense that i study them very closely.
Sir, i found that you may know and have the all four parts of
jayadrathayamala. this made me so happy in heart because  for more than 4
months my research is based on saiva vidyapitha works. I studied
Brahmayamala and others with the text itself. But the problem  comes with
above mentioned work Jayadrathayamala, their are no editions of it.
Impossible to find in the internet, and all of a sudden i read that you
have all the four sataks. Sir this is hearted request to you, can you plzz
help me in my research and study and give me the four parts of Jayadratha
yamala in a readable format. If you have problem with this can you do
anything that will help me in this regard.
Hope you shall look into it, and do something for me.
Yours sincerely
Mangaldip mukherjee.
India, west bengal.
