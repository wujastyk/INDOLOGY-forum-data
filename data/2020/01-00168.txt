Dear colleagues,
Very briefly, and apologizing for not having followed as carefully as I should all the recent avat?ras of this thread... The Vajras?c? quotes these two verses (11-12) together and most explicitly ascribes them to Manu (m?navadharmapr?m??y?d api. ukta? hi m?nave dharme <stanzas 11-12> ato m?navadharmapr?m??y?j j?tis t?vad br?hma?o na bhavati.). Only the first can be traced in the Manusm?ti. It is MDh? 10.92: sadya? patati m??sena l?k?ay? lava?ena ca / tryah?c ch?dra? ca bhavati br?hma?a? k??ravikray? //. ?By selling meat, lac, or salt, a Brahmin falls immediately from his caste; by selling milk, he becomes a ??dra in three days.? (Translation P. Olivelle, Manu?s Law Code, OUP 2005, p. 212.) As for the second verse, it is the one we are interested in:?k??ag?mino vipr?? patanti m??sabhak?a??t / vipr???? patana? d???v? tato m??s?ni varjayet //. I must confess that everytime I read this verse I cannot help smiling/laughing. I am in fact very much inclined to see an ironic/sarcastic touch in it. Translating a bit freely, and in accordance with my feeling: ?Brahmins (vipra) who are [generally] flying in the air fall from eating meat; seing [how deep] the Brahmins have fallen, one should [certainly] refrain from [eating] meat.? The verse does not appear in the Manusm?ti and cannot be found in theY?j?avalkyasm?ti parallel either (3.40). Now of course, such irony ? if the verse is ironic at all ? is not really to be expected from orthodox Brahmanical treatises such as the Manusm?ti (or even a hypothetically lost M?navaDharmas?tra). Could it be a (Buddhist? Vajras?c??) forgery? It is certainly true that Buddhist philosophical treatises would normally not ascribe verses forged by their authors, or predecessors, to their opponents, Brahmanical or not ? how could this be taken seriously in the framework of philosophical/scientific controversy? But the Vajras?c? is by no means a philosopical treatise, and I am personally not ready to give it more weight than its poor argumentative strength deserves. Like most Buddhist tracts against the orthodox Brahmanical interpretation of the caste-classes, and especially against what the Buddhists almost unanimously regard as the Brahmins? ill-founded pride in caste/personal conceit, the Vajras?c? is itself very often ironic/sarcastic. This is of course just a feeling, and I would certainly be very happy to learn more about the origin/original context of this stanza, orthodox Brahmanical or not.
With best regards,
Vincent

Betreff: Re: [INDOLOGY] Vajras?c?
Dear Hartmut,
In his message to you, Prof. Schlingloff may have modestly omitted a reference to a publication of his that is in fact quite relevant in this regard:
D. Schlingloff, The Superhuman Faculties - Visual Meditation and Miracles in Buddhist Literature and Art, Buddhismus Studien 9.
In addition, it may or may not help to date and localise siddh?c?rya A?vagho?a, but could the "Siddha" part in his title point to a "southern" (not necessarily as south as Tamil Nadu, but up to around the Parvata mountain mentioned in the VP) and rasa??stric connection (alleged flying experiences through mercury)?
Jan Houben
N.B.
The itikartavyat? of the quotation may be clear: don't eat meat.
But what would the verse really express in its original context?
Or what type of  ?k??agamana is it referring to?
?k??ag?mino vipr?? patanti m??sabhak?a??t |
vipr???? patana? d???v? tato m??s?ni varjayet ||12||
"Due to consuming meat, the space-walking seers do fall (or fly, which is the older meaning of pat?).
Hence, observing the seers? fall (patana rather than p?ta refers rather to the actual falling, flying?) one should abandon meats."
Did these "seers" fall from the sky like Simon Magus after St Peter's prayer?
Were they first staying up in space, enjoyed some meat there just like Mary Poppins and Uncle Albert drinking tea at the ceiling of the living room, and did they fall down next?

Dear colleagues,
allow me to qualify my previous remark about ?having not yet met with
the notion of an ?k??ag?min in the various Buddhist philosophical contexts
elaborating their notions of m?rga ? ? ? in a beautifully suggestive manner,
Prof. Schlingloff rightly pointed out to me, being habitually forgetful, that
I may in fact be very well aware of a specific context in which various
supernatural accomplishments, including that of ?moving through space?,
are regularly thematized.
Indeed, it is difficult for Buddhologists not to be aware of the bodhipakkhiy?
dhamm? and, as usual, Buddhagho?a is most entertaining when dealing with the
iddhip?das in Visuddhimagga, ch. 12. Often, he refers back to the iddhikath?
chapter of the Pa?isambhid?magga, whereas my favourite concise overview
(with rather exhaustive references to canonical sources) still is Gethin?s
treatment of these iddhip?das in his The Buddhist Path to Awakening.
For references to corresponding Sanskrit sources treating the ?ddhip?das,
one may still be benefitted by consulting Har Dayal?s old Bodhisattva Doctrine,
pp. 104ff. and, of course, Lamotte?s Trait? III: 1124f.
Still, just as the notion of a yogin may be endowed with very different
connotations, depending on the textual and traditional context one looks at,
the accomplishments of the ?k??ag?min referred to by siddh?c?rya A?vagho?a
may perhaps include, or overlap with, the success of those who practice
the iddhip?das/?ddhip?das, yet essentially differ (in terms of practical details
and ultimate achievement) from the latter, just as a tantric context does crucially
differ from a non-tantric one. Thus, though the horizon of what the metaphor of
?moving through/within space? may entail is getting expanded, unfortunately
this does not immediately heighten the precision of determining Vajras?c??s
authorship.

I'd be hesitant in using terms like ?k??agamin to date a text unless there was an indication that it was part of a larger established doctrine. Those kinds of abilities were regularly mentioned.
The idea of sages moving through space is mentioned as early as Rig Veda X.136 although it uses different terminology.
In a forthcoming publication, I discuss how those types of experiences may be part of a body of experiences that are universal psychological responses to certain psychophysiological stimuli such as meditative practices, entraining to rhythmic chanting, drugs, etc. (See Yoga Sutras 4.1) I call it the yogic-shamanic continuum. Given that, using such experiences alone to date a text would probably be misleading.

Allow me to add a word of caution about chronology with respect to Manu. Even if Vajras?c? 12 explicitly refers to M?nava Dharma??stra 5.48, the Vasi??ha Dharmas?tra (4.7) does the same (being much closer to Manu's text). And yet, Olivelle considers theM?nava Dharma??stra "clearly posterior to Vasi??ha".
There are other cases which show that even literal quotations from and references to Manu do not necessarily prove that the text concerned is posterior to Manu. I discuss them in detail in the following article:

Dear Vincent,
Thank you for your further comments.
I didn?t mean to suggest that the yukta pram??a described in the Caraka Sa?hit? was the same as the dharm?rthayukta? vacana? pram??am of the Vajras?c?. Only that a pram??a explicitly based on yukta (however one parses that phrase) is something seen early on, and then it disappears. The yukta-pram??a of the Caraka is a fascinating thing whose loss probably was a loss for the entire Indian philosophical enterprise. Farmers and doctors shared a common concern, which is that to get from initial cause to actual fruition involves a process in time of multiple causes, with multiple stages, any of which can effect or nullify the outcome: planting a crop and being able to harvest; pregnancy making it to term; etc. Taking all relevant factors into account and calculating the probabilities of a successful final outcome was what yukta pram??a was designed to accomplish. In some ways, that is closer to the probabalistic reasoning that has displaced causal thinking in western philosophy (and some sciences) since the early 20th c than the more mechanistic cause and invariant effect reasoning more prevalent in Indian thought. Obviously, the Caraka?s yukta pram??a is not the same thing as drawing knowledge through discourse employing reasoning based on dharma and artha (or the meaning/purpose of dharma).
The idea of prototypical ideas that emerge later under the rubric of M?m??s? is intriguing. The Yog?c?rabh?mi is an often ignored treasure trove of ideas circulating in India earlier than is often recognized (as is the Tattvasiddhi, though not adequately captured in Sastri?s translations, in which many of the stock arguments repeated in pram??av?da texts are already found). Squeamishness about sacrifices is quite early ? Jains and even S??khyans express those ideas, and one can see some reaction against that even in the Bhagavad G?t? (whether one dates that to 200 BCE or 200 CE). Dign?ga does deal with M?m??s? in PS, for which there is no (available) Chinese translation. (There is a hint that a one fascicle translation was made, but no evidence of it aside from a mention of its title in a catalogue of translations).
The Chinese sources frequently cite a school by its founder?s name instead of the name of the school. Typically:
Kapila ???, the founder of S??khya ??; Ul?ka ??? (a.k.a. Ka??da ???), the founder of Vai?e?ika ???, and ??abha ???, the founder of the Nirgranthas.
As far as I can find, there is no Chinese version of Jaimini?s name. Again, I would be happy to learn otherwise.

Dear Dan,
My impression is that the Buddhists became aware of M?m??s? as a distinct religio-philosophical school (and not just as a purely intra-Brahmanical type of ?theological/exegetical? inquiry) some time during the fourth century CE (or perhaps in the early fifth), even though the term may not occur, at least not regularly, before Dign?ga (480-540). It is also around the fourth century CE that certain Buddhists started arguing against ideas that are close to those known to us from later M?m??saka sources (e.g., on sacrificial violence, the caste-classes, etc.), even though several among these ideas find interesting prototypes in the M?navadharma??stra. This is especially the case in the so-called parav?da section of the Yog?c?rabh?mi. Hundreds of pages could be written on these topics.
The stanza you quote is arguably the most important in the Vajras?c?, for it spells out the philosophical-polemical program of the entire work. A rough translation might be: ?The Vedas are authoritative (pram??a); the Sm?tis are authoritative; [any] speech/discourse endowed/connected (yukta) with dharma and artha is authoritative. A [person] for whom a [previously acknowledged] pram??a would cease (na bhavet) to be a pram??a [because it contradicts his/her position on the issue of the caste-classes], who [on earth] would take his/her speech/discourse to be a pram??a/authoritative?? One can certainly discuss the exact structure and meaning of the compound dharm?rthayukta, but seriously doubt that yukta here has anything to do with the pram??a the medical tradition refers to as yukti (see articles by Filliozat, Steinkellner, and others). Or did I miss the point?
I entirely agree with you as regards S??khya and Vai?e?ika: from the 1st-2nd to the 5th century, these traditions/schools are the most frequent targets of the Buddhist controversialists. The Ny?ya (works by [the pseudo?]N?g?rjuna) and the M?m??s? play a comparatively minor role, as do the Jains (targeted as early as ?ryadeva?s Catu??ataka, and more frequently from the Yog?c?rabh?mi onwards).

Betreff: Re: [INDOLOGY] Vajras?c?
Dear all,
Just to comment quickly, though I haven?t studied the Vajras?c? in any depth, the same passage that Vincent highlighted, naming the Vedas, Grammarians, et al. is also the one that caught my attention, especially the mention of M?m??sikas. As far as I can tell, while the others do get mentioned in Chinese translations of Buddhist texts, the only text preserved in Chinese that mentions M?m??sikas is Xuanzang?s translation of Bh?viveka?s Praj??prad?pa, which mentions them twice in close proximity:
????????13?22 ????????????????????????[1]????????????????????????(CBETA, T30, no. 1566, p. 119, b15-17)
[1]???????
[1]???????
?Again there are the non-Buddhist (t?rthika) M?m?msikas who say: ?What is said by Buddhists In the twelve divisions of the their s?tras (canon), is that no person is omniscient, because they are conditioned (sa?sk?ra), just as is stated in treatises by the Vai?e?ikas, and so on.?
????????13?22 ??????????????????????(CBETA, T30, no. 1566, p. 119, c5-6)
?This like the non-Buddhist M?m?msikas who imagine that the Word of the Vedas is eternal.?
I have found no other mention of M?m??s? in any other Chinese sources (if anyone has information on discussions I might have missed, please let me know). Bh?viveka, of course, devoted an entire chapter in his Madhyamakah?daya to M?m??s?, but his description of their doctrines suggests they differed in several ways from the versions we are more familiar with post Pr?bh?kara and Kum?rila. It is the latter?s ?lokavarttika, of course, that made M?m??s? hard to ignore for subsequent Buddhists.
Harivarman?s Tattvasiddhi (translated by Kum?raj?va at the beginning of the 5th c) identifies (among others) Vai?e?ika, S??khya, Ny?ya, and Jains as p?rvapak?ins. More generally in Buddhist literature preserved in Chinese prior to the middle of the seventh century, the most commonly cited opponents are Vai?e?ika and S??khya. Ny?ya is mentioned infrequently, as are Jains.
As for the pram??a issue mentioned by Matthew, the Vajras?r? verse identifies what serve as authorities for non-Buddhists (the following verse turns to lineage):
ved?? pram??a? sm?taya? pram??a? dharm?rthayukta? vacana? pram??am |
yasya pram??a? na bhavetpram??a? kastasya kury?dvacana? pram??am || 2 ||
Which are more or less equivalent to ?ruti, sm?ti, and ?pti-pram??a, and analogous to ?scripture and reason? (?gama, yukti) that was the established criteria for validity for Buddhists, even into the pram??av?da era. And, as I wrote elsewhere:
"Prama?n?a-theory rst appears in the eleventh chapter of the first part (Su?tra-stha?na) of the CS [Caraka-sa?hit?]. Here the CS intriguingly proposes, along with the three prama?n?as one would expect (perception, inference, and authori- tative testimony), a fourth not found anywhere else: synthetic inductive reasoning (yukta-prama?n?a). Discussion of prama?n?a occurs in two other parts of the CS: part 3, Vima?na-stha?na, chap. 4 and chap. 8, but the unique yukta-prama?n?a is absent from those discussions, a sign of the strati ed nature of the text.?
So a yukta pram??a suggest to me a possibly early date for that category.
Has anyone considered whether it is possible that the verses may have been written by A?vagho?a or someone relatively early while the prose exposition may have been added by a later hand?

Dear Matthew,
I was referring to most of the elements of the list I quoted, of course, not to the entire Vajras?c?. But you are right, Matthew: the Mah?bh?rata plays an important role in the Vajras?c?, as does? Manu ? which may be the reason for Patrick?s query. It is well known that the Vajras?c? attributes several verses to Manu that cannot be traced in the extant M?navadharma??stra (if I remember well, this is the reason why some scholars tentatively attributed them to a lost M?nava Dharmas?tra). Whatever the case may be, we might perhaps agree that the Vajras?c? is unlikely to have been composed before the 3rd-4th century CE. I am inclined to believe that it is even younger.

Betreff: Re: Vajras?c?
Not wishing to differ with my learned colleague Vincent Eltschinger's remarks (which are surely based on a deeper engagement with this corpus than my own), I tend nevertheless to think it not quite plausible that "most of its individual elements could have been known around 100 CE."
My sense is that the several epic and puranic parallels point to a somewhat later period.

AW: Vajras?c?
Dear Patrick,
As you know, A?vagho?a directed some arguments against the Brahmanical understanding of the caste-classes in one of his dramas, the ??riputraprakara?a/?aradvat?putraprakara?a, several fragments of which have been preserved in Central Asian manuscripts and edited by Heinrich L?ders around 1910. It is thus plausible that A?vagho?a dedicated an individual treatise to this topic. The style, the method and the philosophical ressources of the Vajras?c?, however, are very different from the ones we know from A?vagho?a?s genuine works, and may presuppose Buddhist works such as the ??rd?lakar??vad?na if not Kum?ral?ta?s Kalpan?ma??itik? D????ntapa?kti?. Even if I am not aware of any convincing argument against the attribution of the Vajras?c? to A?vagho?a, I have always regarded the following statement as anachronistic: d??yante ca kvacic ch?dr? api vedavy?kara?am?m??s?s??khyavai?e?ikanagn?*j?vik?disarva??str?rthavida? /. ?And one observes in some cases that even ??dras know the meaning of all ??stras such as the Veda, Grammar, M?m??s?, S??khya, Vai?e?ika as well as [those of] the Jainas and the ?j?vikas.? (*-nagn?- em. : lagn?- Ed.) Although such a list is not per se impossible in A?vagho?a?s time, i.e., although most of its individual elements could have been known around 100 CE, I do not believe that such an enumeration would have been possible, as a doxographic statement, at that time, and even less so under A?vagho?a's "pen." (The absence of the Ny?ya from the list is intriguing.)
Another element possibly deserving some consideration is the Sanskrit colophon in which A?vagho?a is characterized as siddh?c?rya (k?tir iya? siddh?c?ry??vagho?ap?d?n?m iti), an expression the exact meaning of which remains somewhat unclear to me.
I am looking forward to reading other opinions on this interesting topic.
Very best,
Vincent

Dear Patrick,
You'll find some discussion of it, inter alia, in Vincent Eltschinger, "Caste" et Philosophie Bouddhique WSTB 47 (2000). As you no doubt know, the Chinese translation is late - 10th c. if I recall correctly - and is attributed to DharmakIrti. I rather doubt that the true authorship can be established, given the available evidence. The emphasis on pramANa seems to suggest that it was written during the second half of the first millennium, not much before. But the way in which pramANa is used there does not resonate closely with the Buddhist pramANa school. The precise milieu in which it was composed remains a puzzle (at least to me!).
all best,
Matthew

Does anyone know of newer work on the identity and date of the author of Vajras?c?, often ascribed to A?vagho?a? Any new ideas on its possible date? With thanks and best wishes,
