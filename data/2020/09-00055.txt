Dear Herman,
Have you looked at the discussion of Tamil Brahmi inscriptions in K. Rajan?s ?Early Writing System: A Journey from Graffiti to Brahmi?, Pandya Nadu Centre for Historical Research, Madurai, 2015? See pp. 404-405. Table 8.2 on p. 407 has six pot sherds with Tamil Brahmi dated between 4th to 6th century BCE.
Rajan states on p. 400, ?The close observations of Dami?i (Tami?-Br?hm?) and Sri Lankan Br?hm? (Prakrit-Br?hm?) suggest they had close relations with each other in terms of paleography, probably due to geographical proximity, than the A?okan-Br?hm?.?

[INDOLOGY] Br?hm? in Sri Lanka
Dear List members,
In "Pasage to India? Anuradhapura and the Early Use of the Brahmi Script" (Cambridge Archaeological Journal 6/1 (1996), pp. 73-97) Coningham et al. conclude that the Br?hm? script was used on Sri Lanka by traders at least a century earlier than in "India" by A?oka. His dating of the inscribed pottery shreds in question is based on the radiocarbon method. In fact, a large part of the article is dedicated to a discussion of this method. What I would like to know is if there has been a reaction to Coningham's conclusions. Salomon (1998) does not discuss them and von Hin?ber (1990) and Falk (1993) could not.
