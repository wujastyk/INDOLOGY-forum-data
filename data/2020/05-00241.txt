[INDOLOGY] looking for horses
Dear colleagues,
I am looking for a book chapter that I am hoping someone might have digitized. It is the following:
Leshnik, Lawrence S. ?The Horse in India.? In Symbols, Subsistence and Social Structure: The Ecology of Man and Animal in South Asia, edited by Franklin C. Southworth. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania, South Asia Regional Studies, 1977-78.
I am also wondering if anyone knows of research focused on the horse, Uccai??ravas, that emerged from the churning of the ocean.
With best wishes,
