Sanskrit is often seen as a self-referential tradition that looks only to itself, but often it is forgotten that almost from its Paninean beginnings, Sanskrit (as opposed to Vedic Sanskrit) has been in symbiosis with other languages that were spoken natively by the people who used it. Sanskrit words were borrowed into other languages as tadbhavas or the like, and in common speech, they acquired connotations and even meanings that they do not have in Sanskrit (k?a?i- means ?invite? in Malayalam). When people speaking those languages wrote in Sanskrit, they no doubt transferred the acquired connotations back into Sanskrit, and in this way Sanskrit, held rigid by the rules of the grammarians, still acquired new connotations and even meanings. At the same time, in spite of this, Sanskrit words for the most part did not have the breadth of connotation and emotion that words of a spoken language have. Years ago, Ingalls pointed out that Sanskrit, unlike natural languages, has perfect synonyms. Still, I think it is wrong to think of Sanskrit as self-referential and unchanging. I remember years ago attending a bharatan??ya performance which the dancer began with a rather stiff Sanskrit ?loka, followed by a padam by the great Telugu writer Kshatrayya in which a woman, speaking to her lover, says, ?v?stavam??? ?is it true?? and the whole sequence drips with emotion, catalyzed by that one word. ?V?stavam? is used in South Indian languages, and it has a plethora of connotations. If a Telugu writes a Sanskrit verse and uses that word, he/she will certainly bring its Telugu connotations into Sanskrit. In any event, I think Sanskrit is a language that has constantly changed and evolved, with its evolution catalyzed by its symbiosis with other languages. Even in Sanskrit, the meanings of words change. George Hart
