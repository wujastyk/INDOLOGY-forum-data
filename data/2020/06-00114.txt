[INDOLOGY] Monier-Williams and Spoken Sanskrit
One of my students, Alex Watt, found this interesting passage in MMW's 'Modern India and the Indians' (1878), p.38
"... a deputation of Br?hmans is seen approaching. They have come to greet me on my arrival; some of them are Pandits. A mat is spread for them in a vacant tent. They enter without shoes, make respectful salaams and squat around me in a semi-circle. I thoughtlessly shake hands with the chief Pandit, a dignified venerable old gentleman, forgetful that the touch of a Mleccha (English barbarian) will entail upon him laborious purificatory ceremonies on his return to his own house. We then exchange compliments in Sansk?it and I ask them many questions, and propound difficulties for discussion. Their fluency in talking Sansk?it surprises me, and certainly surpasses mine. We English scholars treat Sansk?it as a dead language, but here in India I am expected to speak it as if it were my mother-tongue. Once or twice I find myself floundering disastrously, but the polite Pandits help me out of my difficulties..."
