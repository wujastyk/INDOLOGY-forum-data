[INDOLOGY] A distraction from the Coronavirus
Dear Professor Houben
I am overjoyed to read your reply.You have presented a great deal of
grammatical materials in order to derive "yaaji". Only Panini 3.3.110
resolves this problem which was not in my memory.Yaaji is in the sense of
sacrifice and is also conducive to the popular usage.Acc. to Unadi rule
"vasi vapi" quoted in the Siddhanta Kaumudi it conveys the sense of a
karta( agent)which is not required in the said context.
