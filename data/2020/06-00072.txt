Dear Friends,

In its entry on Johannes Hertel, Iranicaonline refers to the following:
Frank Neubert, ?German Indology, Aryan Studies and Anti-Semitism: The Case
of Johannes Hertel,? in *Comparative Studies of South Asia, Africa and the
Middle East*, vol. III, 2003 (forthcoming).

Whatever happened to this piece, it did not appear in this journal (despite
it having been cited at least once as if it did, itself interesting...).
Was it ever published?

Jonathan
