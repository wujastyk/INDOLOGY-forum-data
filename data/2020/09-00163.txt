Dear Madhav,

I had the same frustrating problem until a colleague advised me to update my version of Word for Mac.  I changed from version 14.6.6 to version 16.41, and now everything works fine.  Although it?s still Microsoft.

Yours,
Gary.

I don't use LaTeX, and have used MicroSoft Word for Devanagari in the past.  However, for some reason, while Word for Windows supports the use of Unicode Devanagari, Word for Mac OS does not support typing Unicode Devanagari. So I am left to work with OpenOffice and LibreOffice.  I am now thinking of installing Windows on my MacBook and see if I can work with Word for Windows on my MacBook.  I would appreciate to hear the experiences of Mac users with Unicode Devanagari. Best wishes,

I like and use Somdev Vasudev's Romdev myself, for telling XeTeX how to turn IAST encoding into Devanagari.  It does a great job.

But don't get it from the indology archive.  Go to Github.  I haven't checked, but I am pretty sure the Github version is more up-to-date:

  *   https://github.com/somadeva/RomDev

The only thing is, you have to download it and install it.  That's quite easy, if you know your computer well and love reading documentation (Mmmm).  But the standard TeX distribution, TeXlive, has a ready-made IAST translator already pre-installed, called, er, iast.  So one can say

Mapping=iast,

and it just works.  No installation necessary.  This iast translator, and the velthuis one and a Harvard-Kyoto one, we owe to the kindness of Daniel Stender.

  *   https://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/xetex/generic/devanagari?lang=en

But this link is only for interest; it's already installed on all systems that use TeXlive, so there's no need to fetch it.

Best,
Dominik

Dear Tim,

You can use RomDev available at https://indology.info/etexts/archive/soft/ and MacTex/TexLive mentioned in Dominik?s posting. I have been using these on a Mac since 2013, when I could not coax MacDevnag and TexLive to produce texts longer than 2 or 3 pages. I also found articles at https://cikitsa.blogspot.com<https://cikitsa.blogspot.com/> (Dominik?s site).

Best,

Elliot

Dear TeXies on the list,

My university is pushing me to update my Mac OS to Catalina, which cannot run 32-bit applications.  I am still using MacDevnag as a preprocessor to generate Devanagari output from my LaTeX files.  I am going to appease them for now by upgrading to Mojave, which can run 32-bit (yes, I am an update laggard, still running [Low] Sierra!), but that is inevitably just a temporary fix.  I confess to being only semi-literate in LaTeX and XeLaTeX, so I may have missed a crucial new development.

So far as I can see from
https://bdesgraupes.pagesperso-orange.fr/sanskrit.html
 https://bdesgraupes.pagesperso-orange.fr/DocHTML/MacDevnagHelp/index.html
there is no 64-bit version, and likely never will be.

Those of you who are au courant, how should I be dealing with this problem.  Due to laggardliness, I am still finalizing a volume using MacDevnag and am reluctant to attempt to reconfigure things altogether at this late stage in the process.

With fingers crossed,
Tim
