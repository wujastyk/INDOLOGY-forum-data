=?utf-8?Q?[INDOLOGY]_bind,_n=C4=81da_and_vocal_music?=
Dear Indologists,
There is a Tamil verse that talks about different actions involved in the production of vocal music. Interestingly, the first two involve bindu and n?da. ?According to a modern commentator, bindu has to rotate to produce the n?da. He seems to suggest the Mata?ga ?gama might have information about this. I would appreciate any references on any ?gama or ?aiva ?iddh?nta texts (along with their dates) that deal with the production of n?da from bindu. 
Thank you.
Regards,
Palaniappan ?
