Subject: [INDOLOGY] Lead cubes with Indic numeration found in Thames River

The grids on the sides of the cubes are indeed magic squares. Every row 
of numbers, whether read orthogonally or diagonally, adds up to 36, 
which identify the magic squares as associated with R?hu. This is also 
borne out by the inscriptions at the bottom which read: "aum r?have 
nama?".

A quick search online reveals several reports of circular and triangular 
tokens with magic squares of either R?hu or Ketu turning up in rivers in 
England, America, Canada, and New Zealand. E.g.:

http://www.treasurenet.com/forums/what/286825-lead-elephant-coins-lead-bull-squares.html

A poster on the latter forum states that: "I saw this a few summers ago 
in St. Louis MO. There was a whole family beside the river and two were 
throwing these type coins in and a few other items. Didn't ask anything 
as you could tell they were trying to keep it private."

I did not find any reports about cubes, but the circular tokens can, for 
instance, be bought here:

I wonder if it would be considered inauspicious to pick them up, or 
whether they would already have served their ritual purpose (whatever 
exactly that might have been)?

Best,
Jacob
