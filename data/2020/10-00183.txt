Dear List Members,

Thank you all who have responded to my query about Manusmriti. I really appreciate your help in understanding a passage in Manusmriti. Thank you all!


Dear Tyler W,

I have not missed reading any of the responses related to my posting about Manusmriti. 

I am least interested in politicizing any text. My query was naive, just wanting to know if there was any reference in Manusmriti to describing women as ?prostitutes."

[I am 78+ years old; my students and colleagues and friends on this list would know whether I am political.
If only Professor Ludo Rocher is alive today ? I would have asked him personally about this text. I miss him now more than ever.]

I gave some background information about how this text, Manusmriti, is understood positively or negatively, as a reason for my query. That?s it.

Please don?t take it beyond that. 

Thanks and Regards,
V.S.Rajam

If you are criticizing Dalit rights and women?s rights movements and their critiques of the Manusmriti in your post, let me take this opportunity to kindly remind you that this is an academic and scholarly forum and as such casteism, sexism, and communalism have no place here.

People who hate brahmins use Manusmriti and similar texts as their tools in their politics. I wonder how many of them could read these original texts in Sanskrit. Depending upon the translations, everyone?s understanding and interpretation may vary. It is truly a sad scene.

>>> The context at the beginning of Chapter 9 is the law or duties between a man and wife. However, the misogyny of the text is unmistakeable (though hardly out of line with nearly all texts in antiquity) and 9.14-15 seem to (mis-)characterize females generally. However, I would add is that pau??calya here denotes lust or an innate sexual desire for men. While it may sometimes refer to a prostitute, the primary meaning of ?prostitute? (at least in American English) is one who has sex in exchange for money. Granted, there are other meanings, but the money piece matters, I think, because the condemnation in Manu is about women?s temptations and attributed inclinations toward adultery, not prostitution in a strict sense. The passage is exhorting husbands to control their wives (or, more deviously, keep women hyper-occupied, 9.10-12) in order to prevent their adultery. It then justifies this control on the false grounds of women?s innate lechery, fickleness, and general inconstancy.

>>> The question might be asked whether the English distinction of adultery and prostitution maps on precisely and consistently to Sanskrit terms, but it would seem important to keep the two distinct at the outset.
