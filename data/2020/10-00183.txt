[INDOLOGY] Manusmriti ... (Olivelle, J P)
Dear List Members,
Thank you all who have responded to my query about Manusmriti. I really appreciate your help in understanding a passage in Manusmriti. Thank you all!
Dear Tyler W,
I have not missed reading any of the responses related to my posting about Manusmriti. 
I am least interested in politicizing any text. My query was naive, just wanting to know if there was any reference in Manusmriti to describing women as ?prostitutes."
[I am 78+ years old; my students and colleagues and friends on this list would know whether I am political.
If only Professor Ludo Rocher is alive today ? I would have asked him personally about this text. I miss him now more than ever.]
I gave some background information about how this text, Manusmriti, is understood positively or negatively, as a reason for my query. That?s it.
Please don?t take it beyond that. 
Thanks and Regards,
V.S.Rajam
