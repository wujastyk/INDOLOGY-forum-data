Dear colleagues,


With apologies for the self-promotion -- but hoping to do right by a wonderful press that generously poured so many of its own resources into it -- I am pleased to announce the publication of my book, Translating Wisdom: Hindu-Muslim Intellectual Interactions in Early Modern South Asia (University of California Press). I am grateful that UC Press has made the book widely accessible through a free open-access download (link below), with print copies also available in paperback.

With many thanks,

Translating Wisdom: Hindu-Muslim Intellectual Interactions in Early Modern South Asia



During the height of Muslim power in Mughal South Asia, Hindu and Muslim scholars worked collaboratively to translate a large body of Hindu Sanskrit texts into the Persian language. Translating Wisdom reconstructs the intellectual processes and exchanges that underlay these translations. Using as a case study the 1597 Persian rendition of the Laghu-Yoga-V?si??ha?an influential Sanskrit philosophical tale whose popularity stretched across the subcontinent?Shankar Nair illustrates how these early modern Muslim and Hindu scholars drew upon their respective religious, philosophical, and literary traditions to forge a common vocabulary through which to understand one another. These scholars thus achieved, Nair argues, a nuanced cultural exchange and interreligious and cross-philosophical dialogue significant not only to South Asia?s past but also its present.
