[INDOLOGY] Scans of David Pingree's Census of the Exact Sciences in Sanskrit
I would also like to draw attention to high-quality scans of the five
volumes of CESS published during David's lifetime that have been done by
the U. of Alberta Digital Initiatives in collaboration with Archive.org.
Copyright permission to make these scans was granted by their publisher,
the American Philosophical Society.
