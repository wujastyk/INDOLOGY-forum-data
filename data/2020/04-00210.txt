(I tried to take only one shloka and sing, but it was difficult; hence samples are a little varying.) And one more limitation is that I belong to South India, so lot of North is missed! And just now it struck- are there any NRI tunes/videshi tunes?

> Thanks to the questioner! His question opened doors into new area of thinking for me. I realized while working on this, that I am totally unaware of tunes which are Bengali, Oriya, Gujarati, Kashmiri, Himachal Pradesh etc. and many more sources might be there. I also wrote a small write-up with my limited knowledge- which I just copy pasted below. Much can be added to make it complete. Eg. how to people get to some tune? How do they originate? Actually get propagated?

Let me have any more information upon this subject, and please let me know if such an endeavour has been made before by anyone- please provide the links and names and if possible, the work also. Further light on classification could also help. Any aspect of this area would be helpful in increasing my knowledge.

>             Tunes can be divided into ? 1. Traditional tunes 2. Tunes developed by individuals. Then one more classification is like- 1. For recitation 2. For chanting. Most of the times the classical music element involved in shlokas, long drawn musical notes,  is only for beautification and mostly avoided by general people.
