[INDOLOGY] David W. McAlpin
Dear Deshpandeji,
I had corresponded with him when I was working on my chapter on the
Dravidian Languages for Mouton publishers. The last correspondence was
about two years ago in 2017 Dec when we exchanged holiday greetings.
Franklin C. Southworth may have a more recent contact.
Thanks,
Suresh.
