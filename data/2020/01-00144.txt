Dear Dan,
In his commentary on the *?ataka??stra, a part of ?ryadeva?s 
Catu??ataka??stra, Ji-zang (??) enumerates not only the four Vedas (??) 
but also all of the eighteen (??) abodes of knowledge, vidy?sth?nas 
(??), with brief definitions of each (Taish? Tripi?aka, vol. 42, 
251a20?b8). Ji-zang?s list of vidy?sth?nas is partly different from that 
which appears in Brahmanical literature because it includes S??khya and 
Yoga, but M?m??s? is included in it with written errors as ???, which 
must be ???.
This was pointed out by Hakuju Ui (????) in pp. 463?467 of the notes on 
his translation of Madhus?dana?s Prasth?nabheda: ?Various routes? 
(Shuju-naru michi)???????, Studies of Indian 
Philosophy????????4, pp. 425?575, Tokyo: Iwanami shoten, 1927.
Ui maintains that Ji-zang may have received this information about the 
eighteen vidy?sth?nas from Param?rtha (499?569) because according to 
Ji-zan?s biography he was very close to Param?rtha.
