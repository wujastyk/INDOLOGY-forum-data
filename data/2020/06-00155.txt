[INDOLOGY] South-East Asian manuscripts
Dear Christophe,
as for the first one (E1452), it may very well be Balinese, but to me, the script looks more like Javanese. Actually, the manuscript might be from Lombok, where the Sasak community use their own form of Javanese-derived script. I have seen several manuscripts from Lombok carrying elaborately carved thick wooden covers, such as the one in the picture.
Best,
Andrea
