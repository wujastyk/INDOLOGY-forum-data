Dear Madhav,
Could borrowing back from the vernacular perhaps be part of Sanskrit being,
or having been in former centuries, a living language?
As for the perfect formation: one could think of the optionality (or
anityat?) of ?iC as the real underlying issue, and this was already
discussed before Vopadeva by
M?dhava, who refers to even earlier discussions such as the one occasioned
by the K??ik?v?tti citing jaga?atu? jaga?u? (although from root ga? in the
cur?di ga?a) as counterexamples under ata ekahal-...: here
Bodhisattvade??y?c?rya-Jinendrabuddhi is more ready to accept the KV's
examples than Vidvadvara-Haradattami?ra (both refer nevertheless to a ny?ya
'anitya?yant?? cur?daya?').
Could this difference further point to a *diglossic divergence* within the
Sanskrit tradition going back to the divergence between, on one side, the
KV of broader ("popular") orientation (followed by Jinendrabuddhi,
Vopadeva, Melputtur Narayana, the modern M?dhava) and, on the other side,
the Bh??ya of ?i??a-elite orientation (followed by Haradatta, Kaiya?a, the
old M?dhava, i.e., M?dhava-S?ya?a ...)?
With best wishes,
Jan
