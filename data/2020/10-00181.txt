=?utf-8?Q?Re:_[INDOLOGY]_root_skr=CC=A5=3F?=
Thanks, Hans.  Indeed, that is the sort of difference I am noticing here.
Without a comment, ??kalya renders the *askr?ta *of the Sa?hit? to *akr?ta *in
the Padap??ha.  This has both historical and theoretical implications.
Since we don't have ??kalya's grammar with us, P??ini shows what synchronic
grammarians might do with such things.  But for this specific example, I
don't remember seeing a particular rule in P??ini that would take us
from *akr?ta
*of the Padap??ha to *askr?ta* of the Sa?hit? with augmentation of the root
with "*s*".  The closest I find is P.6.1.136, which says that the augment "
*s*" can be attached even when there is intervention by the past tense
marker "*a*" or reduplication of the root. The example of the first is
*sam-a-s-karot*. In RV we have 10.127.03a  *n?r u sv?s?ram **askr?ta*, though
the pre-verb/preposition *nis/nir *is separated from the verb *askr?ta*, it
is the intended combination *nir-a-s-kr?ta* or the base verbal combination
*ni?karoti/ni?kurute* that explains the "s" in this form.  Perhaps a good
example of "s-mobile".
