Dear List members,

regarding rendition of sam?skr?ta- to sanskr?ta-, to my knowledge this
is not considered to be accepted in the higher register, or is it
described as such anywhere? This might simply be a result of
contamination from the vernacular, lower register, into the higher one,
due to classic phonotactical assimilation during the natural
articulation process, so ?the nasal is put in the same phonetic
category?, as George said. 

On the contrary, renditions of sam?skr?ta- (where anusva?ra ? as usual
behaving rather like a simple nasal placeholder ? inevitably is prone to
assimilation) or sam?skr?ta- might rather just be allophones (and
consequently allographs) in differently standardized languages and/or
dialects. 

And samskr?ta-, afaik, would be an outrageous violation of articulatory
norms and practice in the higher registers of Vedic Sanskrit as well as
Epic-Classical Sanskrit. 

I guess, the same holds true for sim?ha- to simha- (?!), where the
assimilation of anusva?ra to the velar nasal seems to be common.

Best,


Raik Strunz

     Given that it originally was an m, my own practical solution to    
  pronouncing the anusv?ra ? is to simply speak an m, but       without
letting the lips touch each other. This can be practised       by
putting two fingers between them ? stopping before the teeth,       of
course ? and then trying to say "sa?yoga" or "sa?s?ra."       You can
think of the dot in ? as the finger in this case,       but in my
experience, two fingers are needed. 
     
     Now this is only one way to pronounce it, but it's simple and      
working (tested with students also). Most importantly, it prevents      
one from speaking an actual m in words like "sa?sk?ta." I      
personally have the feeling that P??ini would have approved of it,      
but of course I do not have proof for this!

                    Dear George,             
                            As per P??ini's rules, a word-final m changes         
     to anusv?ra before any consonant [mo                 'nusv?ra?,
hali].  Then come option rules.  Before y/v/l,               an anusv?ra
can optionally change to nasal               versions of y/v/l.  Before
the stops, it can               optionally change to a nasal homogeneous
with               the following stop [parasavar?a].  This leaves
r/?/?/s/h,               and before these it remains anusv?ra.  In
some               Vedic traditions, in this last environment, it
becomes n?sikya               or ra?ga.  Then there are rules which
change n into               an anusv?ra in some environments.  This is
the               general description according to P??ini.  Some other  
            grammars do allow an m occurring at the end of an           
   occurrence before a pause to change into anusv?ra,              
reflecting some local variation.  Of course, the actual              
pronunciation of an anusv?ra probably differed               regionally
as we notice today, and different Vedic               traditions have
conventionally settled ways of its               pronunciation.  Also
rules that are optional in P??ini               don't necessarily remain
optional in various Vedic               tradition.  In most Vedic
recitations I have heard, the               change of an anusv?ra into a
parasavar?a nasal               is almost done invariably.

             I?ve been enjoying the               discussion on
Indology. A friend had a question about               Sanskrit that I
could not answer properly. It involves the               pronunciation
of anusv?ra before various consonants. I               believe that
before y, r, l and v, it is nasalized.               Assuming that is
correct, is it also nasalized before ?,               ?, s and h? Some
people say samsk?ta, with an m sound, but               I always assumed
it was a nasal sound. I think the nasal               is put in the same
phonetic category as the ? etc. ? i.e.in a??a it is a palatal           
   nasal, in sa?sk?ta it is a dental nasal, and in si?ha it             
 is sort of a velar nasal sound. The problem is, everyone              
seems to say simha (m sound), not the nasal sound. What do              
the grammarians say? Is there a correct pronunciation, or              
can one choose between the nasal and the ?m? before ?, ?,
