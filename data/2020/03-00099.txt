Vi?nja Grabovac gave an interesting talk connected to this topic at last
year's International Vedic Workshop: "Notes on Indra or ?akra in
Buddhist texts" 

Here's the abstract from the Programme
(http://www.iuc.hr/IucAdmin/Server/downloads/7IVWProgrammeandAbstracts.pdf):


"Indra, one of the most prominent Vedic deities, is found in Buddhist
texts as well. Commonly known as Sakka in P?li and ?akra in Sanskrit
Buddhist texts, this deity exhibits some different qualities than ones
attributed to him in Vedic or later Brahmanical texts, though there are
other features that clearly connect Indra and Buddhist Sakka/ ?akra. On
the whole, the role of Indra or ?akra in Buddhism bears witness to the
stage in the history of Hinduism in which new cults of Vi??u and ?iva
did not as yet overshadow the cult of Indra, just as is the case in the
older layers of the Sanskrit epics too, and it is still a form of the
Vedic religion that Buddhism is addressing as its counterpart. With the
focus on the mah?vastu, a work preserved in Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit and
belonging to Lokottarav?da subsect of the mah?s??ghikas, the intention
of the paper will be to present the role of ?akra in the biographical
episodes of gautama Buddha and contained j?takas, to isolate his
epithets, and to highlight some instances which complicate the
understanding of the relationship between Indra and ?akra in the
mah?vastu." 

Best, 

D. Haas

> The trend seems to be, according to those sources, a domestication of Sakka from the fearsome Indra, slayer of the dragon V?tra in the ?g Veda, to a docile devotee of the Buddha. However, Buddhaghosa identified Sakka with Vajrap??i, the fearsome protector of the Dharma, who pummels those who threaten or bad-mouth the Dharma. So apparently even as late as Buddhaghosa's day (ca. 5th c CE), the 'terrible' form of Indra was still resonant with how Buddhists viewed Sakka/?akra.

>> the Sambul?-J?taka (519) is illustrated at a monastery Sri Lanka. Sambul? takes care of her leprosy husband Sotthisena in the forest. A demon falls in love and tries to catch her but ?akra rescues her.  The corresponding mural depicts ?akra as a terrible being holding a club in his hands. The Pali J?taka provides no description of a disguised ?akra but in the Sinhalese Sambul?-J?taka we can read, that ?akra saves Sambul? in the disguise of a terrible being (..._Sakdevraja bhay?naka v??ayak ge?a_ ...). I suppose this is recorded in a source of the M?lasarv?stiv?da-Vinaya tradition, written in Sanskrit or Tibetan.
