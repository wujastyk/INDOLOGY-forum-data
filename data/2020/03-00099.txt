Vi?nja Grabovac gave an interesting talk connected to this topic at last
year's International Vedic Workshop: "Notes on Indra or ?akra in
Buddhist texts" 
Here's the abstract from the Programme
(http://www.iuc.hr/IucAdmin/Server/downloads/7IVWProgrammeandAbstracts.pdf):
"Indra, one of the most prominent Vedic deities, is found in Buddhist
texts as well. Commonly known as Sakka in P?li and ?akra in Sanskrit
Buddhist texts, this deity exhibits some different qualities than ones
attributed to him in Vedic or later Brahmanical texts, though there are
other features that clearly connect Indra and Buddhist Sakka/ ?akra. On
the whole, the role of Indra or ?akra in Buddhism bears witness to the
stage in the history of Hinduism in which new cults of Vi??u and ?iva
did not as yet overshadow the cult of Indra, just as is the case in the
older layers of the Sanskrit epics too, and it is still a form of the
Vedic religion that Buddhism is addressing as its counterpart. With the
focus on the mah?vastu, a work preserved in Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit and
belonging to Lokottarav?da subsect of the mah?s??ghikas, the intention
of the paper will be to present the role of ?akra in the biographical
episodes of gautama Buddha and contained j?takas, to isolate his
epithets, and to highlight some instances which complicate the
understanding of the relationship between Indra and ?akra in the
mah?vastu."
