Subject: [INDOLOGY] diacritical marks on Mac

Hi Matthew,

   The ?Favorites? tab in keyboard preferences still exists, but it is not displayed until you add characters to it. 
   In the ?Show Character Viewer? option under the keyboard menu (now called ?Show Emoji & Symbols?), select a character.  In the right side details window you will see a button ?Add to Favorites.?  When you click this, it will add the character to your favorites list and the tab selection will reappear.

Best,

Paul
