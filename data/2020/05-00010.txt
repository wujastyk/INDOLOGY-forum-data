[INDOLOGY] corona deaths
Dear All,
I am a great fan of the corona-verses, but, of course, understand the
problem raised by prof. Tikken.
I am Polish and in my country sudden death caused e.g. by various enemies
(like Germans and Russians during the II WW) or by our compatriots (like
during Stalin's time, or during the martial law in 1981-84) was a normal
event and in my country, the more dangerous situation is, the more jokes
are created. I cannot imagine a difficult life without jokes. Now, our
political situation is also very dark (one man self-burnt in protest two
years ago), and I don't know how I could endure it without jokes, memes,
funny songs and videos. I think that such jokes do not derogate death, but
they are a sure way to survive even the most difficult situations.
So I would very appreciate the newsletter or any other kind of distribution
of corona-jokes if anyone would like to.
Regards and best wishes,
Joanna
