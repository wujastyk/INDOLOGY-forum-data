[INDOLOGY] On Bhamati.
Respected scholars,&nbsp;"Bhamati" written and composed by Bachaspati Misra&nbsp; , as a commentary on Shankaracharya' version of Brahma Sutra, takes it's name from&nbsp; his wife by the same name.It may be a curious query to search if any&nbsp; records exist about the person named Bhamati, Bachaspati Misra's wife? .... whether she played any significant role in helping her husband compose this Magnum Opus..
