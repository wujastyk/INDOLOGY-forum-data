> Apparently (according to the 'thisbloglife' article, and also by the licences or contracts made with only selected publishers on the different - English, French, Spanish - markets), there seems to be a copyright on the design itself (beside the fact that 'Dwarsligger' is itself a Dutch registred trademark): according to a Wiki article (written by the publisher, except a line added by me...) for the ".2 Point Deux" French series of "ultra-poches" (http://www.editionspoint2.com/ <http://www.editionspoint2.com/>), "La Martini?re Groupe a d?cid? de racheter les droits du format pour la France au d?but de l'ann?e 2010 et pour deux ans", and the printing itself remains made by Jongbloed ("Les textes sont imprim?s sur du papier-bible par l'inventeur hollandais"), see:  http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_Deux <http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_Deux>

>> I think you're right, Christophe.  The widespread use of this format in India arguably constitutes "prior art <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_art>".  But Jongbloed may have genuinely invented a novel spine and binding, I don't know.  If Jongbloed tried to sue Khemaraja Shreekrishnadas on the physical format, I think the might fail.  It would only arise if KS tried to compete.  Seems highly unlikely :-)   Is the claim for copyright on the design, or a registered trademark on the names, rather?  I didn't see a copyright claim in the links you posted.

>> I wonder what's the difference with the Pothi form used in Indian printing since the 19th century and still in use in publishing houses like the Venkateswara Press in Mumbai (see the smallest pocket Bhagavadgita available in Flipback/Pothi form at http://www.khe-shri.com/khemraj.htm <http://www.khe-shri.com/khemraj.htm>). Can this Western (at least Dutch...) commercial capture (this is not very Christian for a Bible publisher...) of an Indian design remain without reaction?

>> Attached is a picture from the on-line guided lessons for Maurer's "The Sanskrit Language".   It shows a  book with  text  oriented in the book 90 degrees different from the normal orientation in most western books.  I've seen this orienttion in some small devanagari chanting books.  I'm curious how common this orientation is, if it is only used for chanting books or if it is a feature of certain publishers or any other information.
