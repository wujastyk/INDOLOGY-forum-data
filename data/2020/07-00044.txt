[INDOLOGY] Scholarship on Kinnar/Hijra
All,
I am looking for scholarships on the Kinnars/Hijras especially in the
context of rituals around the womb, menstruation, pregnancy, and fertility
in general.
Additionally, interviewees have stated that Gorakshanath in one of his many
births was born as a kinnar. Hence, the Kinnar Akhara owns 50% of Nath
fortunes. Love some information on this as well.
Thank you.
Best,
Sravana
