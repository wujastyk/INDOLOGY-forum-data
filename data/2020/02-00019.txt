[INDOLOGY] Deshpande Genealogy
Hi Asko,
     Yes, the word ??? in Marathi is derived from ??????.  In older forms
of Marathi, a teacher was called ??????.  In modern Marathi, however, ???
is simply an honorific, alternating with ??? [< ???], and it does not
retain its meaning as scholar or officer of the state.  Why some Marathi
names typically have ???, and others typically have ???, needs to be
investigated.  I have noticed that ??? is typically found among Brahmins,
while ??? is found in all Marathi communities.  But even among Brahmin
names, it is always ????????? and not ?????????, and always ???????, and
not ???????.  I have not figured out why this is the case.
