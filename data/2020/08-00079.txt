[INDOLOGY] Question
I also am puzzled by a feature of Sanskrit versification and sandhi (though
simpler than the feature Madhav asked about).
In verse 6 of the *Ku??alin?-stava?*  sandhi is broken between padas 3 and
4 for metrical purposes.  Is this an anomaly or is it permitted to break
sandhi between padas 1and 2 or  3 and 4 for metrical purposes.
