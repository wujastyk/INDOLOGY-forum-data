[INDOLOGY] Thank you
Dear all,
I have been sent four replies to my request for the translation of the
Bengali.
Fortunately they all agree with each other. The list is as I expected a
simple list form the top-most layer to the lowest one. But I am very
grateful not to have to rely on intuition.
Thank you all,
John
