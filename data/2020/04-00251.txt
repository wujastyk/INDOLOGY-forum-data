[INDOLOGY] email address of Dr. Katarzyna Marciniak
Esteemed scholars, 
I would appreciate it very much if someone could provide me with a current email address of Dr. Katarzyna Marciniak, the co-editor of The Mah?vastu A New Edition. Perhaps she is a member of this list? My internet search failed. 
Many thanks!
