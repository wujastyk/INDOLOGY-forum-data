Subject: [INDOLOGY] Symposium on "Kunwar Narain's poetry in translation", Univ. of Lausanne (Switzerland), March 2021
Message-ID: <A7A8DD80-F889-4310-9EC0-A156CB2006C5@unil.ch>

Dear Colleagues,

Together with Apurva Narain and Prof. Angela Sanmann (a colleague at the Unil, working at the Centre de traduction litt?raire de Lausanne, CTL), I am organizing an international symposium on the renowned Hindi poet Kunwar Narain and his poetry in translation, to be held at the University of Lausanne (Switzerland) at the end of March 2021.

You will find the CFP attached to this message with all needed information. Our intention is to gather 10-12 translators and researchers on Kunwar Narain's poetry. The final selection will of course depend on the abstracts sent. We do hope that the topic will be of interest to you and that some of you will be interested in participating in the symposium.

The symposium is scheduled for the end of March 2021. However, depending on the evolution of the pandemic at the international level and the final dates of the festival Le Printemps de la po?sie, to which we shall be associated, we might have to modify the dates indicated (25-26 March) ? but this will be done only if there is a real necessity. Of course, participants will be notified as soon as possible.

We have indicated September 1 as the deadline for submitting proposals and abstracts, but a response from your part before that date will of course be welcomed. We thank you in advance.

With the best wishes and kind regards from the organizers,

Nicola Pozza
