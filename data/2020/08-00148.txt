S?tras of Jaimini, vol. 27, they also included Sandal's Introduction, vol. 28, of ccxl pages. If you have that reprint, you have Sandal's introduction. I have not seen the Motilal Banarsidass reprint. AMS Press also reprinted the ccxl-page Introduction separately (vol. 28), as a hardback. This reprint is still available, and cheap, from Powells Bookstore Chicago, through AbeBooks: https://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?clickid=WOTxVOVT3xyORVZwUx0Mo3bwUkiQabWRyVQIyA0&cm_mmc=aff-_-ir-_-1783343-_-684384&ref=imprad1783343&afn_sr=impact&tn=mimamsa%20sutras&isbn=&kn=&an=sandal&vci=62903 <https://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?clickid=WOTxVOVT3xyORVZwUx0Mo3bwUkiQabWRyVQIyA0&cm_mmc=aff-_-ir-_-1783343-_-684384&ref=imprad1783343&afn_sr=impact&tn=mimamsa%20sutras&isbn=&kn=&an=sandal&vci=62903>. It is a high quality hardback. I have both physical volumes.
