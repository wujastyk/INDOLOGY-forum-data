[INDOLOGY] World Sanskrit Conference 2022 revised dates: 10-14 January 2022
Dear Colleagues,
As we have previously advised, due to the continued COVID-19 situation, and the uncertainty regarding international travel to Australia in early 2021, the Organising Committee has made the difficult decision to postpone WSC 2021 for 12 months.
We had originally planned to keep the same dates, but our host organisation, the Australian National University, has just advised that we will be able to access the top-rate, newly completed conference facilities the week prior to the dates originally advertised. We would like to take advantage of this offer to ensure that the WSC is held in the most conducive possible environment.
Therefore, we have revised the dates for WSC 2022 to 10-14 January 2022.
We hope this does not cause inconvenience for any of you.
The new scheduled dates for WSC 2022 are 10-14 January 2022, in Canberra, Australia
All abstracts that have been submitted are currently under review, and this will continue. Panel and Special Panel convenors are requested to continue to finalise the program based on the abstracts we have received. Authors will have the opportunity to withdraw or modify abstracts in early 2021, as desired.
If you have already registered to attend WSC 2021, your registration will be rolled over to 2022. Please contact us via email to wsc2021 at kaigi.com.au<mailto:wsc2021 at kaigi.com.au> if you would prefer to receive a full refund of your registration fee paid.
Please keep an eye on the conference website www.wsc2021.com.au<http://www.wsc2021.com.au> for further updates.
We look forward to seeing you in Australia in 2022!
Apologies for cross-posting,
