Dear Colleague and All,

Check Manu 9.14-17; that?s where you find language (pau??caly?(t) etc.) that could be taken to suggest that all women are ?prostitutes?, but the purpose of these verses seems simply to be to cast doubts on the trustworthiness of women and thereby to justify the need to keep them under constant control.

Best wishes,

HHH

Dear List Members,

I need your help in understanding something from Manusmriti.

Is there any passage/rule in this text that states that ?all women are prostitutes?? Or anything close to such thought?

In Tamilnadu, there is a severe extremist movement wanting to burn Manusmriti. As the next election is approaching, the political scene is getting ugly as usual. One party?s propaganda includes that Manusmriti should be removed/burned down since it looks at women as prostitutes.

I was wondering if any of you would kindly check Manusmriti and let me know if he really declared that all women are prostitutes.

I would very much appreciate your help.

Thanks and regards,
V.S.Rajam
