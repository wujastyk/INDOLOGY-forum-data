I would add to Aleksandar's suggestion the thought that Ch?ndogya VIII may be, at least in part, post-Buddhist and in fact a response to early Buddhism. This has to do with the exercise of "finding" (anu-vid, upa-labh) the self, which resonates closely with Pali materials in terms of both meaning and lexicon, but seems framed rather differently than the issue of knowledge of the self in other relatively early materials. If this idea is at all credible, it should not imply that the Ch?ndogya as a whole is so late, just the redaction of the final section.

best to all,
Matthew

There is discussion of the relative chronology of the B?had?ra?yaka upani?ad in Bronkhorst's Greater Magadha, esp. chapter IIA.3 and in part III Chronology.  The discussion is mainly in the context of the doctrine of Y?j?avalkya's teachings and ?tman, karman and punarjanman, and does not discuss the ???v?syopani?ad specifically.

Best,

Dear Colleagues,

     I have been rereading Professor Paul Thieme's article on the ??opani?ad published in the JAOS.  In one of his discussions, he seems to claim that the Ch?ndogya-Upani?ad is older than the ??a.  Here is that passage:

What is a good modern discussion about the relative chronology of the "older" Upani?ads?  Has anyone discussed Thieme's views?  With best regards,
