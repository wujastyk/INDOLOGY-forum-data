Dear Peter,
I retired from Muktabodha a few years ago but at that time all the source
materials for the searchable section of the Muktabodha Digital Library were
at the India office in Varanasi.  I've sent you the contact information for
the supervisor of the india office offlist.
Thanks,
Harry Spier
