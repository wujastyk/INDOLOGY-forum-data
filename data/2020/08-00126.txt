Dear Indologists,

In the documentary film Altar of Fire, one of the priests discusses the deliberations surrounding the traditional goat sacrifices and reports that they decided not to sacrifice the goats in this Agnicayana.  What exactly do they substitute for the goats?

Thank you for your help.
Wishing everyone well,
