[INDOLOGY] "Psychological complexity" of Sanskrit language/literature
I don't know if this is related to the question asked, but I have noticed a
lot of Sanskrit words referring to emotional states that literally narrate
the physical symptoms of that emotion.  Here are a few examples that come
to my mind:
??????? ? ?????????
??:????? ? ??:???????
?????? ? ?????????
???????????
???/???+????
??+????? / ??????
Buddhist usage: ????????'???? ????????
????+?? > ???????
These are just a few examples that come to mind.  One can think of more.
Descriptions of various ?????, ?????? etc. contributing to the experience
of ?? may be another place to look for the connection to the physical to
emotional states.
