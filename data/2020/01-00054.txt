[INDOLOGY] On Bhamati.
It is believed that, she was with husband without his knowledge for years.
Even on his marriage occasion he was busy reading books. After years have
elapsed, one night when  he was writing a commentary on BS,  there was a
sudden darkness due to the lack of oil in the lamp. A lady came lit the
fire. At that time VM realized he has a wife. He asks about how she managed
to earn for living etc, later VM suggests his wife to leave.
