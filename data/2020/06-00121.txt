Message-ID: <CAB3-dzd84dkP4Ta7orTRk7btw8vjsyqNzRpvM0Z4FgvN+Jczvg@mail.gmail.com>

What is the exact significance of the terms ?????? and ???? as they appear
in qualifying several mantras, stotras etc?  I have seen these terms, but
did not think further about them. Someone asked me this question, and I did
not have an answer.
