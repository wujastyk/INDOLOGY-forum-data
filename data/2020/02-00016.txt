     Difficult to say.  From the story about Lukambhatta that I recounted,
it seems that his role as a court astrologer may have given him the title
of Bhatta.  Otherwise, Panta or Rao are the common honorifics used in
Marathi.  Some names typically get Panta, while others typically get Rao.
For my name, I have always heard Madhav Rao, but for my father, it was
always Murlidhar Panta.
