The practice in the Tibetan tradition that Dean referred to is called
lung-gom, and a practitioner of it is a lung-gom-pa. If you do a search for
these terms you will find what little is known about it. I assume that the
Tibetan spelling is rlung sgom, where rlung means pr??a (or v?yu), and sgom
means meditation or contemplation or cultivation (bh?van?).

Best regards,
