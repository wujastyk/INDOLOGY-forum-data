Dear Tim,

The good news is that you won't have to retype anything, because the more
recent XeLaTeX system can be set up to read Velthuis transliteration and
turn it into lovely Devanagari.  Here's a minimum working example
<https://cikitsa.blogspot.com/2020/09/simple-example-of-using-xelatex-for.html>.
TeX does this in one pass, and the devnag processor is not required.

About the Mac, I'm completely in the dark.  Sorry!  But TeXlive (the main
distribution from TUG) does say it works on MacOS
<https://www.tug.org/texlive/>.  (click macOS <https://www.tug.org/mactex/>
),
