=?utf-8?Q?Re:_[INDOLOGY]_Symbols_in_=C5=9Aatapatha_Br=C4=81hma=E1=B9=87a_text?=
?*gum*? is an onomatopoeic expression for "humming", an ?imitation of the
humming of bees? (MW, s.v.), so *gu?-k?ra* has a meaning, which is: ?the
sound of humming?.
Replacing an Anusv?ra with the prompt (as I understand it) "*gu?k?ra*"
should therefore mean that at this point the pronunciation of a
(particular) nasal humming/buzzing sound is appropriate: "[Make] the
buzzing sound".
