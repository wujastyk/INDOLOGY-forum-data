?*gum*? is an onomatopoeic expression for "humming", an ?imitation of the
humming of bees? (MW, s.v.), so *gu?-k?ra* has a meaning, which is: ?the
sound of humming?.

Replacing an Anusv?ra with the prompt (as I understand it) "*gu?k?ra*"
should therefore mean that at this point the pronunciation of a
(particular) nasal humming/buzzing sound is appropriate: "[Make] the
buzzing sound".

WS
