Dear Johannes and Rolf,
I am not familiar with the Vivekavil?sa aside from the bare bones facts: its author is Jinadatta S?ri (1280-1332), a Jain work I believe. So the following is offered tentatively.
This verse struck me as slightly ironic, passive-aggressively demeaning - several of the terms he uses (for which other, more respectful terms could have been employed) either have ?aivite connotations (being descriptors of ?iva), or they are allusions to animals, blood, etc. I?m not sure that k?tti? kama??alur can be treated as a compound, since k?tti is feminine and kama??alu is masculine.
K?tti, according to Monier-Williams, is also ?the hide or skin on which the religious student sits or sleeps, (usually the skin of an antelope)? as well as ?the bark of the birch tree (used for writing upon.? So it could refer to a meditation mat (an Indian zafu / zabutan); tantrics in that period might have used an animal hide for that. Or it could be a reference to the literary productivity of Buddhists.
As for kama??alu, a Wikipedia page (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamandalu) reports ?The kamandalu may be made of various materials, including metal, clay, wood and dry gourd.? It doesn?t mention leather. It also provides some detail on how the water symbolizes asceticism for Hindus, the water it contains considered am?ta. But, adding to the ironic possibilities of the verse, it also states the following:
?Buddhists pour water from the kamandalu onto the palms of people, before rituals, where the water symbolizes elixir of life.[24] It is also called bhumba.[25] Bodhisattvas like Maitreya and Avalokiteshvara are depicted carrying the kamandalu.[26][27] The kamandalu was initially imported from Brahmanical Hinduism to Buddhism, through god Brahma to Maitreya; it later was incorporated in representations of many Mahayana Buddhist deities.[28]
Jain Digambara sages use the kamandalu for storing water for "toilet purposes".[29]?
