[INDOLOGY] Searching archive.org: Canada/Sanskrit
I've been adding metadata for some years, now, in a slow and not very
structured manner.
What I do is use the "Reviews" section, and use a standard header
"bibliographical information" and give a zero star rating (for no good
reason).  Like this one <https://archive.org/details/susruta1931> or this
one <https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.327618/>.  Nowadays I
have also taken to using the standard phrase "Worldcat permalink: "
followed by the permalink URL from the corresponding Worldcat entry. Like this
one <https://archive.org/details/hirthanniversary00hirt>.
The Reviews section does get searched, when one does a metadata search.
If you are going to start doing metadata, perhaps you should coordinate
with Carl Malamud <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Malamud>, who has an
alert that pops up for him when I personally add metadata.  (Incidentally,
it is Carl to whom we owe the enormous benefit of having the Digital
Library of India available within Archive.org.)
Best,
Dominik
