[INDOLOGY] Buddha's visit to Lanka
Let me add that ?Adam?s footprint? is as much or more Muslim tradition than Christian. The mountain is mentioned as a Muslim pilgrimage as early as 1310 in the History of the Mamluk Sultans by Muf?zz?l Ibn Abil-F?zail.

Re: [INDOLOGY] Buddha's visit to Lanka
The same Sri Lankan chronicles that talk about the Buddha?s visit to Sri Lanka would be the main primary sources about Mahinda?s transmission of the Dharma/Dhamma there. And it must be added that these sources also say that Ashoka?s daughter, the nun Sanghamitta, was part of that mission, with her establishing a bhikkunis order just as monk Mahinda established one of bhikkhus.
Additionally, this is not ?proof? either, but regarding the Buddha?s alleged visit, many Buddhists believe that the tallest peak in Sri Lanka bears the footprint of his Lankavatara or ?descent onto Lanka? (as in the name of the scripture Matthew mentioned). Hence this mountain is known as Sri Pada or ?Sacred Footprint?. Perhaps unsurprisingly, many Christians maintain that the dent in the rock is not Buddha?s but Adam?s footprint (hence the mountain?s well-known English name), Adam?s Peak), many Hindus believe it Vishnu?s, and if memory serves, many Muslims say it is that of some Sufi saint.

Re: [INDOLOGY] Buddha's visit to Lanka
Perhaps equally relevant is the foundational idea that Buddhism was transmitted to the island by Mahinda, son of the emperor Asoka. Much has been written about this, some of it useful.

Dear Alakendu Das,
There is no "proof" of this, but it is certainly a very old and widespread tradition.
The important Mah?y?na scripture, the La?k?vat?ras?tra, which dates in its present form to about the early fifth century C.E.,
is in part based on this tradition, for example, and therefore shows that it must have been current before this time.
Perhaps the rapid and successful implantation of Buddhism in Sri Lanka encouraged the development and acceptance of the legend.

[INDOLOGY] Buddha's visit to Lanka
Respected Scholars,
I had posted this query in the past
.May I be excused to raise it once again , as I haven't got any answer to it.
I quote from "Dipavamsa" the oldest Pali Chronicle , from Sri Lanka,which goes as follows-
"DipAgamanam Buddhassa Dhatu ca Bodhiyagamam"
I would like to stress on the word"DipAgamanam Buddhassa"
My question is whether any evidence exists which goes on to prove that Siddharth Gautam Buddha  visited Sri Lanka?
