One has to distinguish between  figures who are cursed, for one reason or another to take on the form of a r?k?asa. One example that Matthew raises is that of Vir?dha who was really the gandharva Tumburu who was cursed by Vai?rana?a to suffer this transformation. But when propitiated,  Vai?rava?a relented to the extent of allowing him to be restored to his original state after being killed by R?ma. VR 3. 3) Same deal with Kabandha (VR 3.67). Indeed this is a common trope in the literature. But this is quite different from the case of those who are actual r?k?asas by birth ( The origin and  genealogy of the r?k?asas is laid out in detail in the first half of V?lm?ki?s Uttarak???a.)
The idea that  ?genetic? r?k?asas either seek  or attain death at R?ma?s hands as a means of salvation is utterly alien to V?lm?ki?s poem. It develops, along with the whole concept of dve?abhakti in the sectarian pur??as (cf. the tale of P?tan? in the Bh.P.) and is a staple of the ?v?stava? level of interpretation of many of the commentators of the V?lm?ki R?m?ya?a.
Best to all.
