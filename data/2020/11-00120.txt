=?utf-8?Q?[INDOLOGY]_vekura=C3=B1ja?=
Dear List members,
I have not closely followed the discussion of the word vekura?ja. I did see, though, that the discussion has switched to a?vatara. This word is discussed by R;L. Turner, "Type a?vatara in New Indo-Aryan", which has appeared in Pratid?nam. Indian, Iranian and Indo_European Studies Presented to F.B.J. Kuiper. The Hague, 1969, pp. 319-20.
I am afraid, though, this article is helpful in the present discussion about the meaning and derivation of vekura?ja.
