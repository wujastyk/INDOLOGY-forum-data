The edition of the autograph manuscript was made by T.

Anquetil Duperron, who translated the French part in Latin).

> Filliozat's achievement is remarkable. After a general introduction on the 17th-18th centuries Jesuit missionary work on Indian languages and civilization (pp. 9-24), a chapter is devoted to the figure of Jean-Fran?ois Pons (pp. 25-47), another to the edition of his letters (pp. 49-80; of five, the last, longest one, on Brahmin knowledge had been previously published as one of the Lettres ?difiantes); there follows the introduction to the manuscripts and the indigenous grammatical sources of the author (pp. 81-95), then the annotated edition of the two parts (with a French translation of the Latin text) (pp. 97-197), and finally the color-facsimile of the two manuscripts (pp. 199-282). A bibliography and index are given at the end. A few extracts of the book are provided here:
