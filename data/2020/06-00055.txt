[INDOLOGY] poison
Dear colleagues,
In post-classical India, vi?a??stra became synonymous with a branch of 
Tantric medicine that I wrote a book about a few years ago:

Mention of manufactured poison (k?trima) is rare in the literature, to 
answer Jonathan comment; one rather used poisonous plants, or less 
commonly, extracted venom.? And there are fascinating uses of minuscule 
amounts of poison for healing that I touch on in the book, responding to 
Jan's comment.
Best,
Michael
