Dear All,
The generosity and efforts of all concerned are marvellous and deserve the utmost admiration of all including a nit-picking nobody like my humble self.
Unfortunately, under Tome 4 one can find Tome VI (the same file as under Tome 6), but the proper Tome IV (Les hymnes to Vi?vedev??) is missing. I have the correct file at my disposal and am willing to share it, but 7,6 MB is probably too large to attach. 
Technically, I am not sure how to upload it to the Archive.org. Any help?
Best regards,
Jan Filipsky, Prague
