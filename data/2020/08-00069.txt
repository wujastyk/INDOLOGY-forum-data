[INDOLOGY] Need help on a publication
I am looking for a publication that has the ???v?sya Upa?i?ad given with
its Padap??ha.  I have pdfs of the first two volumes of the ?ukla-Yajurveda
K??va-Sa?hit? edited by B.R. Sharma and published by the Vaidika
Samshodhana Mandala of Pune.  But these cover only the first half of the
Sa?hit?.  The ??? Upani?ad occurs at the very end of the Sa?hit?.  I would
appreciate if anyone has access to the remaining volumes of this
publication, or an edition of the M?dhyandina Sa?hit? with Padap??ha, that
would be greatly appreciated.
