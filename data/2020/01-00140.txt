=?utf-8?Q?Re:_[INDOLOGY]_Vajras=C5=ABc=C4=AB?=
For some reason, the ?fi? dropped from my self-quoted passage (I only noticed one occasion). You probably figured that out, but in case:
Prama?n?a-theory first appears in the eleventh chapter of the first part (Su?tra-stha?na) of the CS [Caraka-sa?hit?]. Here the CS intriguingly proposes, along with the three prama?n?as one would expect (perception, inference, and authori- tative testimony), a fourth not found anywhere else: synthetic inductive reasoning (yukta-prama?n?a). Discussion of prama?n?a occurs in two other parts of the CS: part 3, Vima?na-stha?na, chap. 4 and chap. 8, but the unique yukta-prama?n?a is absent from those discussions, a sign of the stratified nature of the text.
