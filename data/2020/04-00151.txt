[INDOLOGY] Mayavada (was Lines to an Advaitin)
Dear Dean,
thanks to Harry Spier, who referred to a previous thread, you?ve already
received
numerous references addressing your bibliographic question concerning
?which texts
are considered to be from which Shankara? comprising decades of research by
scholars,
and some major names (such as Nakamura, Hacker, Halbfass) had likewise
already
been mentioned in the course of this thread.
Unfortunately, Potter?s online Bibliography is hopelessly incomplete
(https://faculty.washington.edu/kpotter/xsec.htm#[AV]),
yet going through it might also help you getting references related to your
earlier request (? 'avidya' or 'mithya' rather than 'maya' ? scholarly
discussion of
these terms and the associated concepts ?).
E.g., neither Sengaku Mayeda?s *A Thousand Teachings *(1992) nor
Govind Chandra Pande?s *Life and Thought of ?a?kar?c?rya* (1994), both
containing
significant discussions (and further references) related to your request,
are mentioned.
Neither is Vidyasankar Sundaresan?s important article
?What determines ?a?kara?s Authorship? The Case of the Pa?c?kara?a?,
*Philosophy East & West*, vol. 52.1 (2002): 1-35.
Among the numerous works (often discussing technical terms) of Sri Swami
Satchid?nandendra [spelling as on the title page], not least the one
translated by
A. J. Alston under the title *The Method of the Vedanta. A Critical Account
of *
*the Advaita Tradition* (Delhi, Motilal, 1997) might be relevant for you
(adding to that made by others [cf. references provided by the indicated
previous
thread], for a concise scathing critique of ascribing the *Vivekac???ma?i*
to ?a?kara,
the author of *Brahmas?trabh??ya*, see p. 22).
Studying all of these works might keep you busy for quite some time.
All the best, Hartmut
