[INDOLOGY] MacDevnag on 64-bit systems
Dear Tim and members of the list,
A bit late response but getting back to the original point? and just in case there still is a need to run devnag on a Mac? 
If you have the latest MacTeX that corresponds to TeXLive 2020, it installs the binary of devnag as part of the package. /usr/local/texlive/2020/bin/x86_64-darwin/devnag
It shows up as /Library/TeX/texbin/devnag. So, as long as /Library/TeX/texbin is in your PATH, it will run.
I discovered this by chance a few weeks ago, to my surprise. It works fine on Catalina.
Best,
Kengo
