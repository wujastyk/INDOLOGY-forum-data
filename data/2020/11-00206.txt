 In the 11th century, a scholar named ?r?dhara selected passages from
Var?hamihira?s *Laghuj?takam*, his *B?hajj?takam*, and Kaly??avarman?s
*S?r?vali* and translated them into new Kannada to create a text titled the
*J?takatilaka?*. I suppose the question here is less what constitutes
?translation? and more what constitutes a ?text.? There are a number of
other authors from the period who translate long passages from Sanskrit
sciences, especially the works of Var?hamihira, into Kannada.



Elaine Fisher at Stanford is working on a project right now on 16th
and 17th-century
translations within the V?ra?aiva community. I am unsure if she has
published the materials yet, but she has many.


All the best,

Eric
