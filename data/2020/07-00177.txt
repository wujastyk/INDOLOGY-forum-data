Dear Colleagues,

     I have been rereading Professor Paul Thieme's article on the
??opani?ad published in the JAOS.  In one of his discussions, he seems to
claim that the Ch?ndogya-Upani?ad is older than the ??a.  Here is that
passage:

What is a good modern discussion about the relative chronology of the
"older" Upani?ads?  Has anyone discussed Thieme's views?  With best regards,
