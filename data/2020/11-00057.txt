[INDOLOGY] sources for the idea that reincarnation is a semi-random process?
Hi Dean
Great question. Back in the 1990s we read a Tibetan medical text with Bob
Thurman at Columbia (some of my fellow students at the time might remember
the title) and it had an interesting bit on reincarnation, with the
incarnator feeling Freudian-like sexual attraction towards the new mother
if being born as a male, or towards the new father if being born as a
female, and seeing the house as a palace regardless of its actual
appearance. If I recall correctly there was something in the text about the
incarnator's karma playing a key role in the parental/home
selection/perception, and there may have been something there about a
certain randomness or uncertainty in the process that may be relevant to
your question.
Cheers
James
