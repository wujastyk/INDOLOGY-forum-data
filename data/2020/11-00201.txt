 Dear list members,
I'm writing?in the hope that someone may be able to provide me with a copy of the paper 'The Present Relations Between Eastern and Western Philosophy' by the Oxford philosopher H. H. Price. This paper was originally published in The Hibbert Journal vol. 53 no.3 (1955) and it is this version I am after, rather than the reprinted version in Philosophy Today (1957).?
Many thanks in advance to anyone who can help!
