[INDOLOGY] attached pdf
Dear Aleksandar (if I may),
and other knowledgeable friends who are willing to help. It seems the pdf file was not created strictly correctly and has some faults that are fortunately ignored by the Chrome embedded reader ? therefore to download the file on an internal disk and dropdrag it by mouse to Chrome would help.
Thank you for your interest and enjoy the ?ataka.
With best regards,
Jan Filipsky

Re: [INDOLOGY] attached pdf
I can confirm this. Neither the reader nor the full adobe acrobat reads the file properly. 
A simple solution is to install an alternative pdf reader from the Microsoft Store. I tried with Drawboard PDF, which works; or use the Chrome embedded reader, which also works. 
Best wishes

Re: [INDOLOGY] attached pdf 
Dear Colleagues,
sorry to trouble you with a technical problem, but no matter how much I try, I am unable to read the ?ataka on my IBM PC ? only the title page of the journal is depicted correctly, but the remaining pages are blank. I have tried both Adobe Acrobat Reader DC as well as Adobe Acrobat 9.0, but with the same result ? error 14. I was told that such problems occasionally arise when the PDF is created on a Mac platform (this is probably that case) and is incompatible with IBM PC. Can somebody share his/her experience with similar problems?
With best regards,
Jan Filipsky
