[INDOLOGY] Mayavada (was Lines to an Advaitin)
Dear List,
I take the opportunity of this thread for asking if there is any news about the completing of the new critical edition of Bh?skara's Brahmas?trabh??ya prepared by Takahira Kato on the basis of J.A.B. Van Buitenen's unpublished material? See Kato's article issued in WZKS 2009-2010 for the history of Van Buitenen's work, ready to be issued in the HOS in the 1960s, then lost and finally handed over by Walter Slaje under whose supervision Kato was working at the end of the 2000s.

Kato declares in his article that Van Buitenen work "will soon be made available to scholars", and indeed a diplomatic edition of Van Buitenen's work was provided at the end of his Ph.D. (see the link below  given  by E. Freschi in 2014, still working). However, since for his PhD,  Kato's new critical edition (with additional material to VB's work) covers only adh. 1 and 2 of the BS, I would be interested to know if the rest of the editorial work is still in course of preparation and if one can expect the publication of this new edition in a near future.
Best wishes,
Christophe
