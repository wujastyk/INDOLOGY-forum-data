It seems a pdf is available for a small fee here: 

https://www.cultura.com/site-urbain-et-sites-funeraires-des-environs-de-pondichery-tea-9782705959197.html

I have never tried this website so satisfaction not guaranteed.

It is frustrating that on the whole French books are much less easily available online than books in English.
