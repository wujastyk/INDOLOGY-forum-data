[INDOLOGY] sources for the idea that reincarnation is a semi-random process?
Dear Colleagues,
In addition to the work of Ian Stevenson, mentioned by Gleb Sharygin, I would add the ongoing work of Jim Tucker, Stevenson?s successor at the University of Virginia, who has sought to correct the elements of bias found in Stevenson?s research.
A noteworthy article in this regard, co-authored by Jonathan Edelmann and William Bernet, is ?Setting Criteria for Ideal Reincarnation Research? (Journal of Consciousness Studies, 14(12), December 2007). (I apologize if this has already been mentioned somewhere in this thread and I failed to notice it.)
All the best,
Jeff
