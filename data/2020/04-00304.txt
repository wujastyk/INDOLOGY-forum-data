[INDOLOGY] Professor Patrick Olivelle honoured
Dear Colleagues,
Professor Patrick Olivelle has just been elected to the American Academy of
Arts and Sciences, among the new members for 2020. He is likely to be too
modest to share the news with us, so I thought I would let his colleagues,
students, friends and admirers know.

With warm congratulations to Professor Olivelle for this well-deserved
honour,
Yours,
Ananya Vajpeyi.
