[INDOLOGY] Indian jewellery
Dear Alessandro,
"The Encyclopedia of India", Ed. in Chief Stanley Wolper, 2006, has a  
good article on "Jewellery" in vol. II with several bibliographic  
references. And, just in case you are not aware of it, a search for  
"jewellery" in the SARDS database (www.sards.uni-halle.de) gives 26  
results.
With best wishes
Martin
