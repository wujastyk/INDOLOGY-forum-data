Dear Nataliya
Has anyone mentioned mentioned the Buddhist tale, based on mistranslation between Middle Indian languages and/or Sanskrit, retold by John Brough, G?ndh?r? Dharmapada, pp. 45-6? It hinges on a misunderstanding of a Middle Indian form from the dvandva udaya-vyaya, ?arising and passing away?, as being from a tatpuru?a *udaka-baka, ?heron of the water?.
"This curious tale concerns the last days of Ananda, and tells how he chanced to overhear a certain monk reciting a Dharmapada-verse in the following manner (according to the Chinese versions):
If a man were to live for a hundred years, and not see a water-heron, it were better that he live only for one day, and see a water-heron.
?My son?, said ?nanda, 'the Buddha did not say this. What he said was:
If a man were to live for a hundred years, and not see the principle of coming into existence and passing away, it were better . . . (and so forth).
The monk thereupon reported the matter to his teacher, who replied, ??nanda is an old fool. Go on reciting as before?. On hearing once more the same faulty recitation, ?nanda realized that it was futile to attempt to convince the monk of the error, since ail his seniors, to whom he might have appealed, had already entered Nirv??a. Being thus unable to do anything further to protect the Buddha?s words from corruption, he considered that there was no reason to delay his own Nirv??a?
