Dear Indologists,
     What is the historical source for the post-position ?? in Hindi and
??/??  in Marathi?  I see some folks connect this directly with the
instrumental ending -??, as in ????.  At least in Marathi, I noticed Jules
Bloch saying this this -?? simply becomes ??, as in ????? ???? in Old
Marathi.  But then what is the source of ??????/???????  in Modern Marathi
and ?? in ??? ???  Any suggestions?
