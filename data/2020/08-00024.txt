Dear all
I have seen people(including my Guru ji)  saying ???????? (rule from
Ashtadhyayi)  as an expression shown to indicate, "not so great" "a very
small thing" or "idiot"  "stupid"  etc.
Is there any incident , story, joke, dantakathaa behind this??
Please can anyone throw some light on this matter.
Thanks
KP
