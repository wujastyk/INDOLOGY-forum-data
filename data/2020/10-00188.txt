The INDOLOGY list has no moderators.  It is not a moderated list.  It is up
to the members individually to internalize the guidelines
<https://indology.info/email/email-const/> and the RFC 1855: Netiquette
Guidelines <https://indology.info/email/email-rfc-1855/> by Sally Hambridge
(1995).

Threads and posts cannot be deleted.  They are archived forever.  Your
great, great grandchildren will see what you say here :-)
