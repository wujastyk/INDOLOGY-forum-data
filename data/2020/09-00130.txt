Subject: [INDOLOGY] Kannada font

I myself use this whenever I type in Devanagari or Bengali. It is really 
very simple to use, and I just checked - Kannada is also there ("Select 
a language" in the middle). It is really very simply to use and there is 
no downloading anything. Just type, copy, and paste.
