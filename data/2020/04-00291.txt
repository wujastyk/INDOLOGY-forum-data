Subject: [INDOLOGY] A Sanskrit logician to a Sanskrit Grammarian
Message-ID: <CAOy-tFTsrm4Dt3o20EV7HqreXy=oV9L2Y-wwkr_Otto8Gy=oPw@mail.gmail.com>

?????? ?????????????? ?????????? ???????? ?
?????? ????????? ??????? ?????????? ??? ??

bha, ga?, cvi (suffixes) will be called in the beginning and will be
changed to something, at the end.

Similarly, the grammarian, renowned as a chameleon always poor than a
monkey.

Regards,

Dr Arjuna
