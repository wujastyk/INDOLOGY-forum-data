Dear Johnathan,

There is no mention of *vi?a??stra* in the index of the *History of Indian
Medical Literature.* I am currently working on a project that catalogues
*rasa??stra* texts, which relies heavily on the *HIML.* Thus far I have
come across numerous references to poisons, purifying poisonous substances,
etc., but no recipes for making poisons. If I do happen across one I will
make a note of it for you.

Best wishes,

Patricia
