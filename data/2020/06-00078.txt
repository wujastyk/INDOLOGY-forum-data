Dear Harry,
Va???dhara in his comment on the first verse writes: kanakama?jar? na? ca rau lagau iti s?tr?t. The definition scans right, so to his mind the meter is Kanakama?jar?. I don?t know which s?tra he has in mind.
Best wishes,
Aleksandar

[INDOLOGY] Metre of gop?-g?tam
Dear list members,
Can anyone identify the meter of the gop?-g?tam (Bh?gavata X, chapter 31).
See this link: https://iskcondesiretree.com/page/gopi-gita<https://nam05.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fiskcondesiretree.com%2Fpage%2Fgopi-gita&data=02%7C01%7Caleksandar.uskokov%40yale.edu%7Ca85315ef070146b5ba7608d80e752cfe%7Cdd8cbebb21394df8b4114e3e87abeb5c%7C0%7C0%7C637275243718304252&sdata=vmdEi6anHUJYZv4%2Bzhfmq2xBIgPMMYpznQiXI8Dt9%2F8%3D&reserved=0>
It is 11 syllable's per line but as far as I can see it is different from the 11 syllable metres in Apte's dictionaries appendix.
Thanks,
Harry Spier
