[INDOLOGY] A distraction from the Coronavirus
Perhaps closing the eyes should always be on one's mind when the leader is not sarvaj?a and sarvavid, to keep with the Ka?ha/Mu??aka context.
I prefer the verse about pra??ntacitt?ya ?am?nvit?ya. So I will let further responses fly by.

... only to end up like the proverbial blind (yath?ndh??) who let themselves be guided by another blind man (andhenaiva n?yam?n??)? Closing one's eyes is certainly a congenial advice scholars would welcome from a scholar.

Where svaya?dh?r?? is the operative word.
All that we say as indologists would have been said in vain in the eyes of the ?ruti liberationists. What better time for liberating levity than this? Spectators can always close their eyes.

Has not the ?ruti said:
avidy?y?m antare vartam?n??
svaya?dh?r?? pa??ita?manyam?n?? |
dandramyam???? pariyanti m??h?
andhenaiva n?yam?n? yath?ndh?? ||
As it appears from the cascade of poetic performances to which we are exposed here as spectators, it was - alas - uttered in vain.

Just for the indological record (without wanting to encourage or discourage anyone here):
1. padma is also used as a masculine (examples: r?ghava? cintayitvaivam upetya cara?au pitu? /
ha?sa? padm?v iva navau jagr?ha nakhakesarau; or: adya tv atitar?? brahman mama bh?gyaviparyay?t /
himenev?hata? padmas sampanno harita? k??a?). 2. The metre in the "original" stanza is a (correct) Upaj?ti. Now it is a (correct) Indravajr?.
