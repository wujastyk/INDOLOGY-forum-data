Dear All,
I wonder if anyone has PDFs or scans of some sections from these two
volumes by Joshi and Roodbergen:
*Pata?jali?s Vy?kara?amah?bh??ya. Anabhihit?hnika.* Poona 1976.
*Pata?jali?s Vy?kara?amah?bh??ya. Vibhaktyahnika. *Poona 1979
I have seen online several other volumes from the series, but unfortunately
not these ones, and currently library services are unavailable, so I cannot
request a physical book or a scan. I of course would not want to infringe
any copyright laws, but would appreciate having access at least to some
sections. If anyone happens to have and would not mind sharing the scans of
the sections just on A???dhy?y? *2.3.2 **karma?i dvit?y? *and *2.3.18
**kart?kara?ayos
t?t?y?, *I would be much indebted.
