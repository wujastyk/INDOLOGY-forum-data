Dear Colleagues,
Because of the uncertainties due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic 
on the organisation of scientific events by the end of 2020 / beginning 
of 2021, the organisers (?milie Aussant, Pascale Rabault-Feuerhahn and 
Fabien Simon) decided to postpone the *SHESL conference ("Documentation 
and Description of Asian Languages - History and Epistemology") *in 
*January 2022* (the exact dates will be communicated later).
The submission deadline is postponed to *15th December 2020*.

Request for information and proposals should be sent to: shesl at shesl.org

Best wishes,
The organizing committee
