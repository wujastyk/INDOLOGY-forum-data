[INDOLOGY] Epidemics in Ayurveda
Dear all,
I hope you are all in good health and not going too stir crazy yet.
I wrote a short blog post on epidemics in Ayurveda that I thought I'd
share. It's nothing super profound but some of the parallels to the current
situation struck me as interesting.

Best wishes to you all.
