Subject: [INDOLOGY] Annual Allchin Symposium on South Asian Archaeology
Message-ID: <088cc280-3bfd-e063-4127-e519bc0ac131@cam.ac.uk>

Dear members of Indology,

I have recently joined the group. I am writing to invite you to the 
upcoming Annual Allchin Symposium on South Asian Archaeology, which will 
be held remotely?on Sunday 5th December 2020.

The primary focus of the event will be on the archaeology and art 
history of South Asia, though we will naturally be interested in papers 
that seek to put South Asia into a broader geographical context. More 
details and the Call for Papers are available at 
https://www.indiran.org/whats-on/allchin-symposium/ 
<https://www.indiran.org/whats-on/allchin-symposium/>

I would be extremely grateful if you could forward this event to any and 
all that you think might be interested. As mentioned on the webpage and 
in the Call for Papers, all abstract submissions and correspondence 
should be emailed to archaeologysouthasia at gmail.com 
<mailto:archaeologysouthasia at gmail.com>. *The Call for Papers is open 
until Sunday 8 November 2020*.

The event is also available on Facebook at https://fb.me/e/4kcSztEdM

Thank you very much.

With all best regards,

Dr Alessandro Ceccarelli

While it suits me to email outside normal working hours, I do not expect a response outside your own.
