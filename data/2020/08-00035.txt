=?utf-8?Q?[INDOLOGY]_Jayant=C4=AB?=
This is my understanding of the development of the term jayanti -
*Stage I ? Jayant? = ?r?jayant?*
Presumably the older sense of Jayant?  is interchangeable with ?r?jayant? .
This latter term refers only to the utsava celebrating the birthday of
K???a ? the dark a?tam? [or rohi?i asterism] of the ?r?va?a/Bh?drapada
month. This use of ?r?jayant?  in this sense still prevails among the
brahmana-s and other Hindu groups of Tami?-speaking territories. This
suggests that ?r?jayant? was probably* the* archetypical jayant? ].
Besides the usage by Madhvac?rya-P?r?apraj?a (1238?1317), the term is
attested in the ouvre of Ve?ka?an?tha-Ved?ntade?ika 1268?1369. The first
verse of Gop?lavi??ati repeated at the beginning of and Y?dav?bhyudaya uses
the term jayant? unmistakably in the sense of  ?r?jayant? .
*vande brnd?vanacaram vallav?janavallabha? |*
*jayant?sambhava? dh?ma vaijayant?vibh??a?am || *
The term is attested in a Si?h?calam inscription of  Narahari T?rtha
(1243-1333) where it is not clear if the expression ?r?jayant?  of
?r?narasi?han?tha refers to the K???ajayant?  or to the Narasi?hajayant? .
*Stage II ? The Birthday boom*
The appearance of the term  jayant?  in an extended sense increases in
the  inscriptions
of  Vijayanagara times [~ 14th century onwards]  and it is attached  to
other deities - K?rma, Narasimha, R?ma and V?mana, for example.
*Stage III ? Ossified in Government Parlance*
Currently, the term is lexicalized in the lingua franca of Indian
bureaucratese and applied to the remembrance days of all important (dead)
personages -  Buddha, Mah?v?ra, ?a?kara-, Basava, Gandhi and Ambedkar
(illustrative
list). There is also a G*?t?jayant? * to celebrate the ?birth anniversary?
of the Bhagavad g?t?.
The term in modern usage has the additional denotation of jubilee or
anniversary. For example Svar?a jayant? and Rajata jayant? for Golden
Jubilee and Silver Jubilee.
