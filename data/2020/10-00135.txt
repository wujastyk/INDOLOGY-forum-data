[INDOLOGY] Sad News
Dear James and Simon,
Thank you for this lovely tribute to Will even as I absorb the shock of the news. Will and I were Alexis Sanderson?s sole M.Phil students in the 80s when I first landed at Oxford. I ended up spending a lot of time with Will in my first year particularly. His obvious qualities of gentleness and kindness shone forth always. And his ways as a generous colleague and gifted scholar. We lost touch except sporadically but the memories - only positive - have never faded. I am grieved to hear this sad news.
Warmly yours,
Srilata
