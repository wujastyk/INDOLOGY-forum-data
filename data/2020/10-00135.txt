Dear James and Simon,
Thank you for this lovely tribute to Will even as I absorb the shock of the news. Will and I were Alexis Sanderson?s sole M.Phil students in the 80s when I first landed at Oxford. I ended up spending a lot of time with Will in my first year particularly. His obvious qualities of gentleness and kindness shone forth always. And his ways as a generous colleague and gifted scholar. We lost touch except sporadically but the memories - only positive - have never faded. I am grieved to hear this sad news.
Warmly yours,
Srilata

However, his extraordinary personal qualities were known only to those that had the pleasure and privilege of his company. We were fortunate to be in this category. All who knew him valued his innate gentleness, his infectious laugh and his delightful combination of deep generosity to others with a certain arch humour and a wryly detached demeanour. For young academics, as we were when we joined Cardiff University, Will?s attitude was a tonic; he managed to communicate complete commitment to his discipline and his students while seeming to have his foundations somehow elsewhere, and in firmer ground.

Yet he seemed at his fullest and most complete when he was creating something other than scholarship (in its most obvious sense). This was true of his poetry (and he published a very powerful volume, My Speaking Tongue, during his retirement in the face of the Motor Neurone Disease that eventually took his life), of the adaptations ? by him or others ? of his translations of Sanskrit plays, or his translations themselves. It was as if impeccable scholarship was, in the face of all this, a happy knack.
