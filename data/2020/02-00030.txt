Dear David,
thank you much for this rich additional information. Sorry for the non-reaching to the list of my previous message to which you answer: the mail "is being held until the list moderator can review it for approval. The reason it is being held: Message body is too big: 6756862 bytes with a limit of 4096 KB. Either the message will get posted to the list, or you will receive notification of the moderator's decision".
Anyway, my message can be read below yours, and the attachment (material cause of its non-posting), that is the scan of Rahder's article in AO,  is available with me on request. I add that the article of Matsuda Kazunobu you mention is unfortunately not available among the several ones he put on Academia: https://bukkyo-u.academia.edu/????
Best wishes,
Christophe

Le 5 f?vr. 2020 ? 01:45, David and Nancy Reigle <dnreigle at gmail.com<mailto:dnreigle at gmail.com>> a ?crit :

Dear Christophe,

Thank you very much for finding all this additional bibliographic information. Very interesting (and inspiring) about the Scheut Memorial Library that you provided a link to. Thank you also for attaching a scan of Rahder's article from Acta Orientalia giving the seventh bh?mi and its commentary by Vasubandhu (I seem to have misplaced my photocopy of it from his thesis).

While on this topic, it may be worthwhile to note that Rahder's edition of the Da?abh?mikas?tra was based on seven paper manuscripts. Kondo's edition was based on eight paper manuscripts, four of which are different from the ones used by Rahder. The two very old manuscripts reproduced by Matsuda Kazunobu indicate the need for a new Sanskrit edition of this text (Two Sanskrit Manuscripts of the Da?abh?mikas?tra, Preserved at The National Archives, Kathmandu. Bibliotheca Codicum Asiaticorum, 10. Tokyo: The Centre for East Asian Cultural Studies for Unesco, The Toyo Bunko, 1996). Interestingly, as Matsuda points out, neither of these two have the verses, g?th?s.

On the English translations, besides the one made by Megumu Honda that Potter referred to in the quotation you gave from him (I have a scan of this ready at hand if anyone needs it), and the two new ones made from the Chinese by Bhikshu Dharmamitra that I referred to, there is one included in Thomas Cleary's complete translation of the Avata?saka-s?tra from ?ik??nanda's Chinese published as The Flower Ornament Scripture: A Translation of the Avatamsaka Sutra, 3 vols., 1984-1987 (1-vol. edition, 1993), as chapter 26. However, Bhikshu Dharmamitra points out in his Translator's Introduction (p. 22) to his translation of the Da?abh?mika-s?tra from ?ik??nanda's Chinese translation of the Avata?saka-s?tra, chapter 26, that Cleary's translation

"appears to instead be a loose translation of the P. L. Vaidya Sanskrit edition of the Da?abh?mika S?tra. Hence his supposed translation of this chapter has little if any relation to ?ik??nanda's Chinese edition."

It may be noted that Bhikshu Dharmamitra has included the Vaidya edition of the Sanskrit in Roman transliteration (from the Digital Sanskrit Buddhist Canon Project) at the back of both of his translations of the Da?abh?mika-s?tra from the Chinese. He has correlated this to his translations by adding to them the alphabetical section headings (A, B, C, etc.) from the Vaidya Sanskrit edition, which originated with the Rahder edition. Vaidya's edition is based on Rahder's edition (see Vaidya's Introduction, p. 1). It is not exactly a "revised" edition, as Potter loosely termed it, since Vaidya did not have any additional materials from which to revise it. He apparently did not have access to Kondo's edition.

Description
Dissertation note :
Acad. proefschrift doctor in de Lett. en Wijsbeg. Rijksuniv. Utrecht


So as noted in the reference from the "Dutch Studies in South Asia, Tibet and classical Southeast Asia" web-page (quoted below), the printing of the thesis was in Louvain with the same printer J. Istas. It is in fact nearly the same exemplar as the SB?O (Geuthner) published one, except the cover and the additional pages "216-256" corresponding to the "second part" issued in Acta Orientalia 4, 1926, pp. 214-56 [there would exist a reprint of the latter in "SPJP [? not in the abbr. table] 581-623" according to Potter BIPh 81.1.3]; I attach here a scan of the AO publication.

After a quick checking, the pages published in Le Mus?on (then also printed by J. Istas, later managed by Peeters Publ.) 39, 1926, p. 125-252, correspond exactly to the part 1 (and only this first one) of the printed thesis and the book. In fact there was a double pagination in Le Mus?on for this article, also paged 1-128.
Mus?on pp. 125-152/1-28 = Book pp. I-XXVIII
153-252/29-128 = 1-[100]
(so the Appendice, pp. 1-28 is not in Le Mus?on)

There is a review of Rahder's thesis by C. A. F. Rhys Davids in The Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland no. 1 (Jan., 1927), pp. 160-162.

K. Potter in EIPh t. 8, 1999 (Buddhist Philosophy from 100 to 350 AD) p. 738 fn. 271, adds that "this work is available in Sanskrit and edited by Ryuko Kondo (Tokyo 1936; Kyoto 1983). An older edition by Johannes Rahder (Le Mus?on 39, 1926, 125-252) is available as revised by P.L. Vaidya (Buddhist Sanskrit Texts 7, Darbhanga 1967). It has been translated into English (including the quotations in our summary) by Megumu Honda in "Annotated translation of the Da?abh?mika S?tra (revised by Johannes Rahder)" in D. Sinor (ed.), Studies in South, East and Central Asia (presented to Prof. Raghu Vira) (New Delhi 1966), 115-276." ? see also for these references, BIPh 81.1.

For completing Rahder's bibliography on the Dutch Studies page, for the references:

? 1931 - ?The g?th?s of the Da?abh?mika S?tra (Gatha Portion).? The Eastern Buddhist (?).

It was a joint publication with Shinryu Susa, issued in two parts in the journal The Eastern Buddhist (Kyoto: Eastern Buddhist Society): pp. 335-359 for the [Part I]. The second part 'The g?th?s of the Da?abh?mika-S?tra (concluded)" was in The Eastern Buddhist VI, 1 ( April 1932) pp. 51-84.
