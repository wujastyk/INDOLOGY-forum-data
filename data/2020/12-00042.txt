Dear colleagues,
Starting academic next year, Ghent University will be offering its MA degree program in South Asian Languages and Cultures (the research-oriented track) online. Our program is especially interesting for students wishing to specialize in some of the classical languages of Jainism (including Prakrit and Apabhramsha) and Indo-Aryan linguistics.
More information is available on our website: www.india.ugent.be/home/eng<http://www.india.ugent.be/home/eng>.
For anyone interested in joining this program, please note the deadline of March 1st, 2021 to start the admission process.
Please feel free to share this information with any student who might be interested.
With best wishes,
Eva
