Dear Matthew,
If you press the "See other formats" button on the right side of the page (your link), it takes you to another page (below) with a very clear scan (to my eyes) from which you can download a pdf (second link).

Dear friends,
Just to clarify - I am looking for a scan of the article.
The version at
https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.280553/2015.280553.Journal-Of_djvu.txt
is useless for purposes of citation.
with thanks,
Matthew
