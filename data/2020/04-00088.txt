?bung macht den Meister - so let my try again:

?????????????????????? ? ?????????? ?
???? ?????????? ????? ??? ?? ???????????? ?

Did Rama the wise send none other than a monkey to Lanka

(Please note that I do not consider myself a pa??it or a kavi but rather 
a humble student of Sanskrit language and literature. I very much 
appreciate your patience with my sometimes faulty compositions as well 
as your improvements and the interesting discussions triggered by them.)
