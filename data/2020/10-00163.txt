Re: [INDOLOGY] Manusmriti ... (Olivelle, J P)
   Dear all,
   With regard to Manu and "women being prostitutes," and with respect and utter admiration for Prof. Olivelle, I would like to suggest that some ?lokas of the passages already mentioned suggest something beyond a simple "need to guard [women] from even the slightest attachment to sensual pleasure":
nait? r?pa? par?k?ante n?s?? vayasi sa?sthiti?
sur?pa? v? vir?pa? v? pum?n ity eva bhu?jate 
pau??caly?c calacitt?c ca naisnehy?c ca svabh?vata? 
rak?it? yatnato 'p?ha bhart??v et? vikurvate 
   In Prof. Olivelle's own translation ("they"=women, caps for emphasis mine):
"They pay no attention to beauty, they pay no heed to age; whether he is good looking or ugly, they make love to him with the single thought, "He's a man!" Because of the lechery, fickleness of mind, and hard-heartedness that are innate in them, EVEN WHEN THEY ARE CAREFULLY GUARDED IN THIS WORLD, they become hostile towards their husband"
   I would remark here that although "lechery" is of course entirely adequate, pau??calya>pu??-cal? is literally "one who runs after men," idiomatically and unequivocally a "prostitute," so perhaps something like "whorishness" or "sl at ttiness" may convey more directly the flavour of the Sanskrit word. 
   On a personal note, I feel the venerable Manu to be, without much exegesis or word-bending, pretty antagonistic to a modern feminist agenda, which I support.
   namaskaromi,
   Diego
