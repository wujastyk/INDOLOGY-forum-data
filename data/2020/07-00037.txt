restrictions to H1B visas (which most foreign academics come in on):

There was debate at one point that non-commercial organisations such as
universities would be excluded from this ban; but they are now in it, as
far as I know.
A step leading up to those restrictions was that the government got rid of
expedited processing for H1Bs (for a fee, a reply within a period of a few
weeks was guaranteed - which often was the only way to get a foreign
academic into the US in time for them to start their work on time/at the
beginning of the semester).
Not a good time, neither for people nor institutions.
