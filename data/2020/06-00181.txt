Dear Colleagues,
due to the current situation caused by the corona pandemic we have  
converted our summer school "Kannada as a Classical Language" into an  
online course. It will be conducted by Prof. B.A. Viveka Rai together  
with the Chair of Indology, University of W?rzburg, from 19th to 23rd  
October 2020, 3:00-6:30 p.m. CET.

This course focusses on the classical literary genre Champu. After an  
introduction into classical Kannada, Janna?s Yashodhara Charite  
(chapters 3 and 4) will be read and studied. Participants are expected  
to possess knowledge of fundamental grammar and the Kannada script  
before attending the course.

Prof. Dr. B.A. Viveka Rai is a retired professor of Kannada Literature  
and Folklore at the University of Mangalore. Since 2010, he is a  
regular guest professor at the Chair of Indology, University of  
W?rzburg, teaching Kannada and classical Kannada, as well as courses  
on the culture and literature of Karnataka.

There will be NO FEE. For any questions and for registration please  
write to Anna Aurelia Esposito (anna.esposito at uni-wuerzburg.de).

The course will be taught online. The access code will be communicated  
to the participants before the course.

We would be grateful if you could widely circulate this call for applications.

Best regards,
Anna Aurelia Esposito
