Respected Scholars,
The following lexica have been mentioned in Vogel.
If any one of you can help me locate some of these works, I would be
obliged.
I understand that some of these may be just manuscripts, never printed.
But I have not been conclusively able to rule out their publication, nor
have been able to access them.
