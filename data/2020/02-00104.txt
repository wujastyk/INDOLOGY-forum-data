[INDOLOGY] help with a name
Dear Jonathan,
In the Library of Congress database, the heading (or access point) for Har Dayal had been entered in inverted order, as ?Dayal, Har?. This was a legacy practice that is no longer in accordance with current cataloging practice for Indic names. We have now re-evaluated the heading and revised our records as following:
Main entry:        Har Dayal, Lala, 1884-1939
Variant forms:   Dayal, Har, 1884-1939
                                Dayal, Har, Lala, 1884-1939
                                Haradia?la, Lala, 1884-1939
                                Hardayal, Lala, 1884-1939
                                Har Dayal Singh Mathur, Lala, 1884-1939
                                Mathur, Har Dayal Singh, Lala, 1884-1939
FYI, we are treating ?Lala? as an honorific.
Thanks and regards,

[INDOLOGY] help with a name
Dear Colleagues
A colleague asked me a question that, rather than rush an answer, has made me turn to your collective wisdom.
I have been rather pedantic that Lokesh Chandra is one name, and thus not to be cited as Chandra, Lokesh. OK, I think this is completely correct (ditto for his father Ragu Vira, not Vira, Ragu).
My colleague however has asked me about Har Dayal. Wikipedia tells me that his name is Lala Har Dayal Singh Mathur. OK, but in English at least he published under Har Dayal, so my colleague's question is whether the "family name" is Dayal, or Har Dayal, or as I interpret the question, whether we should put reference in a bibliography as Dayal, Har, or rather Har Dayal.
Thank you for enlightening the ignorant!
