It is believed that, she was with husband without his knowledge for years. Even on his marriage occasion he was busy reading books. After years have elapsed, one night when&nbsp; he was writing a commentary on BS,&nbsp; there was a sudden darkness due to the lack of oil in the lamp. A lady came lit the fire. At that time VM realized he has a wife. He asks about how she managed to earn for living etc, later VM suggests his wife to leave.&nbsp;

Respected scholars,&nbsp;"Bhamati" written and composed by Bachaspati Misra&nbsp; , as a commentary on Shankaracharya' version of Brahma Sutra, takes it's name from&nbsp; his wife by the same name.It may be a curious query to search if any&nbsp; records exist about the person named Bhamati, Bachaspati Misra's wife? .... whether she played any significant role in helping her husband compose this Magnum Opus..
