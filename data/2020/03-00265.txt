[INDOLOGY] Retroflexion and gender in viruses
Good point. Since in Prakrit ? can represent a short vowel (admittedly, only before a double consonant), perhaps we can be flexible!
The other thing that came to mind is the initial consonant. ?? is correct, based on the Latin, but for those of us in the English speaking world, unvoiced stops are aspirated, so presumably what Madhav heard in San Jose was more like ??????! (An example of accommodating loanwords into native phonology - English has unaspirated, unvoiced stops, but only after s-, so initial k- is naturally borrowed as kh-.)
Best wishes

Re: [INDOLOGY] Retroflexion and gender in viruses
The other issue worth debating is the initial syllable  ??, which
should be long based on the script. In many other Indian languages,
both Dravidian and Indo-Aryan, the initial vowel is short:
???????????  ??????????? ??????????? ????? ?????  ????? ?????
???????????.  The short vowel seems more faithful to English
pronunciation and the Latin original (cor?na).  Is the spelling in
Devan?gar? based on the equivalency of o = ? (?).
All the Best,
