[INDOLOGY] sources for the idea that reincarnation is a semi-random process?
It's interesting (to me) to think about this issue you raise, James, of
taking reincarnation "as something that might be 'real' in the western
scientifically-oriented sense".  First, let's get rid of "western".
Everybody does science and has done for a couple of centuries, so it's been
global for a long time and I don't think you really mean to make a
statement about historical origins.  Moving on, the idea of equating
reality with scientific investigation is, at heart, a question about
pram??as, I think.  In his famous essay, ?The Purpose of Philosophy?,
Isaiah Berlin categorizes questions according to the means used to answer
them.  Questions may be solved by empirical means, by formal means (e.g.,
mathematics or chess).  But the third category is questions about which we
are uncertain about how to answer them.  Those are philosophical questions
(I would say, metaphysical questions).   So your proposal for examining
reincarnation scientifically could be restated as a call to consider it as
an empirical question, rather than as a formal or philosophical one.  That
means there should be some falsifiable criteria available for testing
conjectures.
Best,
Dominik
