It is really a sad news.
I was invited to IGNCA in 1996 and 1997 by Kapila
Vatsyayan and I stayed in IIC.  The new building of
IGNCA was on construction. Commuting from IIC
to IGNCA and occasiobal talks with Kapia are my
most valuable memory in India.
With best wishes,

Dear Colleagues,
We note with great sadness the passing of our friend and colleague Dr. Kapila Vatsyayan with whom nay of us have worked over the years. She was a mainstay in the cultural, artistic, literary world of traditional Indian Studies and a great institution builder through her  longstanding association with the IIC and her service as the founder of the IGNCA. She will be sorely missed.

The passing away of a doyen ... Dr. Kapila Vatsyayan. A void in the field of art.  We all have read and gained knowledge from her dynamic writings....  A great scholar who contributed immensely to the field of art.... May her noble soul attain Sadgati??
Thanks & Regards,
