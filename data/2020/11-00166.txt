[INDOLOGY] Academia.edu and privacy issues
This is worrying.  I've been getting Academia.edu "push" suggestions too,
but I haven't connected them with my emails.
Gmail emails are encrypted by default, end-to-end.  TLS encryption (as long
as the recipient has TLS too).  So Academia.edu can't see them.
Google searches are public (see the fascinating Seth
Stephens-Davidowitz, *Everybody
Lies*), but not *who* did the searching afaik.
It's hard to know how this is happening, but it is a bit creepy.  I'll ask
the Academia.edu people.
Best,
Dominik
