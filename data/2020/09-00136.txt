Dear Colleagues,

warm greetings.

I would like to let you know that the fourth volume of proceedings of the
?gama research seminars convened by the ?gama Research Group at the
Department of Buddhist Studies of the Dharma Drum Institute of Liberal Arts
has recently come out:

Bhikkhun? Dhammadinn? (ed.), *Research on the Sa?yukta-?gama* (Dharma Drum
Institute of Liberal Arts Research Series, 8), Taipei: Dharma Drum
Corporation, 2020, 1040pp., ISBN 9789575988593.

The seminar on the *Sa?yukta-?gama *was held in Buenos Aires in October
2018, organised by the ?gama Research Group and hosted by Fundaci?n
Bodhiy?na de la Argentina.

Here are the relevant links:

For orders via the Dharma Drum Publishing Corporation: https://
www.ddc.com.tw/book/detail.php?id=8014

BibliaImpex distribution: http://www.bibliaimpex.com

Kindly note that the publisher, Dharma Drum Corporation, is connected to
but independent from the Dharma Drum Institute of Liberal Arts. The book is
available for sale through their website or, probably slightly later this
year due to postal service disruption caused by the pandemic, via the
Indian distributor BibliaImpex.

With best wishes,

Bhikkhun? Dhammadinn?
