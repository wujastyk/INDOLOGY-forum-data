Re: [INDOLOGY] Metre of gop?-g?tam
A training to sing meters in this pattern as bhajan can be found here where Upadesa Saram by Ramana Maharshi is being sung with the title, "Learn to Chant Upadesa Saram"
https://www.sriramanamaharshi.org/resource_centre/learn-to-chant-upadesa-saram/<https://nam05.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sriramanamaharshi.org%2Fresource_centre%2Flearn-to-chant-upadesa-saram%2F&data=02%7C01%7Caleksandar.uskokov%40yale.edu%7Cc1460f5848cb4508ccba08d80ed5eea7%7Cdd8cbebb21394df8b4114e3e87abeb5c%7C0%7C0%7C637275659281118069&sdata=u2pLFJ3WHS7%2F0c3SIRKkJdC80PIToPGWLl%2FYIm5duh0%3D&reserved=0>
The same style is applicable to Gopee Geetam too.
Upadesa Saaram has no consistent gurulagu pattern. But the pattern of maatraa gaNas is uniform. 8 + 8 which comes under chaturasra gati Taala-wise.
Kanakamanjaree, Vainasam , Nirasikaa --all have the same 8 + 8  chaturasra gati rhythm.

The only consistency is the singing style. Meters are all variegated.

Re: [INDOLOGY] Metre of gop?-g?tam
The pattern here is
III UIU UIU IU
If you change the first two laghus into a guru , it turns into
UI UIU UIU IU
which can also be written as
UIU IU UIU IU
There is a repetition of  UIU IU
or there are two symmetrical halves  UIU IU and  UIU IU
UIU IU UIU IU is ???????
We can say that by replacing the initial guru of  ???????  with two laghus , we get ???????? .  This makes  ???????  and ???????? have the same singing pattern.
First UIU IU  in ????? ascending tone and second UIU IU in ?????? descending tone. / ????? ??? - ????? ???  \
In  ????????,  III UIU UIU IU is the same as  IIIU IU UIU IU and the singing is IIIU IU   in ????? ascending tone and  UIU IU in ?????? descending tone.
 / ??? ?????  - ????? ???  \  or  / ????? ???  - ????? ???  \
We have many such pairs.
??????????????????? changes into  ?????????????????? by replacing the initial guru of  ???????????????????   with two laghus , we get ?????????????????? . That is the reason why viraamasthaana shifts one number from  ??????????????????? to  ????????????????? .  Reason is the singing style and singing pattern.
That is the reason why in Telugu Satakams , they consider  inclusion of ??????????????????? and  ????????????????? both in the same s'atakam as no violation of uniformity of meter. Reason is the uniformity in singing style and singing pattern.
Same with ????????? and ???????? in Telugu. Replacing the initial guru of  ????????? with two laghus changes it into  ???????? . Here too, viraamasthaana of champakamaalaa is one number higher than that of utpalamaalaa.
That is the reason Gopee geetam is called geetam.

Thank you Aleksandar.  I've also been informed offlist that this meter  but with the names  R?jaha?s? and Vibh??a?? is in the  three volume 1959 edition published in Pune by Prasad Prakashan, with editors P. K. Gode and C. G. Karve. . I was looking in Apte's 1890 edition where it didn't appear.  Apparently the modern editors expanded  the metrical section.

Dear Harry,
Va???dhara in his comment on the first verse writes: kanakama?jar? na? ca rau lagau iti s?tr?t. The definition scans right, so to his mind the meter is Kanakama?jar?. I don?t know which s?tra he has in mind.

[INDOLOGY] Metre of gop?-g?tam
Dear list members,
Can anyone identify the meter of the gop?-g?tam (Bh?gavata X, chapter 31).
See this link: https://iskcondesiretree.com/page/gopi-gita<https://nam05.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fiskcondesiretree.com%2Fpage%2Fgopi-gita&data=02%7C01%7Caleksandar.uskokov%40yale.edu%7Cc1460f5848cb4508ccba08d80ed5eea7%7Cdd8cbebb21394df8b4114e3e87abeb5c%7C0%7C0%7C637275659281128064&sdata=CLBrhl%2FBarHQgMeEGwqXsOe7n4b0IXLRTO8CazIdbgk%3D&reserved=0>
It is 11 syllable's per line but as far as I can see it is different from the 11 syllable metres in Apte's dictionaries appendix.
Thanks,
