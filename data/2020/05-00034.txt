[INDOLOGY] Techniques of Blinding
Note that (beside the fact that one of the actors of the film, Irrfan Khan, recently died) the blinding with acid is the technique  recommended in A? 4,10.13 
(Tokunaga's input on GRETIL)
KAZ04.10.13/ ??drasya br?hma?a.v?dino deva.dravyam avast??ato r?ja.dvi??am ?di?ato dvi.netra.bhedina? ca yoga.a?janena^andhatvam, a??a.?ato v? da??a? //
(tr. R. Shamasastry  https://archive.org/details/Arthasastra_English_Translation <https://archive.org/details/Arthasastra_English_Translation> )
When a Sudra calls himself a Brahman, or when any person 
steals the property of gods, conspires against the king, or destroys 
both the eyes of another, he shall either have his eyes destroyed by 
the application of poisonous ointment, or pay a fine of 800 panas.
(Sorry, I have not Olivelle's translation at hand)
