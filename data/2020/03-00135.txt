[INDOLOGY] Nick Allen
I will miss Nick greatly too. I have known him for many years, and he was a good friend. I last saw him late last year in Oxford.
I entirely agree with the very positive comments people have been making. He was a warm, supportive and wise man, and I learned a lot from him.

Dear All,
Wonderful man. He came to a number of our conferences held in Dubrovnik on the epics and Pur??as, and made a great contribution.
Cheers,
