Subject: [INDOLOGY] Female poet-saints of India
Message-ID: <CAJ3b0o_CooxA6aX+LSgTMAbyxtybbZNSj9RDw7ps8KUgKTTdRw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list members,

I've been asked to find bhajans, dohe, abhangas and stotrams etc. of
femal poet-saints of India.  These can be in any Indian language. Any help
would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Harry Spier
