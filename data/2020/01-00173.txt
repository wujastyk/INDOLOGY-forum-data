[INDOLOGY] Some Ganesha gayatri mantras
Dear list members,
I've been asked to verify the authenticity of the following two Ganesha
gayatri mantras.  I.e. if they are not a modern creation. I haven't found
them in either Muktabodha or GRETIL libraries.  Would any of the list
members know a scriptural source or have heard these in a temple ceremony?
