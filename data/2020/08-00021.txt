[INDOLOGY] Question?
just for ease: https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k933053/f159.image
this is the beginning of the article mentioned.
Maybe I am quite entirely wrong, but are we not dealing with an old frozen
form with an old aluk-sam?sa in pl. gen? Lord of assemblies? (Cp. P's
singular)
again probably totally wrong...
