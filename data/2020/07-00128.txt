Johannes is right. I have a physical set of the 2nd printing of M?m??s?dar?ana in the Anandasrama series (various years, mostly or all in the 1970s). The pagination is different from the in the 1st printing. There are also new errors in the 2nd printing.

I wonder why they reset type as late as the 1970s when some sort of photographic copying of the first printing books would have been possible.

Happily, most or all of the first printing is available at archive.org <http://archive.org/>.

I have meanwhile found that this appears to be true of its editions of the Sarvadar?anasa?graha.

According to the title pages, edition (1) is the third impression (a?kan?v?tti), edition (2) the fourth. Edition (1) has been prepared (sa??odhita) by Vin?yaka Ga?e?a ?pa?e with the help of the Pandits of the ?nand??rama; edition (2) only by the Pandits of the ?nand??rama. The text of the Sarvadar?anasa?graha covers 171 pages in edition (1); 174 pages in edition (2). Both editions contain the same list of manuscripts (?dar?apustakollekhapatrik?; edition (2) contains its first mistake in this list, misnaming ms. gha as ba) and the same list of chapters (edition (1) calls it atha sarvadar?anasa?grah?ntargatadar?an?n?m anukrama?; edition (2) calls is anukrama?ik?). Edition (1) then has a preface to the second impression (dvit?y?v?ttisa?bandhi nivedanam) and an introduction (upodgh?ta); edition (2) has neither of these two.

This sometimes leads to confusion, as when the editors point out on p. 200 fn. 108 that the last p?da of a ?loka in the 1977 ?nand??rama edition (p. 152 l. 22) "erscheint ... nur verst?mmelt"; this is true, but this p?da is perfectly in order in the 1950 edition (p. 150 l. 12).
