[INDOLOGY] Anandasrama editions
Johannes is right. I have a physical set of the 2nd printing of M?m??s?dar?ana in the Anandasrama series (various years, mostly or all in the 1970s). The pagination is different from the in the 1st printing. There are also new errors in the 2nd printing.
I wonder why they reset type as late as the 1970s when some sort of photographic copying of the first printing books would have been possible.
Happily, most or all of the first printing is available at archive.org <http://archive.org/>.
