Not being an expert (especially not with scripts) I have often wondered 
about the same questions, and my tentative answers are similar to that 
of Richard. Especially in the case of the /anun?sika/, however, I think 
a certain ?conflict? may have been involved: some reciters (of some 
traditions) continued to nasalize the end of the vowel or to pronounce a 
uvular nasal [?] (as in Japanese), while others began to speak that 
sound as a /?/, which then became /?g/ or /?k/.

In order to avoid a cluster like /?ata*?g ?*??uy?ma, /they then added a 
vowel, perhaps it even was a /u/ (which to my knowledge was the 
successor of final /a/ some Prakrit dialects?). Possibly due to the 
influence of another tradition, an attempt was made to reconcile this 
?/a//?gu/? with the pronunciation of a simple nasalized /a/, and the 
result was this odd /g(u)? /sound ? the logic being that one didn't dare 
to simply drop the velar sound, because this is the way one had learned it.

... So much for my early morning speculations, now I'm looking forward 
to hearing more from others!

Best,

Dominik
