[INDOLOGY] Anniversary of INDOLOGY
Dear Dominik,
many thanks for having altruistically dedicated your time and energy to the
benefit of a community of scholars---thirty years ago as well as every
single day thereafter. And thanks also to the current and past members of
the management committee!
Best wishes,
elisa
