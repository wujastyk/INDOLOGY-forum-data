I am looking for a translation of the Ny?yaprave?a ? can?t find one on the internet. Does anyone know of a translation of this work and whether a pdf might be available? I need it to make sense of the 29th chapter of the Tamil Ma?im?kalai, a Buddhist work of the 6th (?) century with about 400 lines on Buddhist logic that closely resemble the NP. Thanks, George Hart
