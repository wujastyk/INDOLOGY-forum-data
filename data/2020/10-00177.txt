The 12th International Indology Graduate Research Symposium (IIGRS 12) 
will be held in Vienna, Austria, from July 22nd to 24th 2021. It is 
funded and organised by the Department of South Asian, Tibetan and 
Buddhist Studies (Institut f?r S?dasien-, Tibet- und Buddhismuskunde, 
ISTB) of the University of Vienna in collaboration with the Institute 
for the Cultural and Intellectual History of Asia (Institut f?r Kultur- 
und Geistesgeschichte Asiens, IKGA) of the Austrian Academy of Sciences.

The conveners of the Symposium invite you to submit proposals for a 
presentation of approximately 20 minutes. Please see the full call for 
papers in the attachment.

Let us also point out that the 26th European Conference on South Asian 
Studies (ECSAS 2021) will be held just after IIGRS 12 in Vienna, 26 ? 29 
July 2021. This will provide a convenient opportunity especially for 
young scholars to meet students and specialists of various fields of 
Indology. For more information on this conference visit
