[INDOLOGY] The study of Sanskrit as the epitome of uselessness
Speaking of my dear friend Lee Siegel: he often tells the story that he
only decided to study Sanskrit after hearing a speech of Richard Nixon the
California senator (before he became president), in which the latter
quipped that the University of California's budget should be slashed
because 'instead of doing anything useful, they are studying things like
Sanskrit'.
