> No 10-12-year-old is ready to be a mother in any real way -- physically
or in terms of maturation

The facts of the present speak against such an apodictically made
biological assertion:



https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_youngest_birth_mothers



https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy#cite_note-Teen_pregnancies_higher_in_India_than_even_UK,_US-115

[?In the Indian subcontinent, early marriage sometimes results in
adolescent pregnancy, particularly in rural regions where the rate is much
higher than it is in urbanized areas. Latest data suggests that teen
pregnancy in India is high with 62 pregnant teens out of every 1,000
women.?]



I sense a classic strategy of appropriation, which unconsciously subjects
everything to the yardstick of one's own, namely Western, culturally shaped
view and personal experience made in such environments. Especially when it
comes to historical issues, one can only warn against this. Views grounded
in our everyday experience in the West of the 21st century must not be
projected uncritically onto ?all cultures and epochs?. Studying ancient
India means studying the distant past of a very distant culture, which had
developed entirely independent of whatever ideas, values and lifestyle the
west might entertain today.

The topic of fertility in particular was ? understandably ? particularly
central in the older epochs of India, and the best sources for such
historical questions are not the normative legal texts, but the numerous
old Indian G?hyas?tras, which tradition counts among the Vedic auxiliary
literature. Together with the rich and extensive commentaries from the
Middle Ages, studied without bias, the broadly spread evidence can lead to
insights that may not necessarily meet modern expectations and wishful
thinking, but at least allow us to get closer to a reality that lies far
behind.


Kind regards,

WS
