Dear Finnian,

You might want to do a search in the Muktabodha digital library for
occurrences of o?k?ra o?k?ra aumk?ra and au?k?ra.

That can be done by going to the searchable library of etexts
http://muktalib5.org/digital_library_secure_entry.htm

and in the search field entering <oMkAr>|<oGkAr>|<auMkAr>|<auGkAr>
Its important to enter that exactly.  The angle brackets tell the search
engine you are using Harvard-Kyoto transliteration. The vertical bars mean
"or" and tell it to search for those different variations.  The "a" is left
off the end of the search string so you don't lose any occurrences through
sandhi changes.
