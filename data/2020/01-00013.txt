[INDOLOGY] (no subject)
Dear all
Dear all
I am attaching a pdf of Rgveda with newly developed Vedic fonts. For only
the first mantra I used double svara due to time constraints. Also to
indicate the padapatha I have used a gap similar to Satwalekar's editions.
Any changes required please let me know.
