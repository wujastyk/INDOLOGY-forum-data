Subject: [INDOLOGY] Lubotsky RV Concordance
Message-ID: <0b37cc08-3788-e792-515b-c33a7335858e@gmail.com>

Dear list,

does anybody know whether there exists an online-version of Lubotsky's 
two-volume "A Rgvedic Word Concordance"? Any hints (or Pdf...) would be 
highly appreciated.

Thanks and best

Tim
