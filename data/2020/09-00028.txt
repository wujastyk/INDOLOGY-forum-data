1) See *Richard Schmidt* (*Beitr?ge zur indischen Erotik*. 3. Aufl. Berlin
1922: 645?649) with source quotes on marriage age and also marks of
pubescence).
2) See moreover *Ram Gopal*, *India of Vedic Kalpas?tras*. Delhi 21983: 212
with relevant quotes (p. 220, n. 59) also on the important term *nagnik?*
(?naked?) in the context of the ideal marriage age:
*nagnik?m* [=] *apr?ptastr?bh?v?m* *ayauvanaras?m* *upayaccheta* (?let him
approach a *nagnik?* girl for intercourse in whom the sexual
characteristics of a woman are not yet developed and in whom the menstrual
fluid (*yauvanarasa*) has not yet emerged.?).
*nagnik?*, defined as the ?best? (*?re??h?*) in the above passage of
*M?navag?hyas?tra* as cited by Gopal, seems actually to refer to the
absence of pubic hair (*aj?talomn?*) as also discussed, e.g., by
Bha??an?r?ya?a on *Gobhilag?hyas?tra* 2.5.7. According to the latter?s
testimony there were ?c?ryas who stipulated intercourse with prepubescent
married girls lacking pubic hair, if these girls themselves desired so:
*yady aj?talomny ev?t?va puru??bhog?rthin? sy?t, tath? sati, *[?] *maithuna?
kartavyam ity eke ?c?ry? manyante*.
3) The Kashmirian *K??hakag?hyas?tra* determines the age of marriage of
girls at 10, at the very latest at 12 years (*da?av?r?ika?** brahmacarya?
kum?r???? dv?da?av?r?ika? v? *KGS 19.2), on which Devap?la comments:
*var?ada?ak?d
?rdhva? **brahmacarye kum?r? **na** sth?payitavy? pitr? **?* *agaty? **v?
dv?da?a **var???i n?tikrama??y?ni* ? (Devap?labh??ya *ad* 19.2. ||
4) *Manusm?ti*
*tri??advar?o vahet kany?? h?dy?? dv?da?av?r?ik?m | trya??avar?o '??avar???
v? dharme s?dati satvara?* || MDh? 9.94 ||
?A 30-year-old man should marry a charming girl of 12 years, or an
18-year-old, *a girl of 8 years* - *sooner, if* his fulfilling the Law
would suffer.? (Olivelle 2005, p. 194).
There is a wider range of evidence for an ideal marriage age for girls aged
8 (*a**??**avar**?**?*): To start with P?rvat?, ?iva?s wife, it is said
that she was married at the age of eight (8), i.e. before puberty, the
technical term for which is *gaur?* (significantly also used as an epithet
for her):
5) Jayadratha?s *Haracaritacint**?**ma**?**i*
*dev**?** himavata**?** putr**?** k**?**l**?** n**?**lotpalacchavi**?** | *

*s? kr??ant? pit?gehe ?ambhun? saha p?rvat?* |
*d???v? d???v? vapu? ?y?ma? n?ha? gaur?ty alajjata* || Hc 22.4 ||
6) *gaur?* = *a??avar??* = prepubescent:
*Brhadyamasmrti* (= *Par??arasm?ti* 7.4):
*a??avar??** bhaved gaur? navavar?? ca rohi?? |*
*da?avar?? bhavet kany?  ata ?rdhva? rajasval?* || YS 182v 3.21 ||
7) *A??avar??* marriage in the *Rev?kha??a* of the *V?yupur??a*:
*pu?y?ham adya sa?j?tam aha? tvaddar?anotsuka? |*
*kany?** mad?y? r?jendra hy a??avar?? vyaj?yata* || RKV 142.18 ||
[?]
*caturbhujo mama sutas tri?u loke?u vi?ruta? | tasyeya? d?yat?? kany?
?i?up?lasya bh??maka* || RKV 142.20 ||
8) *R?m?ya?a*
S?t?, too, was married before the age of puberty as a ?*kaum?r?*?:
*svaya? tu bh?ry?? kaum?r?? ciram adhyu?it?? sat?m |*
*?ail??a iva m?? r?ma parebhyo d?tum icchasi* || R?m 2.27.8 (CE)||
The G?t? Press translates from an emic insight point of view: ?who was
married to you before puberty?.
The commentaries *R?m?ya?a?iroma?i* und *Bh??a?a* on this passage (R?m
2.30,8) confirm *kaum?r?* as ?*kum?r?vasth?y?? eva viv?hit?*? (?married
already in the period of life of a ten to twelve years old maiden?).
*kum?r?* = 1. ?A young girl, one from 10 to 12 years old? (Apte)
9) A significant term for a a sexually mature, fully developed girl is
*prau?h?* (cp., eg., *Bh?gavatapur??a *4.25.21 (*a-prau?h?* ? ?not yet
fully developed?), or *??h?* (cp. *nava-??h?* ? ?having just attained
puberty?, as in *Brahmavaivartap*., ch. 112).
