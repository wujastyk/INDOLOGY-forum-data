Dear folks,
Does anybody have a pdf of Sandal?s introduction of volume 1 in Mimamsa Sutras of Jaimini, Motilal Banarsidass 1980?
Seems impossible to buy a copy of the book.
or,
Is this identically with Sandal?s Introduction in M?m?s? S?tras of Jaimini, 1925? I do have a reprint of the latter.
Kind regards,
Jon Skarpeid
