Dear Alakendu Das,
First, may I suggest that you use the International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration for writing Sanskrit words? This is what Indologists are accustomed to. Thus, your vigyan would be written as vij??na.
As you noted in your query of Nov. 13, the meaning of vij??na

 in Buddhist texts somewhat differs from its meaning in Hindu texts. In both cases, the meaning of 
vij??na comes out in juxtaposition with j??na. An article on this by Franklin Edgerton was published in 1933, "J??na&nbsp; and 
vij??na," drawing on Hindu texts. I have scanned my photocopy of it and attached a PDF of the scan.
Best regards,
David ReigleColorado, U.S.A.
