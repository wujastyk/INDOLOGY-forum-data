[INDOLOGY] Retroflexion and gender in viruses
That is, writing Sanskrit - not Hindi -  we should prefer the spelling 
??????. With the nirukti kora-?na this would denote something even less 
or smaller than a bud, no?
Regarding Bh?maha, most of us would still prefer a grammatical error to 
a virus infection, I guess:
??? ????????? ?????? ??????? ?? ????????? ?
????????????????? ??? ??????? ????????? ?
????????????????? ??????? ????????? ?
"A stanza a day keeps the virus away --
even if there may be a grammatical error, which can easily be 
corrected."
This was said by a friend of the kavis secluded in his own house.
Just my two (and a half) cents.
Best,
