[INDOLOGY] source(s) of a stanza
Dear colleagues,
Can anyone help me identify a Sm?ti source for this stanza?
str???m av?cyade?asya klinnan???vra?asya ca |
abhede 'pi manobhed?j jana? pr?ye?a va?cyate ||
I have an e-text of Vidy?ra?ya's J?vanmuktiviveka which says:
39. tath? ca sm?tibhir jugups? var?it?:
str???m av?cyade?asya klinnan???vra?asya ca |
abhede 'pi manobhed?j jana? pr?ye?a va?cyate || [NpU p. 160]
But I don't know which text is intended with "NpU" and anyhow would like to know if the stanza is attested more broadly.
I don't mean any offense in drawing attention to this stanza. I ask only because it happens to be transmitted on Bali in the S?rasamuccaya (stanza 89 in Raghu Vira's edition).
Thanks!
Arlo Griffiths
