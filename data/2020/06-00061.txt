[INDOLOGY] Buddhist Beliefs?
My apologies for cross-posting.
I have been looking for statistical surveys of Buddhist beliefs. So far, apart from general discussions in Spiro, I have only been able to find Todd Lewis' 1996 survey of Buddhist beliefs among Newars. Specifically, I am looking for surveys of any Buddhist population concerning what percentage of them are aware of specific doctrines such as anatman, karma, etc. Given the mountain of literature on Buddhist beliefs, I had expected to find a lot of such surveys. Somehow I must be using the wrong search terms, so any suggestions or recommendations would be greatly appreciated.
Be well,
