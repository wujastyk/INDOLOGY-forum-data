Thank you, Vincent. Perhaps I may add an anecdote to remember Stefano. Prior to his illustrious career as a scholar of Buddhism, when he was still a student in Beijing, Stefano had a short, but quite successful career as an actor in Chinese movies. 
Best wishes,
Eli

Besides offering me the privilege of reading Kum?raj?va?s translations once a week (via Skype, already), he had been patiently answering all my questions with the wealth and breadth of textual, philological and linguistic information that characterized him. Stefano certainly was, at least in Europe and in America, the highest authority on Buddhist Chinese, but one could only be struck by his humility towards a(?) language the study of which was, in his opinion, still in its infancy and could bring much to the historical understanding of the evolution of literary Chinese. There was not a book or an opinion he was not aware of ? Stefano often quoted the much missed Seishi Karashima?s ideas on the meaning of such and such a word or the proper interpretation of such and such a grammatical or syntactic feature. He was one of the most generous and humble persons I have ever met with in this field, one of the sweetest, too, a highly learned man to whom nothing was indifferent, and who took delight in the conversations he had with his fellows at Balliol College, Oxford, more often than not with specialists of entirely different fields of research. The very idea of a border was something decidedly unintelligible and indecent to him. Although Stefano was deeply in love with his birthplace in the mountainous regions of northern Italy, he was, like any respectable person, a cosmopolitan mind who regarded Brexit and other eruptions of nationalistic pride as the most perfect expressions of stupidity and narrow-mindedness.

He was almost my age, and for the first time in this terrific, not to say apocalyptic period, I have been able to see myself dead. It could just have been me. Unfortunately, it was him, and many of us in the field of Buddhist Studies are going to mourn his passing for the rest of our fragile lives.
