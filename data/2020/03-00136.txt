*The Secret History* by Donna Tartt

p. 50

"You get along with Henry?
 "Oh, sure thing," said Bunny, reared back in his chair. "We were
roommates. Freshman year."
"And you like him?"
"Certainly, certainly. He's a hard fellow to live with though. Hates noise,
hates company, hates mess. None of this brining your date back to the room
to listen to a couple Art Pepper records, if you know what I'm trying to
get at."
"I think he's sort of rude."
Buddy shrugged. "That's his way. See, his mind doesn't work the same way
yours and mine do. He's always up in the clouds with Plato or something.
Works too hard, takes himself too seriously, studying Sanskrit and Coptic
and those other nutty languages. Henry, I tell him, if you're going to
waste your time learning something besides Greek -- that and the King's
English are all I think a man *needs*, personally -- why don't you buy
yourself some Berlitz records and brush up on your French. Find a little
can-can girl or something. Voolay-voo coushay avec moi and all that."
"How many languages does he know?"
"I lost count. Seven or eight. He can read *hieroglyphics.*"
"Wow."
Bunny shook his head fondly. "He's a genius, that boy. He could be a
translator for the UN if he wanted to be."
"Where's he from?"
"Missouri."


p. 356 also has a [not historically great] description of Buddhist Tantra.
