Dear List members,

I am looking for an electronic copy of:
John C. Powers ?The Ultimate (don dam pa, param?rtha) in the S?tra
Explaining the Thought (Sa?dhinirmocana-s?tra): Study, Translation, and
Notes? (vols. 1-2), doctoral dissertation, University of Virginia (1991).

I wonder if anyone might have it and would be willing to share it with me?

I have access to later Powers' works on the *Sa?dhinirmocana*, but I
require that more academic version of the translation.

Kind regards,
Gleb Sharygin
