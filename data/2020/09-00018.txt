Dear Akalendu Das,

Thank you for your response.

Unless I am mistaken, the figures you name are all either post-11th century, or - like Mandana and Suresvara - directly connected with Sankara's tradition. And I think all those you mention are in any case Vedantins.

What I was asking about, however, concerned responses to Sankara from representatives of other schools of thought.
These seem striking by their absence.

with best regards,

Dr.Kapstein.
The period which you referred i.e.9th-11th Century is significant indeed.This was the span of time which produced hordes of philosophers who were Post Sankara and deviated from Sankara's philosophy, in the form of Ramanuja,Maddhacharya, Nimbarka, Ballabhacharya etc.This has been beautifully elucidated by Madhavacharya in SarvaDarshanSamgraha.The philosophy they preached was either qualified Monism or Dualism.On the other hand, we also had Mandana Misra, Sureshwaracharya, Vimuktatmana and Madhusudan Saraswati, who strengthened the foundation of Absolute Monism, as laid down by Sankara.
However,the earliest Philosopher who was a critic of Sankara philosophy was Bhaskara in the 9th Century about whom not much is known.
Can anybody may kindly throw some light on Bhaskara's philosophy and his deviation from that of Sankara's?

Alakendu Das.

Dear friends,

Your discussion calls to mind a somewhat broader question: what do we know of the reception of ?a?karaved?nta beyond that tradition itself, particularly during the 9th-11th centuries? The absence of engagement, positive or negative, by others seems puzzling, no?

I will be most interested if you know of any work on this.

Thanks in advance,
Matthew

Thanks, Mrinal, for this clarification.  This question came up because we have recently joined a Marathi discussion group, where we are reading the ?????????, a philosophical work of ??????????, and the person who is leading the discussion is mixing up the ???kara Advaita with Kashmiri ?aivism.  However, it seems to me that J??ne?vara's own work, along with his more well known commentary on the Bhagavadg?t?, the J??ne?var? alias Bh?v?rthad?pik?, are syncretic works. J??ne?vara's guru is his own elder brother Nivr?ttin?tha belonging to the N?tha tradition.  So it appears that a brand of Kashmir ?aivism percolated into Maharashtra through the N?tha tradition and it got syncretized with ???kara Advaita and Bhakti traditions.  I am myself just at the beginning stages of sorting all this out, and I would appreciate any suggestions.  With best wishes,

Dear Prof Deshpande,

This is a problematic question. ?a?kara is completely unknown to the authors of non-dual ?aivism or even the dual ?iddh?nta ?aivism. In fact Utpala and Abhinava are using the 'advaita' of Bhart?hari to encounter the 'advaita' of Vij??nav?da Buddhists to establish their own 'advaita' point. So Ved?nta at large and particularly ?a?kara is nowhere in the picture. There is a very nice preface written by Prof Ambikadatta Sharma to the book of Prof Navjivan Rastogi titled 'Abhinavagupta k? tantr?gam?ya dharma-dar?ana' (2013) where he philosophically engages with this question mentioning why historically speaking ?a?kara does not become important in the case of ?aiva schools of Kashmir, both dual or non-dual.

Having said that, there certainly are references here and there to ??ntabrahmav?dins, but mostly they are passing references. Ved?ntins have never been important for ?aivas. However, I do think there should be a study that clearly reflects upon the two non-dual positions. I am saying this because I have myself seen in my own teaching practice that how easy is it to slip into the shoe of ?a?kar's advaita when one is teaching Abhinava, for instance. I am trying to work on something. Let us see if I can finish it sooner than later.

Best wishes.
