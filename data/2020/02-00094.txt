[INDOLOGY] help with a name
Dear Colleagues
A colleague asked me a question that, rather than rush an answer, has made
me turn to your collective wisdom.
I have been rather pedantic that Lokesh Chandra is one name, and thus not
to be cited as Chandra, Lokesh. OK, I think this is completely correct
(ditto for his father Ragu Vira, not Vira, Ragu).
My colleague however has asked me about Har Dayal. Wikipedia tells me that
his name is Lala Har Dayal Singh Mathur. OK, but in English at least he
published under Har Dayal, so my colleague's question is whether the
"family name" is Dayal, or Har Dayal, or as I interpret the question,
whether we should put reference in a bibliography as Dayal, Har, or rather
Har Dayal.
Thank you for enlightening the ignorant!
