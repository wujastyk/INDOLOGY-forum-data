Dear all,
Tall ask, but one never knows with this kalpataru:
Would anyone have a soft copy (interlibary loans being impossible with libraries shut...) of
N?tya??stra of Bharata, with the Abhinavabh?rati of Abhinavagupta, v. 1, 4th ed. Ed. K. Krishnamoorthy. Baroda: Oriental Institute, 1992?
Thank you,
