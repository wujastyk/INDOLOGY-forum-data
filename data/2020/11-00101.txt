This is very saddening. I first met Ram on my very first trip to India, back in 1979. Our contact lessened in later years because I shifted away from Tamil towards Kannada studies (his consort Jayalakshmi gave me my first Kannada novels, and I still have the congratulatory telegram he sent me ? in the pre-internet age ? when I got my doctorate), yet I owe him a great deal, mainly indirectly, but importantly. He was a highly supportive, exemplarily open-minded, enthusing person, and he will indeed be sorely missed.

He was a brilliant person, brimming with intelligence, opinions, and energy.  He did so much for Tamil language, culture and Indian culture as a whole.  He will be missed, indeed.
