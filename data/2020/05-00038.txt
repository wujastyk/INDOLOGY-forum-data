[INDOLOGY] Techniques of Blinding
The passage talking about the substance resulting from a mixture of
specific bird droppings with specific plant saps only says that it causes
blindness (*andh?kara?am a?janam*):
*??rik?-kapota-baka-bal?k?-le??am arka-ak?i-p?luka-snuhi-k??rapi??am
andh?kara?am a?janam udakad??a?a? ca* || (A? 14,1.15)
?Dung of Myrna bird, pigeon, Baka-heron, Bal?k?-flamingo, made into a paste
with the milk of the plants Arka, Ak?i, P?luka, and Snuhi, produces a
collyrium that causes blindness and poisons water? (Olivelle 2013: 422)
The two translators refer to this *andh?kara?a a?jana* with a view to
establishing the meaning of *yog??jana* in A? 4,10.13.
As an interim summary let it be noted that
first, only (4 species of) birds are enumerated in this context. Their
droppings have high uric *acid* levels.
Second, the sap of the two identified plants (of altogether 4 plant
species), *arka* and *snuhi*, are spoken of as ?*corrosive*? (*arka*) and ?
*caustic*? (*snuhi*).
This is what the Wikipedia has to say about the spurge: ?The milky sap of
spurges (called ?latex?)? is said to have ?caustic effects?: ?In contact
with mucous membranes (eyes, nose, mouth), the latex can produce extremely
painful inflammation. The sap has also been known to cause mild to extreme
Keratouveitis, which affects vision. [?] wearing eye protection while
working in close contact with *Euphorbia* is advised. [?] *severe eye
damage including permanent blindness* may result from exposure to the sap.?
What effect would a conglomerate of highly acidic bird droppings and
caustic plant saps exercise on the unprotected eye? The notion of
?poisoning? is less likely than that of causing severe burns. So far
everything points therefore to "acid" as the technique of blinding
recommended in the A?, as spontaneously suggested by Christophe Vielle.
