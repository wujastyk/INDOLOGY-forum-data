Subject: [INDOLOGY] Retroflexion and gender in viruses

Thanks a lot - k?ubhn?ti is close, though there is also a morphological break of a different sort there, I suppose. And I think there are no other words in that ga?a where we are dealing with an exception to nati within a word, it is all (except k?ubh-n?) about words that don't have nati when in compound. The ga?a as a whole appears to be a list of inexplicable exceptions to the general rules, but there is nothing quite like Korona.

I think people adapt borrowings to the constraints of their native phonology. P??ini would have been able to pronounce it Korona with dental, but if the rules of Sanskrit do not allow exceptions to nati in monomorphemic stems, and only rarely in morphologically complex stems, Korona would be alien to the natural rules of Sanskrit. But perhaps with such an awful thing it's better to keep it alien!

Are there any examples of post-P??inian borrowings into Sanskrit, preferably unsegmentable nominal stems, where nati was not applied according to the regular rules?

Best wishes,
John

I don't know what P??ini would have done, koro??/koron?, masculine or feminine.  There are exceptions to the retroflexion rules even in single words  [as ???????????? ? ??????. ? ??? ??????? ???????? ???????? ????? ??????? ??????? ???????? ? ????? ???????????].  In any case, importing an expression from a modern language into Sanskrit, one represents it as one hears it around.  Around me here in San Jose, I don't hear the retroflex.  But either representation is fine with me.  In early Marathi writings, the name of Mountstuart Elphinstone was written as ????? ?????????? ??????????.  In more recent Marathi writings, I see ???? ???????? ??????????, and the more Apabhramsha version was known as ?????? ?????. I write ????????????.  No retroflexion there.

That is, writing Sanskrit - not Hindi -  we should prefer the spelling
??????. With the nirukti kora-?na this would denote something even less
or smaller than a bud, no?

Regarding Bh?maha, most of us would still prefer a grammatical error to
a virus infection, I guess:

??? ????????? ?????? ??????? ?? ????????? ?
????????????????? ??? ??????? ????????? ?
????????????????? ??????? ????????? ?

"A stanza a day keeps the virus away --
even if there may be a grammatical error, which can easily be
corrected."
This was said by a friend of the kavis secluded in his own house.

Just my two (and a half) cents.
