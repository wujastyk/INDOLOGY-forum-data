[INDOLOGY] PDF Request: Vajracharya's "Crown Jewel of Newar Painting"
Dear all,
Would anyone happen to have a pdf of Gautama Vajracharya?s ?Crown Jewel of Newar Painting: Discovery of a Masterpiece,? which is found in Pratapaditya Pal?s Nepal: Old Images, New Insights? I actually have a copy myself, but it's inaccessible to me at the moment. 
Many thanks in advance,
Ryan
