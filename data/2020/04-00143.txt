[INDOLOGY] Mayavada (was Lines to an Advaitin)
Dear Bh?skarites,
I was just notified by Professor Kato (The University of Tokyo) that he is
still working on the completion Bh?skara's commentary.
On a related note I am copying below an earlier mail of mine, which was
held "until the list moderator can review it for approval (too many
recipients to the message)". Here it is:
Some might find it possibly helpful to consult almost all of Hacker's
seminal Ved?nta studies (except for his monographs) in the English language
as assembled and edited by Wilhelm Halbfass in this volume:
Philology and Confrontation. Paul Hacker on Traditional and Modern Vedanta.
Edited by Wilhelm Halbfass. New York: SUNY Press 1995.
See there in particular: "Distinctive Features of the Doctrine and
Terminology of ?a?kara: Avidy?, N?mar?pa, M?y?, ??vara." (pp. 57-100).
Kind regards,
Walter Slaje
