[INDOLOGY] a woman marrying a calf
Dear Professor Tieken,
/// a story (with versions in Chinese and Japanese), in which a princess marries a calf (young cow). /// 
There is a reference in one of the Old Tamil / Sangam Tamil poems, Kalittokai (?????????), about a buffalo (??????? ????) and a woman?s wedding. Please take a deep look at kalittokai 114:12-14.
I think it was symbolic in some cultures to have some sort of ritual like this ? to involve a bovine as a part of a wedding ceremony.
Since I?m not a socio-anthro specialist, I leave it up to you to figure out what the kalittokai poem refers to. I don?t have my reference books any more, so I couldn?t delve deep into any analysis.
Thanks and regards,
rajam
