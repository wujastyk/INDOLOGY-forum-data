=?utf-8?Q?[INDOLOGY]_satyakriy=C4=81_gesture?=
Dear listmembers,
For the interpretation of a J?taka mural I am in search for a 
description of a satyakriy? with additional details regarding specific 
gestures that have to be observed (during a satyakriy?), for example 
raised arms etc.
I checked the extensive secondary literatur without success. Not 
available for me is Thompson 1998 IIJ.
 ?Anyone can help?
Regards
Heiner
