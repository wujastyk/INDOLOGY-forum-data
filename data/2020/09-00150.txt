[INDOLOGY] MacDevnag on 64-bit systems
Dear Tim,
You can use RomDev available at https://indology.info/etexts/archive/soft/ <https://indology.info/etexts/archive/soft/> and MacTex/TexLive mentioned in Dominik?s posting. I have been using these on a Mac since 2013, when I could not coax MacDevnag and TexLive to produce texts longer than 2 or 3 pages. I also found articles at https://cikitsa.blogspot.com <https://cikitsa.blogspot.com/> (Dominik?s site).
Best,
Elliot
