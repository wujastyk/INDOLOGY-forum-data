[INDOLOGY] poison
dear Colleagues
Thanks to all of you who have contributed so much to helping Prof Ramble
try to localize his Tibetan text. His preliminary conclusion is that while
the text's author(s) knew Indian ideas, it's a text composed in Tibet. No
doubt in the future there will be much more to say about the possible
connections of this sort of "technical" knowledge transfer, enriching our
understanding on both sides of the Himalayas.
very warmest thanks to all, Jonathan
