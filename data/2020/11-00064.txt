[INDOLOGY] [External] Re: sources for the idea that reincarnation is a semi-random process?
It may be worth noting that the ?Freudian? aspects of rebirth were described in the Saddharmasm?tyupasth?na-s?tra translation attributed to Gautama Praj??ruci and said to be completed between 538-541 CE.
Arthur Waley had already identified it and translated the section in Edward Conze, ed. Buddhist Text Through the Ages, Oxford: Bruno Cassirer, 1954, p. 283. This references T.721.17.200c13-28. Waley did identify the Abhidharmako?a as a source as well.
Given its articulation in two sources translated into Chinese within a few decades of each other (the Abhidharmako?a is said to be first translated by Param?rtha 563-568 CE), it is possible to hypothesize that the idea could be older than either text.

Dear Matthew,
It all goes back to the Abhidharmakosabhasya. See AKBh on AK 3.15ab,
but Pradhan's edition has a lacuna here. Therefore:
dLVP, vol. 3, p. 50.

The "Freudian-like" aspect of the rebirth process in Buddhist
tantric sources is well-known. I do not recall whether Jung takes it
up in his introduction to the Tibetan "Book of the Dead", the Bar do
thos grol, but Indian Buddhist materials clearly reference this as
well. A brief but important study is Filliozat's:

Unfortunately, a pdf does not seem to be readily available.
Guy Bugault has studied the antecedents:

Hi Dean
Great question. Back in the 1990s we read a Tibetan medical text
with Bob Thurman at Columbia (some of my fellow students at the time
might remember the title) and it had an interesting bit on
reincarnation, with the incarnator feeling Freudian-like sexual
attraction towards the new mother if being born as a male, or
towards the new father if being born as a female, and seeing the
house as a palace regardless of its actual appearance. If I recall
correctly there was something in the text about the incarnator's
karma playing a key role in the parental/home selection/perception,
and there may have been something there about a certain randomness
or uncertainty in the process that may be relevant to your question.
Cheers

Dear Dean,
another aspect may be helpful:
because I am doing some research on the concept of karman and hell,
I see that already in the Gilgit-manuscripts (?yu?paryantas?tra)  a
systematically composed description (Sanskrit-?loka) connects
specific actions (karman) with the rebirth in certain hells.
When someone kills his mother his rebirth takes place in hell 1. If
he is a robber in hell 8 etc.
This description is adapted in several later works and found also
his way, probably via Burmese monks, in the later Pali-literature
and is still observed in Thailand, Sri Lanka etc.
I did not translate the complete ?yu?paryantas?tra. If you can read
Sanskrit (there is also a Tibetan translation) you may find the
answer of your question beyond the rebirth in a hell.

Dear Dean,
Not sure if the following is relevant to you query.
The idea that good karman doesn?t invariably immediately lead to
pleasant rebirth and bad karman doesn?t invariably immediately lead
to unpleasant rebirth is discussed in the Mahakammavibha?ga-sutta
(MN III 207?15, with parallels surviving in Chinese and Tibetan
translation).
Later Buddhist systematic thought in the Abhidharma traditions of
both the Therav?da and Sarv?stiv?da refers to the following
categories of karman in the context of determining which of a
being's infinite past actions might determine rebirth:
weighty (garuka/guru)
near to death (?sanna)
habitual (?ci??a/abhyasta)
something previously done (ka?att?kamma/p?rvak?ta)
See e.g. Vism 601?602 (XIX.14?16), Abhidh-k-bh (Pradhan) 477,
Abhidh-k-vy (Wogihara) 719.
In other words, if you have done something really ?weighty' in this
life (killed your mother or father, etc.) you're going to experience
the unpleasant results in your next rebirth come what may. If you
haven?t done anything weighty (most of us?), then either something
done close to the time of death or something done habitually will
tend to come into play (there is some hesitation in the sources on
whether to give precedence to near-death actions or habitual
actions). Failing these two, then any past action from any past life
may, depending on a variety of conditions, come into play. The
sources add that only buddhas can really see and understand the
complex of conditions that govern which karman ripens when. Thus
from the perspective of ordinary folk it may appear random, but from
the perspective of a buddha it is not.

Rupert

Dear fellow members of the Indology list,
Most people think of reincarnation being a somewhat deterministic
process based on past karma.
I read someplace, however, that Tibetans, and maybe other Buddhists,
consider the process of assigning one's karma for the next life as
something akin to reaching into a box of chips and grabbing a random
collection of karmas that set in motion the next life. Thus, it is
not so strictly deterministic.
I'm sorry if I'm not describing this accurately.
Can anyone point me to some original sources or commentaries for this idea ?
Also, is this something that is mentioned in Hinduism or other
reincarnation-based religions?

Dean Anderson
