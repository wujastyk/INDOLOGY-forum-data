[INDOLOGY] Question
Dear Madhav,
Here in the R?p?vat?ra the paradigme of pratibh?- masc. (p. 56)
https://archive.org/details/Rupavatara_of_Dharmakirti_M_Rangacharya_1927/page/n87/mode/2up
The word is not given with the fem. in ? (cf. p. 71)
https://archive.org/details/Rupavatara_of_Dharmakirti_M_Rangacharya_1927/page/n101/mode/2up
The treatment you propose for its possible fem. usage (that is like subhr?) sounds logical. However, in his grammar (following the Siddhar?pam, a work consisting in a simple list of paradigms, presenting slight variants according to its different editions), Hanxleden says:
bhr? "like ?r?", so with the alternative forms dat. sg. bhruvai, bhruve etc. (so idem subhr?)
but
var??bh?, punarbh? "like kartr?". So var??bhvai, punarbhvai only (what is seen in the Siddh. eds).
pratibh?- fem. should be declined accordingly.
On these problems, see also Renou Grammaire pp. 325-26
