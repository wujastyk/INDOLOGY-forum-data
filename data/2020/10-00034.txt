First thank you everyone for this discussion.
1) I've just had a quick look at the first verse of the Rudram, which
is  taittir?ya-sa?hit?
book 4 chapter 5 verse 1 and in addition to before  semivowels, sibilants
and h,  it looks like  in taittiriya texts gumkara is sometimes pronounced
before the vowel u and sometimes not?
See these lines from the verse TS 4.5.1
nama'ste a*stu* danv'ane *b?*hubhy?'m *u*ta *te* nama? |
vi'jy*a?* dhana'? ka*pa*rdi*no* vi?a'l*yo* ba?a'v?(gum) *u*ta |
*u*bh?by?'m *u*ta *te* namo' *b?*hu*bhy?*? ta*va* dhanva'ne |
2) I've also listened to some recordings I have of taittir?ya priests from
Satara, Maharashtra, reciting.
When they chant ga??n?m tv? ga?apatim hav?mahe as the introductory line to g
a?apati-atharva??r?a-stotram, they pronounce it without the gumkara as: ga??n?m
tv? ga?apati? hav?mahe but when they recite the same line as an
introductory line to the taittir?ya rudram, they do pronounce the gumkara.
They chant:   ga??n?m tv? ga?apati*gum* hav?mahe . When these same priests
recite the bhagavadg?t? they pronounce anusvara in the non-vedic way
without gumkara anywhere.
Thanks,
Harry Spier
