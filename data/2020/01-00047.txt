Dear friends,
I am searching for S?ya?a's commentary to V?jasaney? Sa?hit? 10.28, and 
since I am travelling at the moment and do not have access to a library, 
I will try my luck here instead. I have the following translation from 
Panduranga Bhatta's "Dice-Play in Sanskrit Literature" (Delhi, 1985), 
but I need to check it against the original Sanskrit:
"The game is played with five dice, four of which are called k?ta, 
whilst the fifth is called kali. If all the dice fall uniformly 
(ekar?pa), i.e. with the marked sides either upwards or downwards then 
the player wins, and in that case kali is said to overrule the other 
dice." (p. 80)
Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Best regards,
Jacob
