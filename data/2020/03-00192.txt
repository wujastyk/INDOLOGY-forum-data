[INDOLOGY] A distraction from the Coronavirus
Measuring number of claps, correlating with the number of pandas, what is
all this ? If you are sincere in encouraging ' his first attempts at
composing Sanskrit verses  ' ( I didn't know any such details about the
poet ) do not drag this twisted discussion beyond this point. Please help
the poet through some constructive criticism from your side, without
involving comments of others made with good intentions.
Sorry, Dr (?) Christian Ferstl for engaging with such unwarranted
discussion. I am sure you will understand my true appreciation of your
poetic skills.
