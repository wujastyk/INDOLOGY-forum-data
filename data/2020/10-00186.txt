[INDOLOGY] Manusmriti ... (Olivelle, J P)
Dear Colleagues,
I would be the last to give the Manusmriti a clean chit or reproach a stance against it. Nevertheless, the politics of Tamil Nadu are torturous and complicated and some issues - the Manusmriti among them - tend to be pulled up at strategic moments in the long history of Dravidian politics  and waved like red flags by men wanting as usual to decide what they need to get indignant about when it comes to ?their mothers, sisters and daughters?. Right now it has become part of the ugly fight between Hindutva forces and those which oppose it. This being said, I  don?t see Professor Rajam as a person who takes a politically aggressive stance against Dalit politics or Thol. Thirumaavalavan. Above all, I don?t think she should be condescended to. 
Kind regards,
Srilata Raman
