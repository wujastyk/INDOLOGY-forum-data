Message-ID: <CAJ3b0o-qVf7q2X4bxmMjU22ShLk+qL5sTNO7i-1guZXt5a2+gg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list members,
I've been asked to find the source of the following verses and also to
enquire if anyone knows of any pujas or temple ceremonies these are used in.

karp?ragaura? karu??vat?ra?

sa?s?ras?ra? bhujagendrah?ra?

sad? vasanta? h?day?ravinde

bhava? bhav?n? sahita? nam?m?


karp?rap?re?a manohare?a

suvar?ap?trodaka sam?thitena

prad?ptav?s?sahasa?gatena

nir?jana? te jagad??a kurve


Thanks,

Harry Spier
