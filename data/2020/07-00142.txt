Subject: [INDOLOGY] Google's Devanagari OCR
Message-ID: <CAB3-dze-TkSdq68-de9i4d5n0ER_kUFgRj2WHnU+Qp1HewWOJA@mail.gmail.com>

I was searching on Google if any text used form ?????, and it pointed me to
this page of the digitized copy of the book Ti?nt?r?avatara?i:

The form on this page is actually ???????, but obviously the OCR didn't or
couldn't distinguish between ????? and ???????.  But I was amazed to see
how far their OCR abilities have moved.  Best,
