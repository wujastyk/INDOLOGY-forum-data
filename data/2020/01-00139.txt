=?utf-8?Q?Re:_[INDOLOGY]_Vajras=C5=ABc=C4=AB?=
Dear all,
Just to comment quickly, though I haven?t studied the Vajras?c? in any depth, the same passage that Vincent highlighted, naming the Vedas, Grammarians, et al. is also the one that caught my attention, especially the mention of M?m??sikas. As far as I can tell, while the others do get mentioned in Chinese translations of Buddhist texts, the only text preserved in Chinese that mentions M?m??sikas is Xuanzang?s translation of Bh?viveka?s Praj??prad?pa, which mentions them twice in close proximity:
????????13?22 ????????????????????????[1]????????????????????????(CBETA, T30, no. 1566, p. 119, b15-17)
[1]???????
[1]???????
?Again there are the non-Buddhist (t?rthika) M?m?msikas who say: ?What is said by Buddhists In the twelve divisions of the their s?tras (canon), is that no person is omniscient, because they are conditioned (sa?sk?ra), just as is stated in treatises by the Vai?e?ikas, and so on.?
????????13?22 ??????????????????????(CBETA, T30, no. 1566, p. 119, c5-6)
?This like the non-Buddhist M?m?msikas who imagine that the Word of the Vedas is eternal.?
I have found no other mention of M?m??s? in any other Chinese sources (if anyone has information on discussions I might have missed, please let me know). Bh?viveka, of course, devoted an entire chapter in his Madhyamakah?daya to M?m??s?, but his description of their doctrines suggests they differed in several ways from the versions we are more familiar with post Pr?bh?kara and Kum?rila. It is the latter?s ?lokavarttika, of course, that made M?m??s? hard to ignore for subsequent Buddhists.
Harivarman?s Tattvasiddhi (translated by Kum?raj?va at the beginning of the 5th c) identifies (among others) Vai?e?ika, S??khya, Ny?ya, and Jains as p?rvapak?ins. More generally in Buddhist literature preserved in Chinese prior to the middle of the seventh century, the most commonly cited opponents are Vai?e?ika and S??khya. Ny?ya is mentioned infrequently, as are Jains.
As for the pram??a issue mentioned by Matthew, the Vajras?r? verse identifies what serve as authorities for non-Buddhists (the following verse turns to lineage):
ved?? pram??a? sm?taya? pram??a? dharm?rthayukta? vacana? pram??am |
yasya pram??a? na bhavetpram??a? kastasya kury?dvacana? pram??am || 2 ||
Which are more or less equivalent to ?ruti, sm?ti, and ?pti-pram??a, and analogous to ?scripture and reason? (?gama, yukti) that was the established criteria for validity for Buddhists, even into the pram??av?da era. And, as I wrote elsewhere:
"Prama?n?a-theory rst appears in the eleventh chapter of the first part (Su?tra-stha?na) of the CS [Caraka-sa?hit?]. Here the CS intriguingly proposes, along with the three prama?n?as one would expect (perception, inference, and authori- tative testimony), a fourth not found anywhere else: synthetic inductive reasoning (yukta-prama?n?a). Discussion of prama?n?a occurs in two other parts of the CS: part 3, Vima?na-stha?na, chap. 4 and chap. 8, but the unique yukta-prama?n?a is absent from those discussions, a sign of the strati ed nature of the text.?
So a yukta pram??a suggest to me a possibly early date for that category.
Has anyone considered whether it is possible that the verses may have been written by A?vagho?a or someone relatively early while the prose exposition may have been added by a later hand?
