[INDOLOGY] Help for identification of two Scripts
Dear list members,
Dear colleagues,
I hope this message finds you in good health. I am working on a Jewish manuscript, entirely in Hebrew script, which contains some notes at the end in Persian and these two ?Indian? scripts as well, with possible historical connection to Punjab. I hoped that someone here would be able to help me to identify the two scripts and eventually help me to read these two short notes.  
Thank you and best wishes from Berlin,
