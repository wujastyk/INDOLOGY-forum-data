Thank you, Gaia, for volume 2, which I previously could not find.

Volumes 1, 3 and 4 are available at archive.org <http://archive.org/> if you use the search term Josyer. You?ll find a scan of Volume 3 at: https://archive.org/details/sringaraprakasabhojavol3josyerg.r._20200304_40/page/n7/mode/2up <https://archive.org/details/sringaraprakasabhojavol3josyerg.r._20200304_40/page/n7/mode/2up>.

Best wishes,

Elliot
