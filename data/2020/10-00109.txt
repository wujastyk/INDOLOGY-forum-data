So, yes, this is Sinhala script, probably also Sinhala language. The Image was inverted; I had to download and flip it. Some letters are illegible, unfortunately. The last lines read something like:
(penultimate): ?gr?makotau viharati (*?) v?sayakara?aye
atikr?ntaloka*vo?(?)tugata a*np?*pa
Not normal Sinhala; quite Sanskrit (e.g. viharati)i, but some like v?sayakara?aye are clearly Sinhala.
Best,
Patrick

Dear Colleagues,
I transfer hereby a query from my colleague Catherine Borot Alcantara (cc-ed), who found a palm-leaf manuscript in the collections of the Mus?e Gu?don de Pouilly sur Loire.
It is beyond my field of expertise, but I trust that it is not for many among you.
My colleague is interested in any information about its script, language, date, content, etc.
Here are pictures:

The goal is to "valoriser" (as we say in French) this object.
Any information will be much appreciated and further collaboration on the description and "valorisation" of the manuscript is open.
Yours with very best wishes.
