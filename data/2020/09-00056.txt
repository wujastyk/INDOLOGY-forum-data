In this lecture at Harvard University in 2016, Prof. Nayanjot Lahiri seems to support Rajan?s dates.

Dear Herman,

 

Have you looked at the discussion of Tamil Brahmi inscriptions in K. Rajan?s ?Early Writing System: A Journey from Graffiti to Brahmi?, Pandya Nadu Centre for Historical Research, Madurai, 2015? See pp. 404-405. Table 8.2 on p. 407 has six pot sherds with Tamil Brahmi dated between 4th to 6th century BCE.

 

Rajan states on p. 400, ?The close observations of Dami?i (Tami?-Br?hm?) and Sri Lankan Br?hm? (Prakrit-Br?hm?) suggest they had close relations with each other in terms of paleography, probably due to geographical proximity, than the A?okan-Br?hm?.?

 

Regards,

Palaniappan

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Br?hm? in Sri Lanka

 

Dear List members,

 

In "Pasage to India? Anuradhapura and the Early Use of the Brahmi Script" (Cambridge Archaeological Journal 6/1 (1996), pp. 73-97) Coningham et al. conclude that the Br?hm? script was used on Sri Lanka by traders at least a century earlier than in "India" by A?oka. His dating of the inscribed pottery shreds in question is based on the radiocarbon method. In fact, a large part of the article is dedicated to a discussion of this method. What I would like to know is if there has been a reaction to Coningham's conclusions. Salomon (1998) does not discuss them and von Hin?ber (1990) and Falk (1993) could not.

 

With kind regards, Herman Tieken
