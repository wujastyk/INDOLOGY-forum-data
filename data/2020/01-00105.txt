[INDOLOGY] Siglinde Dietz article on Bower manuscript
Dear List members,
I'd be very grateful if anyone could provide me with a soft copy of the
following article. The book it's in appears to be hard to come by.
S. Dietz "The Meaning of k?tya-k?khorda-mantra-ve???a" in *Dharmad?ta.
M?langes offerts au V?n?rable Th?ch Huy?n-Vi*, edited by D. T. Dhammaratana
& B. P?s?dika, ?ditions You-Feng, 1997.
Many thanks in advance to anyone who can help!
Robert
