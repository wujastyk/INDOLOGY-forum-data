[INDOLOGY] The study of Sanskrit as the epitome of uselessness
?To study Sanskrit? (????? ????????) became a rather popular idiom (a kind of meme) in Russia in 2015, and it has been used since then?frequently?exactly as an epitome of a useless time-consuming and exhausting activity, which, in a long run,?may be?still more rewarding than engaging in Russian politics (especially as a member of the opposition). It was popularized by journalist Oleg Kashin, who has famously used this expression (the original wording was actually slightly different) in his debate with politician Alexey Navalny, who, in 2015, campaigned for opposition parties to participate at regional elections at any cost. See, for example, here or here. The original debate is here.
best,
Andrey
