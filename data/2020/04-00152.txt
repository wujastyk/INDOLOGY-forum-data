[INDOLOGY] Mayavada (was Lines to an Advaitin)
Of course, the references that Prof. Paturi gave to ?a?kar?c?rya's
etymological interpretations of the word m?y?, drawn from his father's
commentary on the *Vivekac???ma?i*, do not come from the *Vivekac???ma?i*.
They come from ?a?kar?c?rya's commentary on the *Bhagavadg?t?*, chapter 15,
verse 16, and from ?a?kar?c?rya's commentary on the *M????kyopani?ad* and
Gau?ap?da's *K?rik?*, chapter 3, verse 24. Both of these commentaries are
regarded by scholars such as Sengaku Mayeda as being by the same ?a?kar?c?rya
who is the author of the *Brahmas?trabh??ya*.
"The Authenticity of the Bhagavadg?t?bh??ya Ascribed to ?a?kara," *Wiener
Zeitschrift f?r die Kunde S?d- und Ostasiens*, vol. 9, 1965, pp. 155-197.
"On the Author of the M????kyopani?ad- and the Gau?ap?d?ya-bh??ya," *Adyar
