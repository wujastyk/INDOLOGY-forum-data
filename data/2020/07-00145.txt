Dear Madhav,
Rosen must have taken into account forms of medieval "living sanskrit"
noted by Vopadeva in his Kalpadruma.
Vopadeva lists, in stanza 265, *cur-ki steye*, with anubandha *ki*
indicating that it is among the roots that "belong to the *cur* class only
optionally":
Palsule, ed. of Kavikalpadruma of Vopadeva, Poona (sic) 1954, p. xxvii
(Vopadeva's anubandhas), and p. 43 for stanza 265: a commentary explains: *ki,
corayati corati*.
Palsule's Concordance published in 1955 in the Bulletin of the Deccan
College Research Institute lists *cur* on p. 46 as being accepted by all
grammarians exclusively as belonging to the Xth class, except Vopadeva who
accepts it in both the Ist and Xth class.
I did not check what your namesake Madhava has to say about *cur*.
But Melputtur Narayana Bhatta summarizes him in his brief comment on* cur*
(p. 619 of Guruvayur edition):
*cura steye / ak?ra uktyartha? / ??ica? ca? (AA 1.3.74) iti ta? cur?der
neti mata? m?dhavad??itam / tenobhayapaditvam eva / corayati,
corayate?rtham / *
*   ke cit sarvacur?d?n?m anitya?yantat?? jagu? /    ye??? vikalpacihna? (
? -citta? ?) sy?t te??m eveti m?dhava? //*
In addition, Narayana Bhatta gives* cura steye / corati* in his long
appendix to the Dhatupatha, under *drume?dhik? bhv?daya?*.
However, could one not have a perfect *cucora* even without accepting *cura
steye / corati*?
Best,
Jan
