[INDOLOGY] article by Karttunen
Dear list members,
Does anyone perhaps have a pdf of the following article by Karttunen:
Klaus Karttunen (ed.): History of Indological Studies Papers of the 12th World Sanskrit Conference held in Helsinki, Finland, 13 - 18, 2003; Motilal Banarasidass, Delhi, Vol. 11, 2, 2015, with a paper titled: How Sanskrit came to Sweden: The History of Swedish Indology until c. 1950. It should allegedly covers pages  79-110. But it seems nowhere to be found. Would anyone know which publication this is or where this paper was actually published?
Many thanks and warm regards
