In an astrological text tentatively dated to 13th-century Gujarat I came 
across this verse:
?ye sute bhuvi ?ubho hy adhik?rav?n sa
madhy?ni t?ni tu lagh?ny adhik?rah?na? |
dagdho ??ubhek?itayuto vidum?lag?m?
n?co dad?ti laghuvar?apade ca m?s?n ||10||
'[Placed] in the eleventh, fifth, or fourth house, benefic and 
possessing dignity, that [planet] gives its middling [years]; bereft of 
dignity, its lesser ones; combust, aspected by or joined to malefics, 
moving /vidum?la/, [or] fallen, months in the place of its lesser years.'
