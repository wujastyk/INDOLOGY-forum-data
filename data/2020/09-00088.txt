Dear Friends, I may be late to the party, but I just saw news of a supremely well-deserved honor and a welcome piece of good news in our kaliyuga=

Goldman have been awarded the AK Ramanujan book prize for their annotated translation of the V?lm?ki R?m?ya?a's final volume, Uttarak???a, the conclusion of their legendary and standard-setting R?m?ya?a translation project. Congratulations to the two of you!

It is creative apperception more than anything else that makes the individual feel that life is worth living. Contrasted with this is a relationship to external reality which is one of compliance, the world and its details being recognized but only as something to be fitted in with or demanding adaptation. Compliance carries with it a sense of futility for the individual and is associated with the idea that nothing matters and that life is not worth living. In a tantalizing way many individuals have experienced just enough creative living to recognize that for most of their time they are living uncreatively, as if caught up in the creativity of someone else, or of a machine.--Donald Winnicott, Playing and Reality
