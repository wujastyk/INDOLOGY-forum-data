 There is a similar well-known practice in the Tibetan tradition. I'll let our Tibetan experts elaborate.
There is also a well-known interaction going back centuries between Hindu yogis and Tibetan Buddhist yogis - they even revere some of the same adepts, especially in the Nath traditions. Among the actual yogic practitioners, the separation between Hinduism and Buddhism is not always so clear cut (the same is often true with Islamic fakirs and Sikhs as well).
So, I'd say, yes, there are similarities -- among the practitioners many would even go farther and say they are the same. I'm not aware of most of the scholarly literature on the subject. I'd be interested in what others might provide.
Best,
Dean

 Dear Friends,?
there is a particular breath work for cultivating endurance amongst the training manuals of Ninjas and proponents of the syncretic mountain asceticism, known as shugend?, which is called the?"mountaineer's breath" (??????,?tozan-ka no koky?). It has an interesting paradiddle-like ratio of inhalation/exhalation that supposedly can extend one's ability to stealthily?run across mountains at night, as long as the individual breathed in this complicated way while running... I've recently tried it...I guess, I need more practice.Some stories say that a high-level ninjutsu-sha could run up to 200kms in a day! These extend into the stories of the "marathon monks" that, as part of their spiritual duty would run a marathon, everyday for days on end. Life without Netflix is unbounded with potential, it seems.
Anyways, the rhythmic pattern for this breath, is:?
1 round =?1-inhalation, 2-exhalations, 1-inhalation, 1-exhalation, 2-inhalations, 1-exhalation
I'm wondering if this is similar to any ha?ha yogic pr???y?ma??
I'm not implying any causal link, necessarily. I leave that to others, who, in common parlance across various social media make consonant claims. Interestingly, a re-orientalized and imagined mythical Ninja culture is framed as being able to help reduce stress and tension, make people fitter, run for the train... and generally more able to endure more of life's problems, and, also have a transformative potential related to the twins of transglobal yoga's popularity: 1) accumulate power(s) and 2) achieve moral reformation.?
All the best,
