Dear Aleix,
I am not sure that this will be useful for you, but an e-text of the Tibetan is available here:

Is the Skt. readily available?

[INDOLOGY] Ca?gav?tti or Sambandhodde?a/Sambandhopade?a
Dear list,
I am looking for manuscripts of, and publications about, the Ca?gav?tti (or Sambandhodde?a or Sambandhopade?a), by Ca?gad?sa. I would be very grateful if any list member can help me to obtain scans. I am also interested in the Tibetan version of the text.
Many thanks and best wishes,
Aleix
