[INDOLOGY] Manusmriti ...
There is no statement of Manu that states all women are prostitutes. There are statements which emphasizes the need for women to be under male control/protection, the need to guard them from even the slightest attachment to sensual pleasure (sa?ga). See Manu 5.148ff, and 9.1ff.
