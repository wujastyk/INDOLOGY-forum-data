Dear colleagues,
I need to consult Gonda?s 1965 book Savayaj?as, of which I have only a partial photocopy.  Interlibrary loan is not doing hard copies during the lockdown, and purchasing a copy on-line has become prohibitively expensive (shipping cost alone from Europe is now over 30 euros).  Anyone have a scan?
Best,
Tim
