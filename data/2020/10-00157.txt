[INDOLOGY] Manusmriti ...
Dear List Members,
I need your help in understanding something from Manusmriti.
Is there any passage/rule in this text that states that ?all women are prostitutes?? Or anything close to such thought?
In Tamilnadu, there is a severe extremist movement wanting to burn Manusmriti. As the next election is approaching, the political scene is getting ugly as usual. One party?s propaganda includes that Manusmriti should be removed/burned down since it looks at women as prostitutes.
I was wondering if any of you would kindly check Manusmriti and let me know if he really declared that all women are prostitutes.
I would very much appreciate your help.
Thanks and regards,
V.S.Rajam
