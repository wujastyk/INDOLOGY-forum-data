   Dear all,

   With regard to Manu and "women being prostitutes," and with respect and
utter admiration for Prof. Olivelle, I would like to suggest that some
*?loka*s of the passages already mentioned suggest something beyond a
simple "need to guard [women] from even the slightest attachment to sensual
pleasure":





*nait? r?pa? par?k?ante n?s?? vayasi sa?sthiti?sur?pa? v? vir?pa? v? pum?n
ity eva bhu?jate pau??caly?c calacitt?c ca naisnehy?c ca svabh?vata?
rak?it? yatnato 'p?ha bhart??v et? vikurvate *

   In Prof. Olivelle's own translation ("they"=women, caps for emphasis mine
):

"They pay no attention to beauty, they pay no heed to age; whether he is
good looking or ugly, they make love to him with the single thought, "He's
a man!" Because of the lechery, fickleness of mind, and hard-heartedness
that are innate in them, EVEN WHEN THEY ARE CAREFULLY GUARDED IN THIS WORLD,
they become hostile towards their husband"

   I would remark here that although "lechery" is of course entirely
adequate, *pau??calya*>*pu??-cal?* is literally "one who runs after
men," idiomatically
and unequivocally a "prostitute," so perhaps something like "whorishness"
or "sl at ttiness" may convey more directly the flavour of the Sanskrit word.

   On a personal note, I feel the venerable Manu to be, without much
exegesis or word-bending, pretty antagonistic to a modern feminist agenda,
which I support.

   *namaskaromi*,

   Diego
