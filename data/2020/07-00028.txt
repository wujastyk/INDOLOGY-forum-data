Our foundation is *MLBD Research* *&* *Resource Foundation*
www.mlbdfoundation.org! Under the foundation we have done smaller # of
activities in the past, but we plan to undertake many other activities in
the future. Due to lockdown we are rather moving slow!



In addition, we have also created infrastructure *&* resource for our
*first* E-Journal, *MLBD Journal of Vedic Renaissance* you can view under
the foundation, but its progress has been rather slow! I would very much
like all scholars listed under your indology-owner at list.indology.info
mailer to benefit from this initiative by contributing their articles *&*
papers! I will greatly appreciate it if you could circulate this
information in this list. Looking forward to hearing from you.



Warmest Personal Regards
