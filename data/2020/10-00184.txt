[INDOLOGY] Manusmriti ... (Olivelle, J P)
Some list members may be interested in knowing the immediate political
context and raison d'?tre for the original query: the Bharatiya Janta Party
in Tamil Nadu is currently attempting to turn comments on the Manusmriti by
a Dalit activist into a wedge political issue
<https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/thirumavalavan-tamil-nadu-bjp-manusmriti-controversy-6907121/>
during
an election year. This has been well-documented in the press.
With all due respect, Professor Rajam, your query was made *explicitly *in
response to what you called "a severe extremist movement," i.e.
the Viduthaliai Chirsuthaigal Katchi, a Dalit political group. You also
quite clearly characterized such critiques of the Manusmriti as being by
"people who don?t know Sanskrit and who hate Hinduism, brahmins." Critiques
of the Manusmriti, especially by Dalits and feminists, do not constitute
anti-Hindu or anti-Brahmin sentiment, though they may indeed constitute
anti-Brahminical politics. If you have been misinformed in this regard, I
and others on the list will be happy to point you to the relevant sources.
I think you will find that those who want to symbolically burn the
Manusmriti do not want to end its study--quite the opposite--but rather
want something much more simple: to not be killed, raped, spat upon, or
discriminated against by upper castes.
But I suppose one has to believe that caste existed and exists in Tamil
Nadu before one can face the political consequences of it.
