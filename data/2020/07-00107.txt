[INDOLOGY] http://bombay.oriental.cam.ac.uk --> simcast
Dear All
An old message from John Smith sent to the Indology listserv and preserved
in the archive reads:
"The fonts are at http://bombay.oriental.cam.ac.uk: follow the "fonts"
link, then the "induni" link."
But when I enter the mentioned URL
http://bombay.oriental.cam.ac.uk
into my browser,
what opens is this page
https://simcast.com/?d=parrz.com&s=fallback
with a picture of Narendra Modi.
Do others get the same?
Yours Alex
