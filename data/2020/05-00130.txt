[INDOLOGY] Searching for a manuscript from Aufrecht's Florentine Sanskrit Manuscript Catalogue
All Sanskrit manuscripts described by Aufrecht are now kept at the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale di Firenze:
https://www.bncf.firenze.sbn.it/pagina.php?id=110
You have to contact them and ask about the current situation regarding digital orders.
Best wishes,

At one time, Pearson was a useful guide for this kind of question:
Pearson, J. D. Oriental Manuscripts in Europe and North America: A Survey. Zug: Inter Documentation, 1971. )Worldcat<http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/462814265>)
