Dear Madhav,
Nice anecdote about Pandit Jagannatha Upadhyaya giving a talk in Sanskrit
at the University of Michigan and you translating it for the audience. I
just found in his Academic Profile published in *?rama?a Vidy?: Studies in
Buddhism, Prof. Jagannath Upadhyaya Commemoration Volume* (1987), that the
title of this talk was: "Importance of Buddhism in Indological Studies." I
wonder if his talk and your translation of it was recorded. If so, I would
love to hear it.
He also gave a talk in Sanskrit at University of California, Berkeley.
Robert Goldman translated it for the audience. It was recorded and was (is
still?) available from the Language Lab there. He spoke slowly and clearly;
a joy to listen to for those (like me) who are not accustomed to spoken
Sanskrit.
I personally feel much admiration for him, and have much appreciation for
what he did. It was he who undertook and launched the project to publish
the great *Vimalaprabh?* commentary on the *K?lacakra-tantra*. The editor
of his commemoration volume, N. H. Samtani, called him the first Bauddha ?c?rya
of modern India ("In Memorium").
