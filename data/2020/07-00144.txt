[INDOLOGY] Texts on War Ethics?
Dear All,
Could you please suggest any Sanskrit texts that specifically deal with war
ethics? Apart from the Bhagavad Gita and the epics (the MBh, first of all),
there are some bits and pieces in the Artha??stra and Dharma??stras that I
know about.
Are there any "theoretical" works on war ethics? on laws of war and rules
for warriors?
All suggestions would be very welcome.
Best wishes,
Nataliya
