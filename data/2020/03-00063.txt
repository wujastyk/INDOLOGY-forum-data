[INDOLOGY] Beautiful writing style in Sanskrit among modern authors?
Dear all
I am searching for the different writing styles in Sanskrit where we can
express our thoughts in the style of contemporary.
 For example, T Ganapati Shastri. Counter example Jaggu Vakalbhushana.
Please name some great authors, even written thing may be preface, letter,
commentary will be useful.
Thanks.
