Subject: [INDOLOGY] Beautiful writing style in Sanskrit among modern authors?
Message-ID: <CAODNnZjw71Ec6cCm4a+31pPTw2dE3YAMmoUDZ-w5pTNJigGsMw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all
I am searching for the different writing styles in Sanskrit where we can
express our thoughts in the style of contemporary.

 For example, T Ganapati Shastri. Counter example Jaggu Vakalbhushana.
Please name some great authors, even written thing may be preface, letter,
commentary will be useful.

Thanks.
