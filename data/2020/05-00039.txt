[INDOLOGY] Techniques of Blinding
If my memory does not fail me, Goldstein?s History of Modern Tibet  
contains a firsthand account of a high-ranking government official  
being blinded as a punishment. The technique applied first was to put  
pressure on the temples till the eyes would pop out. When this failed,  
his eyes were cut out with knives.
Best wishes, E.F.
