[INDOLOGY] Anniversary of INDOLOGY
Dear colleagues, 
Thirty years ago today I launched the INDOLOGY list:
Today, we have over 800 members and the forum is - I think - flourishing.&nbsp; INDOLOGY has found an enduring place in our indological lives.&nbsp; 
On a personal note, I wish to express my thanks to the members of the INDOLOGY management committee, whose role in maintaining this forum has been equal to and often  more important than mine.&nbsp; Thank you, Adheesh, Philipp, Stefan and Wendy.&nbsp; And thanks also to past members Audrey, Gary, John, Harunaga, Madhav, Christian, Birgit and Jan.&nbsp; Without all your guidance and daily work, INDOLOGY wouldn't be what it is today.
I will be raising a glass of champagne later today to toast you all and the INDOLOGY forum.&nbsp; Here's to another thirty years.
Best,Dominik
