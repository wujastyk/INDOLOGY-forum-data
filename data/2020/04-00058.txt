Look at the first Matrix movie,? says producer Peter Rader. ?It?s a yogic
movie.
It says that this world is an illusion. It?s about *maya* ? that if we can
cut through

things.
Neo achieves the abilities of the advanced yogis [Paramahansa] Yogananda
described,
who can defy the laws of normal reality.?

How movies embraced Hinduism (without you even noticing)
