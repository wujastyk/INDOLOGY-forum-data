Thanks for the interesting references expanding on the notion of
an *?k??ag?min* in immediate textual association with the early A?vagho?a,
and likewise to Dan for reminding me/us of YS 3.42.
Of course, the spiritual metaphors of moving in(to)/within space and doing
so 'auf dem Pfade des Windes' are both ancient and belong together; we just
have to recall the frequently studied Vedic hymn ?V 10.136.
Thus, considered decontextualized, *Vajras?c?* 12 has little force with
respect
to revealing much about its historical authorship.
Yet, when stumbling over this verse, its authorship had already been
disconnected from A?vagho?a, the 1st?2nd century CE author, with the
weight of his erudition by Vincent, saying ?we might perhaps agree that
the *Vajras?c?* is unlikely to have been composed before the 3rd-4th
century CE.
I am inclined to believe that it is even younger.? Placing the *terminus
post quem*
into the 3rd-4th century does likewise entail that ?the word of caution
about
chronology with respect to Manu? as shortly elaborated by Johannes
Bronkhorst,
however pertinent for the cases adduced, has rather lost its relevance for
the *Vajras?c?*. And having not yet met with the notion of an *?k??ag?min*
in the various Buddhist philosophical contexts elaborating their notions of
*m?rga* in the centuries pointed out as the temporal frame for
preliminarily
(at the present stage of our knowledge) locating a *terminus post quem*, the
question of *siddh?c?rya* as a marker that distinguishes the *Vajras?c?*?s
author
A?vagho?a from A?vagho?a, the 1st?2nd century CE author, did assume
suggestive significance. That is, despite the often questionable reliability
of colophons.
Yet, once we hypothetically admit the significance of such a marker to
socially and historically contextualize a *siddh?c?rya *A?vagho?a, it is
possible
to look at the assertion of *Vajras?c?* 12 and try to understand it in the
broader
context of how the Buddhists historically have dealt with the ethical
problem
of killing animals/sentient beings and enjoying them as food for human
beings
(ritually embedded or not). Doing so one may arrive at reasonable results,
which nevertheless remain hypothetical ones, unless additionally backed up.
All the best, Hartmut
