[INDOLOGY] sanskrit and computers?
I?d rather approach the problem/task at hand from a different perspective ? that is ? what computer language is suitable for describing/analyzing a human language. I have had exposure to human languages and computer languages, so I say this with confidence.  
Thanks and regards,
