Dominik,

 

Thank you. I have registered as you suggested.

 

I would prefer the conference to be virtual. Apart from the uncertainties associated with vaccine development for Covid-19, a virtual conference will make it accessible to a lot more people, if sufficient bandwidth is available.

 

Regards,

Palaniappan

I planned a conference for last month on this very issue, and Tim was one of the invited speakers.  See 

https://www.eventleaf.com/greatermagadha
But it had to be cancelled, back in March, due to the obvious.  

 

We are currently in active discussion about whether to hold it as a physical conference next April, or maybe June, or whether to go virtual.  We're all getting much more used to virtual than formerly: it's getting normalized.  And there are advantages but also you lose a lot by not having folks in the same room.

 

I have made a new website,

https://www.eventleaf.com/GreaterMagadha2021
where you can register as an "attendee" if you want to receive future information about this meeting.

 

Best,

Dominik

Dear Indologists,

I just read the review essay, ?Greater Magadha and the New Brahmanism: Recent Publications by Johannes Bronkhorst? by Tim Lubin published in 2015. Now that we are in 2020, have there been any updates to scholarly opinions or consensus regarding Bronkhorst?s conclusions, especially the ones considered controversial? 

Thanks

Regards,

Palaniappan
