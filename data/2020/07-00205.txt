Respected Scholars,I came across the following chronological depiction of the Upanishads , while going through an article by Dr.Deviprasad Chattopadhay(published 2010/2012):-AiteriyaVrihadAranyakaChandogyaTaiteriyaKausitaki.
A feature of the above 5 earliest Upanishads, were that they were all written in Prose form.According to the same chronological hierarchy, Isa comes much later, and is composed in rhythms.

Re: [INDOLOGY] Thieme on ??opani?ad
  Dear Madhav,
I seem to recall that Patrick Olivelle discusses the relative chronology of the principal Upani?ads in the introduction to his translation of them, published by Oxford University Press.
All the best,Jeff

Dear Colleagues,
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I have been rereading Professor Paul Thieme's article on the ??opani?ad published in the JAOS.&nbsp; In one of his discussions, he seems to claim that the Ch?ndogya-Upani?ad is older than the ??a.&nbsp; Here is that passage:
What is a good modern discussion about the relative chronology of the "older" Upani?ads?&nbsp; Has anyone discussed Thieme's views?&nbsp; With best regards,
