Dear all,
?
does anyone know where I could find a copy of this document, online or in a library?
?
Selected Papers, Punjab Police Department, No. XVIII, 1869.

These papers are mentioned in Rose?s and Ibbetson?s works on Tribes and Castes of the Punjab and contain a description of the Rawals, a group of Muslim yogis.

Best wishes,
