Dear Michael,

     This book is now included among the 100 books that the University of
Michigan Press is now planning to put on Open Access using the Open Book
Initiative of the NEH.  Will let you all know when this actually goes
online.  In the meantime, I will send the pdf for this article to your
personal email.  Best,

Madhav
