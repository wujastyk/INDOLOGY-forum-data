[INDOLOGY] Scan Tent, portable gadget for scanning manuscripts
I recently discovered Scan Tent (seems to be a cousin of the Transkribus
project):

At face value this looks promising for anyone travelling around and needing
a convenient, high-quality solution for scanning manuscripts.
If you have tried Scan Tent on Indian manuscripts, please post your
experience here in INDOLOGY.
