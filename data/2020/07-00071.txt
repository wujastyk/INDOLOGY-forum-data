Subject: [INDOLOGY] Scan Tent, portable gadget for scanning manuscripts
Message-ID: <CAKdt-Cfv0ik4bko=pZgvWsohUmjUjzY01SHoUQJpbQd=jms_rQ@mail.gmail.com>

I recently discovered Scan Tent (seems to be a cousin of the Transkribus
project):

   - https://readcoop.eu/scantent/

At face value this looks promising for anyone travelling around and needing
a convenient, high-quality solution for scanning manuscripts.

If you have tried Scan Tent on Indian manuscripts, please post your
experience here in INDOLOGY.

Best,
Dominik
