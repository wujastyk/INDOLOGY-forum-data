[INDOLOGY] k?tti
Dear friends,
The Vivekavil?sa (8.275) mentions k?tti as one of the characteristics of Buddhist monks:
k?tti? kama??alur mau??ya? c?ra? p?rv?h?abhojanam/
sa?gho rakt?mbaratva? ca ?i?riye bauddhabhik?ubhi?//
k?tti means "skin, hide" and other such things. Does this make sense in connection with a Buddhist monk? Any help or explanation will be appreciated.
