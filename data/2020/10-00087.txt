Can emendations like ku??, k?rt(t)ir, kr?t?, or a compound k?tti-kama??alur 'skin-gourd' be excluded?

Subject: [INDOLOGY] k?tti


Dear friends,



The Vivekavil?sa (8.275) mentions k?tti as one of the characteristics of Buddhist monks:

k?tti? kama??alur mau??ya? c?ra? p?rv?h?abhojanam/

sa?gho rakt?mbaratva? ca ?i?riye bauddhabhik?ubhi?//

k?tti means "skin, hide" and other such things. Does this make sense in connection with a Buddhist monk? Any help or explanation will be appreciated.


Johannes Bronkhorst
