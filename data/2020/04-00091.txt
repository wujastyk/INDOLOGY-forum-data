[INDOLOGY] A distraction from the Coronavirus
Please accept this metrically more sound version of my last verse:
????????????????????????? ? ?????????? ?

I am indepted to Dr. Roland Steiner for reminding me of Pi?gala's rule 
na pratham?t snau according to which two light syllables are not allowed 
after the very first one in a p?da.
