Subject: [INDOLOGY] Scholarship on the practice of self-starvation in Buddhism
Message-ID: <633C09FA-AE20-4126-B166-2E81F0EE8A22@me.com>

Dear List Members,

I have a student doing research for an essay on the practice of self-starvation in Buddhism, specifically the Shingon concept of self-starvation and mummification called sokushin j?butsu in Japanese.

It is not my area of expertise and would be very grateful for any recommendations of scholarship on this topic to pass on to the student.

Many thanks,

Chris Gibbons
UQ, Brisbane, Australia.
