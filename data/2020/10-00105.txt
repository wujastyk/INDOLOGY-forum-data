[INDOLOGY] Mosquitoes
Dear colleagues,
I?ve been asked whether I know of any studies of mosquitoes or other disease-carrying insects in Indian literature. I don?t, and a search of the indology archive reveals nothing either. I would be very grateful for any suggestions.
Yours, with best wishes,
Jim
