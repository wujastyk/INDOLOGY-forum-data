=?utf-8?Q?[INDOLOGY]_g=C4=81yatr=C4=AB_meter?=
Dear list members,
Both these hymns have g?yatr? chanda? in the preamble where it lists ??i?,
devat?,chandas. But the metre of both these hymns is 4 feet of 8 syllables
each, and  Apte`s dictionary lists  g?yatr? metre as 4 feet of 6 syllables
each.  Can someone explain this.
