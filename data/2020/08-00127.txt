[INDOLOGY] Altar of Fire / goats
This issue is discussed in a rather heated exchange:
Schechner, Richard. 1986. ?Wrestling Against Time: The Performance Aspects
of Agni.? *The Journal of Asian Studies* 45 (2): 359?63.
Staal, Frits. 1987. ?Professor Schechner?s Passion for Goats.? *The Journal
of Asian Studies* 46 (1): 105?8.
All the best,
Eric
