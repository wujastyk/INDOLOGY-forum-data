[INDOLOGY] C.W. (Sandy) Huntington
Thanks, Bradley, for posting this sad news.  Sandy Huntington was not just
my student, but he was among my very first students when I joined the
University of Michigan in 1972.  After studying with me at the university
for a year, Sandy ran out of money and could not register for classes.  I
told him that if he wanted, he could come to my home a few days every week,
and I taught him at my home for a whole year.  He had no car in those days
and he used to walk to my home in the midst of Ann Arbor's snowy winters.
Then he went to Banaras for a year and two and was studying with Pandit
Upadhyaya.  During his stay in Banaras, he wrote me a few letters in
Sanskrit.  He invited our family to his apartment for X-mas party, and he
remembers that our daughters, probably aged three or four, opened every
cabinet in his house to look for what they could find.  They were very fond
of him. At some point, I wrote to him asking for his address.  He wrote
back saying "you should put my name in your Will to inherit all your
Sanskrit books."  I would have been very happy to do that, but now it is
too late. The last time I saw Sandy was in April 2017 at the function
organized by my department to celebrate the occasion of my retirement.  He
shared his memories of his student days at Michigan.  I have a video of
that occasion and so Sandy's last visit to Ann Arbor remains alive in my
mind.  I am very sad to lose him.  This reminds me of a saying placed in
the mouth of Upagupta in the A?ok?vad?na: ??????? ??? ???????????????????.
