He also published two significant monographs, Pa?li Literature (1983) and A Philological Approach to Buddhism (1997; 2nd edition 2006), and leaves behind eight volumes of his Collected Papers (1990?2007). From 1981 to 1990 he was editor of A Critical Pa?li Dictionary, overseeing the publication of seven fascicles (11?17) of vol. II.

As well as being a Fellow of the British Academy and a Foreign Member of the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters, he was the longest serving member of the Council of the Pali Text Society (1959?2010) and also served as its President (1981?1994)

It is safe to say that all those who work on ancient texts in middle Indian languages will remain deeply indebted to his work for a long time to come.

With best wishes,
