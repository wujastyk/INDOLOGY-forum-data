[INDOLOGY] Grammar question
Thank you to Johannes Bronkhurst, Brendon Gillon, Roland Steiner,
Christophe Vielle, Phillip Mass, Adriano Aprigliano who all gave
essentially the same answer.
The "accusative with the infinitive" (Latin: Accusativus cum
infinitivo = ACI) is a special syntactical construction found in
various forms in languages like Latin, Greek and also English. The ACI
forms a subordinate clause to certain verbs. The accusative which is
governed by the main verb ("want" in the example below) is the
"subject" of this subordinate clause with an infinitive as its
predicate. Example in English:
"I want you to do this."
"you" = accusative, "to do" = infinitive.
In German, we have to use another construction:
"Ich m?chte, dass Sie das tun." (literally: "I want that you do this.")
