[INDOLOGY] Question
Thanks, Mrinal, for this clarification.  This question came up because we
have recently joined a Marathi discussion group, where we are reading the
?????????, a philosophical work of ??????????, and the person who is
leading the discussion is mixing up the ???kara Advaita with Kashmiri
?aivism.  However, it seems to me that J??ne?vara's own work, along with
his more well known commentary on the Bhagavadg?t?, the J??ne?var? alias
Bh?v?rthad?pik?, are syncretic works. J??ne?vara's guru is his own elder
brother Nivr?ttin?tha belonging to the N?tha tradition.  So it appears that
a brand of Kashmir ?aivism percolated into Maharashtra through the N?tha
tradition and it got syncretized with ???kara Advaita and Bhakti
traditions.  I am myself just at the beginning stages of sorting all this
out, and I would appreciate any suggestions.  With best wishes,
