[INDOLOGY] Interdining_19th century - 1930s
Dear colleagues,
I would be very thankful for references to works about BRAHMANS'
activities/initiatives in North India and, particularly, Maharashtra,  
breaking the
caste rules of segregation of untouchables. The time period in question
is the end of the 19th century - 1930s.
Although the subject doesn't exactly fit in the major research interests
of the list members, the hope is strong for receiving a response.
Best regards,
Tatiana
