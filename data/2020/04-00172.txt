[INDOLOGY] CORRECTION: Help needed translating tantric verse
Thank you to those who replied off-list.  I've received two very different
views of the meaning of
 j?grat-k?rma-sam?rit? in the verse which I've summarized below.
VIEW 1
     The Bhagavadg?t? uses the example of K?rma for a state of the complete
withdrawal of the senses:
*yad? sa?harate c?ya? k?rmo' ?g?n?va sarva?a? /*
*indriy???ndriy?rthebhyas tasya praj?? prati??hit? // 2.58//*
     Such a state would contrast with the state referred to by the word
*j?grat*.  Thus, it seems refer to the state of focusing inward.  I am not
quite sure if you would call it sleep, or more likely a conscious
concentration that directs awareness inwards.
Perhaps it means "she who abides in both the waking state and the state of
complete withdrawal of senses."

I think that k?rma here refers to the microcosmic equivalent of the
tortoise that supports the world. I don?t know of any clear references to
this idea in texts, but one often sees Ku??alin? supported by a tortoise in
?cakra scrolls? from the 17th century onwards. See the attached image for
an example.
That still leaves j?grat, which seems odd here. One would want it to
contrast with nidrit?, i.e. to make a distinction between Ku??alin? when
asleep and awake, but that would require j?grat?. So I think one has to
understand the compound as meaning ?situated on a waking
Thanks,
