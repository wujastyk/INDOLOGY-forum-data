[INDOLOGY] Metrical inconsistencies and tradition
Yes, this would be exactly what I meant. In addition to having 8 
syllables per /p?da/, G?yatr?s are generally (but not always) iambic. 
But I can't really see that there's anything wrong with the metre of 
this Ga?e?a-G?yatr? (maybe it's called /nic?d/ because the original 
G?yatr? verse ended up with 7 syllables in the first /p?da/, and the 
author thought this was standard?).
Mieko Kajihara's very detailed paper is excellent and I can only 
recommend it! You can also expect more information about the mantra and 
especially its defication in my dissertation. It's still 
work-in-progress, but you can find drafts, presentations and papers on 
https://univie.academia.edu/DominikHaas. The project plan is also 
archived here, if you dislike academia.edu (which I perfectly 
understand, considering the amount of trash emails they now send on a 
daily basis): https://doi.org/10.25365/phaidra.103. Sorry for the 
self-promotion!
Best,
Dominik
