Dear List members,
In "Pasage to India? Anuradhapura and the Early Use of the Brahmi Script" (Cambridge Archaeological Journal 6/1 (1996), pp. 73-97) Coningham et al. conclude that the Br?hm? script was used on Sri Lanka by traders at least a century earlier than in "India" by A?oka. His dating of the inscribed pottery shreds in question is based on the radiocarbon method. In fact, a large part of the article is dedicated to a discussion of this method. What I would like to know is if there has been a reaction to Coningham's conclusions. Salomon (1998) does not discuss them and von Hin?ber (1990) and Falk (1993) could not.
With kind regards, Herman Tieken
