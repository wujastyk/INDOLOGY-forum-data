Dear colleagues and friends,

Further to the sad news of the sudden passing, due to cardiac arrest, of
our esteemed colleague and dear friend Stefano Zacchetti, this is to let
you know that a small funerary service will take place on Tuesday May 19,
2pm, in Oxford.

Due to the current policies in response to the Covid-19 pandemic,
participation will be restricted. Those of you who wish to send a message
or a donation to the family may contact the address
zacchettisfamily at gmail.com for contact details.

Some obituaries and remembrances have appeared in the past weeks. A few
have been gathered here:

In great sadness,


Jonathan Silk
