?The theory of universals that was developed and upheld by Buddhist
philosophers in premodern India since the sixth century CE is famous for
its central claim that any judgment of a similarity between things is
due not to anything substantially real that the things share, but to
their difference from other things (/any?poha/).  This book investigates
the theory as it is presented in the /Apohasiddhi/, a work written by
the Buddhist monk and teacher Ratnak?rti in the eleventh century, during
the last flowering of philosophical activity in Indian Buddhism.?
