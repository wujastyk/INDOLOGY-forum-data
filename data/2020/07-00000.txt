Dear colleagues,

I am pleased to give you an update on the Initiative for Fair Open 
Access Publishing in South Asian Studies <https://foasas.org/>. As 
announced we have compiled *a list of FOASAS publishers, journals and 
book series*. It is now online:

We would like to thank all colleagues who have contributed to this list! 
We'll do our best to keep it up-to-date, so if you have any suggestions 
please don't hesitate to write to contact at foasas.org

Best regards,

Dominik A. Haas
