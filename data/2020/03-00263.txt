[INDOLOGY] Metrical inconsistencies and tradition
Dear Harry,
thanks a lot for the reference, didn't know this one! Even the wrong 
accent is noted there already.
Well yes, mantras like these were called G?yatr?s. The matter is a bit 
complicated though. As far as I have come to understand it, they were 
called thus because they imitate the famous G?yatr? verse (?gveda III 
62.10) or are modified versions of it. But this verse acquired the name 
?G?yatr?? rather late (considering its own age), for the first time 
perhaps in the Taittir?ya-?ra?yaka and then also in later additions the 
Dharmas?tras (in the Mah?bharata, too, the verse is called G?yatr? 
several times, especially in the later strata).
So the point is that the modified G?yatr?s were perhaps never actually 
thought to be in the /g?yatr?/ metre (not even by its creators, whenever 
they lived), but were only called G?yatr? because they resemble the 
verse. I normally use /g?yatr? /for the metre and G?yatr? for the verse 
(I did not do so in my previous email though). So the modified G?yatr?s 
are probably not examples for metrical license, i.e., they are not 
/g?yatr?/ verses, even though they are called G?yatr?s.
But it could very well be that some commentator explained them to be in 
the /g?yatr?/ metre, but a /g?yatr?/ metre with extra syllables etc.
Best regards,
Dominik
