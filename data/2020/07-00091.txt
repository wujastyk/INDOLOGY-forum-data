[INDOLOGY] Buddha's visit to Lanka
Yes, the matter of Mahinda's mission to Sri Lanka is a separate one, to at
least some extent, from the  "coming of the Buddha" to the island of Sri
Lanka as described in the Dipavamsa.
I suppose some of Alakendu's (if I may) questions could begin to be
answered by consulting the text of the Dipavamsa itself, which is available
here (in Pali and Hermann Oldenberg's English translation):
https://www.ancient-buddhist-texts.net/Texts-and-Translations/Dipavamsa/index.htm
It describes the Buddha making several visits to (Sri) Lanka, by means of
the supernormal powers he has attained through meditation. The primary
reason is said to be destruction of various demonic forces there, so that
the doctrine and path may be established there. The Buddha also predicts
the eventual arrival of Mahinda's mission, so this is where that event ties
in.
As I understood your initial question, Alakendu (again, if I may), you were
asking if there is any "proof" of these visits besides this textual
account. I think it is safe to say that the scholarly consensus is "no".
However, I suppose there are scholars--and here we get into interesting and
important (at least to me!) issues of etic versus emic perspectives and
modern scholarship's attitudes towards the "miraculous"--for whom the
textual accounts and phenomenon like the supposed "footprint" on Sri
Pada/Adam's Peak would constitute some kind of valid evidence.
