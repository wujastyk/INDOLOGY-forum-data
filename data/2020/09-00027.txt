Hello Sundari,

     I see these quotations from various texts embedded in the commentary
Tattvabodhin? on Bha??oji's Siddh?nta-Kaumud?, on rule 3168 of SK [p. 531,
edition of SK with Tattvabodhin?, edited by Wasudev Laxman Shastri
Panshikar, 7th edition, Nirnaya Sagara press, Mumbai, 1933]:  These are
comments on the word *gaur?:*

"???? ???????????:?????????????????:" ... ??? ?????? ?..."????????? ?? ??
????? ???????????????? ? ?? ???? ??????? ????? ? ???: ??????????: ??" ???
?????????????? ????????????? ????????????????? ? ???? "???: ?????????:"
??????? ?????? ??????????? ?

   The end of the above passage uses the quote fromthe Brahm???a-Pur??a to
argue that the word *gaura? *used by Pata?jali in defining a Br?hma?a does
not refer to the skin color, but it has a Dharma??stric significance as
"the son of a woman who was given at her age of eight to a learned and
righteous Brahmin."  The same quote is used by the great N?ge?abha??a in
one of his commentaries. I have cited that in one of my publications, and I
have to hunt down that reference.  But it is exactly the same argument.
   On a personal level, the history of my own family shows the gradual
change from that old standard for the age of marriage.  My grandmother was
married when she was 9.  My two paternal aunts were married at the age of
14 or 15, and since that was considered rather too late, they were married
to widowers.  My own mother was married at her age of 16.  This is an
interesting trajectory of history within a single family.
    With best wishes,
