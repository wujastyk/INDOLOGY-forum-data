[INDOLOGY] List of texts published in the journal The Pandit
Dear List Members,
I thank Ashok Aklujkar for having kindly provided me with a scan of his
1966 article on The Pandit.
The article is written in Sanskrit and was published in the
Pune-based Sanskrit journal ??rad?.
I will try to attach it: it is not a very heavy file but perhaps it will
not come through...
In any case, I note the following:
sa?sk?ta-patrak?rit?-?at?bd?-vi?e?alekha? ?pa??ita?-patra-paricaya?
??rad? 1888-1966, pp. 7-13 (22 May 1966)
by Ashok Aklujkar
containing an
Index of The Pandit under the following headings :
prathit?? k?taya?
s?m?nyata? aprathit?? k?taya?
??gly? an?dit?? prathit?? k?taya?
??gly? an?dit?? s?m?nyata? aprathit?? k?taya?
sa?sk?tena an?dit?? k?taya?
pa??it??ke?u mudrit?? mahattvap?r??? nibandh??
With best regards,
