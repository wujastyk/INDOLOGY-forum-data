While not directly concerned with this j?taka, you might find this essay by An?layo informative, esp. fn. 4.

The trend seems to be, according to those sources, a domestication of Sakka from the fearsome Indra, slayer of the dragon V?tra in the ?g Veda, to a docile devotee of the Buddha. However, Buddhaghosa identified Sakka with Vajrap??i, the fearsome protector of the Dharma, who pummels those who threaten or bad-mouth the Dharma. So apparently even as late as Buddhaghosa?s day (ca. 5th c CE), the ?terrible? form of Indra was still resonant with how Buddhists viewed Sakka/?akra.

A demon falls in love and tries to catch her but ?akra rescues her.  The corresponding mural depicts ?akra as a terrible being holding a club in his hands. The Pali J?taka provides no description of a disguised ?akra but in the Sinhalese Sambul?-J?taka we can read, that ?akra saves Sambul? in the disguise of a terrible being (...Sakdevraja bhay?naka v??ayak ge?a ...). I suppose this is recorded in a source of the M?lasarv?stiv?da-Vinaya tradition, written in Sanskrit or Tibetan.
