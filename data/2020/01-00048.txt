The reference 10.28 matches with the Ma?dhyandina recension - cf. Weber's ed. with the commentary of Mah?dhara, and other subsequent eds like the following one from Nirnaya Sargar Press Bombay:
https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.56847/page/n187
The commentary of S?ya?a at the same is to be found in the edition of the Ka??va recension at 11.38
see here, p. 20 of the second fasc./part (which starts after the p. 148 of the first part):

https://dli.sanskritdictionary.com/bookpage.php?Id=0B7JhzNLs-FQEQjJBSFNwZ0ttNXc
(it should be on Archiv too, but I was able to find it only on the "Sanskrit Dictionary" DLI mirror)

Dear friends,
I am searching for S?ya?a's commentary to V?jasaney? Sa?hit? 10.28, and since I am travelling at the moment and do not have access to a library, I will try my luck here instead. I have the following translation from Panduranga Bhatta's "Dice-Play in Sanskrit Literature" (Delhi, 1985), but I need to check it against the original Sanskrit:
"The game is played with five dice, four of which are called k?ta, whilst the fifth is called kali. If all the dice fall uniformly (ekar?pa), i.e. with the marked sides either upwards or downwards then the player wins, and in that case kali is said to overrule the other dice." (p. 80)
Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Best regards,
Jacob
