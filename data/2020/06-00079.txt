Thank you Aleksandar.  I've also been informed offlist that this meter  but
with the names  R?jaha?s? and Vibh??a?? is in the  three volume 1959
edition published in Pune by Prasad Prakashan, with editors P. K. Gode and
C. G. Karve. . I was looking in Apte's 1890 edition where it didn't
appear.  Apparently the modern editors expanded  the metrical section.

Harry Spier
