>  *m?y?v?da* indeed does not to belong to the many *v?da*s alluded to by
?a?kara himself, and especially
 to those by which he refers to his own teaching (*veda-*, *ved?nta-*,
*brahma-*, *?tma-v?da*). As pointed out by Paul Hacker,
?a?kara has no specific theory of *m?y?* (at least in the
*Brahmas?trabh??ya*), but mostly uses the term in similes (much like the
Buddhists).

--- Not to contradict the view " ?a?kara has no specific theory of *m?y?" ,
*but just to remember occasions where he gives meaning of the word,
resorting to his favourite etymological approach, picking up from my father
(Sitaramanjaneyulu Paturi)'s notes to his Telugu commentary on Viveka
Chudamani,

?????? - ??????????????? - ??????????? ( ???????? ) ???????? ?????????????
- ??????????????????????????????????????? ( ????????? -15 ??????? )

??????? - ????????????????? - ?????????????? ( ????? ????????????  -
???????????? ?????? 2)

He seems to have taken ???? - ???? as the dhaatu for ???? . In words such
as ??????? it has meanings related to  ????????????? ,  ??????? . as in
????????? above.

In words such as ??????, it has meanings related to  ??????? ,  ??????  as
in ????????????????? above.

Writing in English deprives my lines of the majesty of Sanskrit. However what English lacks in the melody and rhythms of Sanskrit it will hopefully make up in its rasa.Wait O! Advaitin, before I accept your mayavadaLet me tarry a bit and enjoy the lotus face of Krishna.Kind regards,HarshaProf. Harsha V. Dehejia
