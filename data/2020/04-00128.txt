m?y?v?da indeed does not to belong to the many v?das alluded to by ?a?kara himself, and especially to those by which he refers to his own teaching (veda-, ved?nta-, brahma-, ?tma-v?da). As pointed out by Paul Hacker, ?a?kara has no specific theory of m?y? (at least in the Brahmas?trabh??ya), but mostly uses the term in similes (much like the Buddhists).
See Hacker?s short but illuminating remarks in his groundbreaking ?Eigent?mlichkeiten der Lehre und Terminologie ?a?karas: Avidy?, N?mar?pa, M?y?, ??vara? (Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenl?ndischen Gesellschaft 100, 1950, 246-286), pp. 268 ff.
With kind regards,
Vincent

Dear Dean,

The term was used first, for all we know, by Bhaskara, in a pejorative sense. Hajime Nakamura?s first volume of his History of Early Vedanta Philosophy is a good source on this.

Best wishes,
Aleksandar

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Mayavada (was Lines to an Advaitin)

I notice that this post uses the term 'mayavada' in referring to Advaitins. This is appropriate in this context I suppose because it is offering an alternative perspective to Advaita.

But some of the Advaitins I have spoken to say that that is a term coined by their opponents and that it is inaccurate, even if it has been adopted by some ill-informed Advaitins to refer to themselves and become part of the popular speech. These Advaitins say that the emphasis should be on 'avidya' or 'mithya' rather than 'maya'.

I wonder if anyone has any comments about this or could point me to some publications that discuss it.

Note: I am interested in the scholarly discussion of these terms and the associated concepts, not in a discussion about which is the supreme realization. :-)

Best,

Dean

Friends:Inspired by Madhav Deshpande and with a long history of my polite confrontations with Advaitins I propose to write 100 lines.I am a staunch Krishna rasika. Writing in English deprives my lines of the majesty of Sanskrit. However what English lacks in the melody and rhythms of Sanskrit it will hopefully make up in its rasa.Wait O! Advaitin, before I accept your mayavadaLet me tarry a bit and enjoy the lotus face of Krishna.Kind regards,HarshaProf. Harsha V. Dehejia
