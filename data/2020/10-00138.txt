[INDOLOGY] Article by Witzel
Dear all (an intentional email to Indology for once),
Does anyone happen to have a pdf of:
Witzel, M. (1987), 'On the Origin of the Literary Device of the "Frame
Story" in Old Indian Literature', in Hinduismus und Buddhismus:
Festschrift Ulrich Schneider (Freiburg: Hedwig Falk), 380-414.
Would be much appreciated!
All the Best,
Victor
