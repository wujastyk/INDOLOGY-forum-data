[INDOLOGY] paleographic question
Dear friends,
When and where does one first see the development of the ornamental script known in Nepal as Ra?jana (Tib. Lantsha)? I'm assuming Pala-period Bihar/Bengal, but would be pleased to be corrected about this or to receive greater specification.
thanks in advance,
Matthew
