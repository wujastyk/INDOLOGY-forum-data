[INDOLOGY] Indian jewellery
Dear Alessandro,
years ago, answering to a question concerning anklets, a member of this group recommended this volume: Tewari, S.P., N?pura. The anklet in Indian literature and art. With a
foreword by C. Sivaramamurti. Delhi: Agam Kala Prakashan, 1982.
I?ve never had the book in my hands, but its title strongly suggests that it focuses on anklets only? Unfortunately, no Italian library has it.
Best,
Marco
