Such articles make me very sad.

Evidently none of the four authors, nor any editor before the article 
was published, noticed that seven vibhaktis are mentioned (section V) -- 
and then comes a list of eight. This is only one of many problems I have 
with this article. (Another one is ?chez le garcon- in the boy?, another 
is ?a phrase in English language "I like apple" can suggest a brand of 
Computer or a kind of fruit apple? (no!), another one is the total 
irrelevance of section IX, especially as soon as we are dealing with 
non-Indo-European languages.)

Nothing really good comes from such publications.
