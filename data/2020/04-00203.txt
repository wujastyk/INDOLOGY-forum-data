=?utf-8?Q?Re:_[INDOLOGY]_Source_of_the_post-position_=E0=A4=A8=E0=A5=87_in_Hindi?=
Thomas Oberlies, /A Historical Grammar of Hindi/ (2005:29), wisely 
refrains from giving an etymological explanation for the Hindi 
postposition ??. In note 8 he refers to L.A. Schwarzschild, Collected 
Articles (1991:93), who "surmises that the Prakrit/Apabhramsha 
postposition ???-? is continued by Hindi and Gujarati ?? and Marathi ???/???."
S.H. Kellogg, /A Grammar of the Hindi language/, repr. 1965, p. 131-2, 
shows with a number of arguments - the main of which is the fact that 
"/ne/ cannot be traced back further than two or three hunderd years" - 
that this postposition cannot be related to the Sanskrit instrumental 
-/ena. /His conclusion: "... we are thus at once led to connect it, like 
the /nai, nai_n/, and /n?/, which in some Western Hindi dialects are 
substitued for /ko/, - through the Naipali /le/, with the root 
/lag/;//the order of the derivation being as follows: Sk. past. 
part.act. /lagya/, Pr. /laggio/, H. /lagi, lai, le , ne/."
It seems that the final word on the origin of /ne/ has not yet been spoken.
