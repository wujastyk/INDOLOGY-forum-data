=?utf-8?Q?Re:_[INDOLOGY]_sa=E1=B9=81kita?=
Dear Harry,
To my knowledge, only three of five planned volumes have been  
published so far. The third volume comprises the words beginning with  
the letters /?-ph/.
You can use the NWS ("Nachtragsw?rterbuch des Sanskrit"; a cumulative  
supplemental dictionary of Sanskrit) to find out whether a particular  
term is listed in TAK I-III.
Example:

Best wishes,
