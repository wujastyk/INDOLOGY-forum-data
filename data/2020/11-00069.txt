[INDOLOGY] sources for the idea that reincarnation is a semi-random process?
Getting back to Dean's original question on whether rebirth is
karma-deterministic or not:
In cognitive neuroscience prediction, randomness, probability, are all
major research topics -- there are many aspects of the data we can study
about the mind and brain that involve these ideas, including ranging from
something sometimes called 'ballistic' in the sense of basically automatic
and highly predictable, to other functionality that appears nearly random,
freedom of choice, etc. There's a lot of mathematical modeling involved
(aka computational neuroscience).
If we take the idea of reincarnation seriously, i.e., not just as a
cultural artefact, but something that might be 'real' in the western
scientifically-oriented sense (i.e, just as 'real' as the Indo-Tibetan
traditions consider it), then all sorts of interesting research questions
come up, and Dean's original question would be central to these.  A couple
of such questions might be: a) Could an incarnating person be somehow
capable of choosing parents/family specifically, or would there inevitably
be a certain degree of randomness or unpredictability involved, perhaps
mathematically akin to modeling and predicting the weather?  b) What might
be the criteria for an incarnator to be capable of choice, or, rather be
deterministically/ballistically driven by prior karma?
