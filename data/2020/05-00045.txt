Dear Dr. Koch,
In the Avad?na?ataka (I. 9, Dh?p?vad?na) is mentioned a contest between a
Buddhist and a religious opponent, taking place through a "declaration of
truth" (satyavacanam) - a similar term for satyakriy?. Before making his
declaration, the Buddhist is described as throwing back his cloth on his
shoulder and putting his right knee to the ground. This is also an
interesting echo of the idea of the bh?mispar?a-mudr?.
With best wishes,
H?l?ne de Brux
