[INDOLOGY] poison
Dear Jonathan,
Book 14, Chapter 1 of the Artha??stra provides recipes for poisons for killing enemies. One example: powder made from the speckled frog, Kau??inyaka-insect  .... all this mixed with the sap of the Bhall??aka-tree ... causes instant death. The smoke of these products has the same effect. But where will you colleague find a speckled frog?
Best, Herman
