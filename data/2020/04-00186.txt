[INDOLOGY] sanskrit and computers?
Dear Patrick,
This is something I have been engaging with on and off, partly to see
whether one can actually do anything with the idea, but mostly to use it as
a hook with which to get people to think about their conceptions of what
language is and what it can be used for.
I am not aware of anything cogent by any stretch of the imagination, but
I've attached an article about Sanskrit use for NLP that I've sometimes
seen referred to as 'proof' that this is a respectable/serious subject for
academic study. (It is IEEE, but from the proceedings of a conference
rather than one of their own (prestigious) publications.)
You already mention Briggs' article; I am curious to hear what else people
may be able to contribute. This is mentioned so often that there *have* to
be some efforts to make more of the idea.
All the very best,
     Antonia
