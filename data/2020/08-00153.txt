Thank you to everyone who sent me editions of the Chanda?s?tra with
Y?davaprak??a's commentary!

I now have three versions in addition to the one on archive.org:

Edited by ?r?dharav?si??ha, N?ga Pabli?ars, 2004
Edited by Haridas Sinharay, The Asiatic Society, 1977
Edited by Vijayap?la, ?rmat? S?vitr?dev? B?ga?iy? ?ras?, 1988.

I would be happy to share any of them. I'm not sure what the policy is
about giving links publicly to material still under copyright...

All the Best,
Victor
