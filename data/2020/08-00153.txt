=?utf-8?Q?Re:_[INDOLOGY]_Pi=E1=B9=85gala?=
Thank you to everyone who sent me editions of the Chanda?s?tra with
Y?davaprak??a's commentary!
I now have three versions in addition to the one on archive.org:
Edited by ?r?dharav?si??ha, N?ga Pabli?ars, 2004
Edited by Haridas Sinharay, The Asiatic Society, 1977
Edited by Vijayap?la, ?rmat? S?vitr?dev? B?ga?iy? ?ras?, 1988.
I would be happy to share any of them. I'm not sure what the policy is
about giving links publicly to material still under copyright...
All the Best,
Victor
