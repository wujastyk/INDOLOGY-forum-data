[INDOLOGY] An article by Kamil Zvelebil
Dear Scholars,
There has been much interest expressed in this article on- and off-list. I am sorry there was a typo in the subject line as pointed out by Edeltraud Harzer. On the off chance, somebody with access to the article might have been misled by the erroneous name in the subject line, I am reposting the request.
I would appreciate very much if anyone could share a pdf of the following article by Kamil Zvelebil.
?The Descent of the Dravidians.? International Journal of Dravidian Linguistics, 1: 57-63.
Thank you.
Regards,
Palaniappan
