[INDOLOGY] [RISA-L LIST] sources on markers of girls' transition to adulthood
An arithmetical correction to note for the translation of Manu 9.94c:
4) Manusm?ti
tri??advar?o vahet kany?? h?dy?? dv?da?av?r?ik?m |
trya??avar?o '??avar??? v? dharme s?dati satvara? || MDh? 9.94 ||
?A 30-year-old man should marry a charming girl of 12 years, or an 24-year-old, a girl of 8 years -- sooner, if his fulfilling the Law would suffer.?
The groom is thus prescribed to be 2.5 to 3 times the age of the bride.

Re: [RISA-L LIST] [INDOLOGY] sources on markers of girls' transition to adulthood
Below are some additional indications that could be followed up in the course of your research.
Kind regards,
WS
1) See Richard Schmidt (Beitr?ge zur indischen Erotik. 3. Aufl. Berlin 1922: 645?649) with source quotes on marriage age and also marks of pubescence).
2) See moreover Ram Gopal, India of Vedic Kalpas?tras. Delhi 21983: 212 with relevant quotes (p. 220, n. 59) also on the important term nagnik? (?naked?) in the context of the ideal marriage age:
nagnik?m [=] apr?ptastr?bh?v?m ayauvanaras?m upayaccheta (?let him approach a nagnik? girl for intercourse in whom the sexual characteristics of a woman are not yet developed and in whom the menstrual fluid (yauvanarasa) has not yet emerged.?).
nagnik?, defined as the ?best? (?re??h?) in the above passage of M?navag?hyas?tra as cited by Gopal, seems actually to refer to the absence of pubic hair (aj?talomn?) as also discussed, e.g., by Bha??an?r?ya?a on Gobhilag?hyas?tra 2.5.7. According to the latter?s testimony there were ?c?ryas who stipulated intercourse with prepubescent married girls lacking pubic hair, if these girls themselves desired so:
yady aj?talomny ev?t?va puru??bhog?rthin? sy?t, tath? sati, [?] maithuna? kartavyam ity eke ?c?ry? manyante.
3) The Kashmirian K??hakag?hyas?tra determines the age of marriage of girls at 10, at the very latest at 12 years (da?av?r?ika? brahmacarya? kum?r???? dv?da?av?r?ika? v? KGS 19.2), on which Devap?la comments: var?ada?ak?d ?rdhva? brahmacarye kum?r? na sth?payitavy? pitr? ? agaty? v? dv?da?a var???i n?tikrama??y?ni ? (Devap?labh??ya ad 19.2. ||
4) Manusm?ti
tri??advar?o vahet kany?? h?dy?? dv?da?av?r?ik?m |
trya??avar?o '??avar??? v? dharme s?dati satvara? || MDh? 9.94 ||
?A 30-year-old man should marry a charming girl of 12 years, or an 18-year-old, a girl of 8 years - sooner, if his fulfilling the Law would suffer.? (Olivelle 2005, p. 194).
There is a wider range of evidence for an ideal marriage age for girls aged 8 (a??avar??): To start with P?rvat?, ?iva?s wife, it is said that she was married at the age of eight (8), i.e. before puberty, the technical term for which is gaur? (significantly also used as an epithet for her):
5) Jayadratha?s Haracaritacint?ma?i
dev? himavata? putr? k?l? n?lotpalacchavi? |
a??avar?? tapoyukt? bhart?ra? pr?pa dh?rja?im || Hc 22.3 ||
s? kr??ant? pit?gehe ?ambhun? saha p?rvat? |
d???v? d???v? vapu? ?y?ma? n?ha? gaur?ty alajjata || Hc 22.4 ||
6) gaur? = a??avar?? = prepubescent:
Brhadyamasmrti (= Par??arasm?ti 7.4):
a??avar?? bhaved gaur? navavar?? ca rohi?? |
da?avar?? bhavet kany?  ata ?rdhva? rajasval? || YS 182v 3.21 ||
7) A??avar?? marriage in the Rev?kha??a of the V?yupur??a:
pu?y?ham adya sa?j?tam aha? tvaddar?anotsuka? |
kany? mad?y? r?jendra hy a??avar?? vyaj?yata || RKV 142.18 ||
[?]
caturbhujo mama sutas tri?u loke?u vi?ruta? |
tasyeya? d?yat?? kany? ?i?up?lasya bh??maka || RKV 142.20 ||
8) R?m?ya?a
S?t?, too, was married before the age of puberty as a ?kaum?r??:
svaya? tu bh?ry?? kaum?r?? ciram adhyu?it?? sat?m |
?ail??a iva m?? r?ma parebhyo d?tum icchasi || R?m 2.27.8 (CE)||
The G?t? Press translates from an emic insight point of view: ?who was married to you before puberty?.
The commentaries R?m?ya?a?iroma?i und Bh??a?a on this passage (R?m 2.30,8) confirm kaum?r? as ?kum?r?vasth?y?? eva viv?hit?? (?married already in the period of life of a ten to twelve years old maiden?).
kum?r? = 1. ?A young girl, one from 10 to 12 years old? (Apte)
9) A significant term for a a sexually mature, fully developed girl is prau?h? (cp., eg., Bh?gavatapur??a 4.25.21 (a-prau?h? ? ?not yet fully developed?), or ??h? (cp. nava-??h? ? ?having just attained puberty?, as in Brahmavaivartap., ch. 112).

Hello Sundari,
     I see these quotations from various texts embedded in the commentary Tattvabodhin? on Bha??oji's Siddh?nta-Kaumud?, on rule 3168 of SK [p. 531, edition of SK with Tattvabodhin?, edited by Wasudev Laxman Shastri Panshikar, 7th edition, Nirnaya Sagara press, Mumbai, 1933]:  These are comments on the word gaur?:
"???? ???????????:?????????????????:" ... ??? ?????? ?..."????????? ?? ?? ????? ???????????????? ? ?? ???? ??????? ????? ? ???: ??????????: ??" ??? ?????????????? ????????????? ????????????????? ? ???? "???: ?????????:" ??????? ?????? ??????????? ?
   The end of the above passage uses the quote fromthe Brahm???a-Pur??a to argue that the word gaura? used by Pata?jali in defining a Br?hma?a does not refer to the skin color, but it has a Dharma??stric significance as "the son of a woman who was given at her age of eight to a learned and righteous Brahmin."  The same quote is used by the great N?ge?abha??a in one of his commentaries. I have cited that in one of my publications, and I have to hunt down that reference.  But it is exactly the same argument.
   On a personal level, the history of my own family shows the gradual change from that old standard for the age of marriage.  My grandmother was married when she was 9.  My two paternal aunts were married at the age of 14 or 15, and since that was considered rather too late, they were married to widowers.  My own mother was married at her age of 16.  This is an interesting trajectory of history within a single family.

Hi all,
I am looking for sources that explore the age at which a girl traditionally becomes an adult woman (meaning, she transitions into defacto adulthood by the standards of the time) in Hindu culture, prior to the 19th century. I'm already aware of the Indian Penal Code setting the age of consent for marriage for girls at 10 years old in 1860, and the history following that.
In particular I'm looking for primary and/or secondary literature that mention bodily processes, rites of passage, age, or other markers of that transition to adulthood.
Many thanks!
