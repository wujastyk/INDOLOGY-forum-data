[INDOLOGY] Help with publication
Dear Tim,
Many thanks! I guess this is a lesson for me that if I'm looking for a electronic version of a book, I should either try googling it or look directly on archive.org, since duckduckgoing (apparently not a word yet) did not hold any results.
Best wishes,
Camillo
