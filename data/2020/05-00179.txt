Dear Tim,

Many thanks! I guess this is a lesson for me that if I'm looking for a electronic version of a book, I should either try googling it or look directly on archive.org, since duckduckgoing (apparently not a word yet) did not hold any results.

Best wishes,

Camillo

Dear colleagues,



I was wondering if any of you could help me by providing an electronic version of the following publication:



H. Sakya and T. R. Vaidya, Medieval Nepal (colophons and inscriptions), Kathmandu 1970



Best wishes,



Camillo
