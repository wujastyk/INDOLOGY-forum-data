[INDOLOGY] Orientation of text in sanskrit printed book
Dear Harry,
This format was fairly common in the nineteenth century, especially after
the introduction of lithography made it possible to recreate the 'look' of
a manuscript page. Ulrike Stark has written a bit on this (see *Empire of
Books*) as has Graham Shaw ("The Introduction of Lithography and its Impact
on Book Design in India"). Shaw characterizes lithography as making
possible the "mass production" of manuscripts. I think there are some other
things to be said about that but certainly some communities did see
lithography as a way to mass produce copies of sectarian works in the form
with which they were familiar.
All best,
Tyler
