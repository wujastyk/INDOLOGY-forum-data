Hi Matthew,
   The ?Favorites? tab in keyboard preferences still exists, but it is not displayed until you add characters to it.
   In the ?Show Character Viewer? option under the keyboard menu (now called ?Show Emoji & Symbols?), select a character.  In the right side details window you will see a button ?Add to Favorites.?  When you click this, it will add the character to your favorites list and the tab selection will reappear.
Best,
Paul

Dear friends,
I recently bought a new MacBook Pro with the OS Catalina.
My old MacBook had an earlier OS, in which it was quite easy to locate characters with diacritical marks not among the standard Mac accents, which would then be stored in a tab called 'favorites' with keyboard preferences.
In Catalina, that is gone, and I do not see any easy way to locate and insert the diacritical marks. I would be grateful for some pointers.
with thanks in advance,
Matthew
