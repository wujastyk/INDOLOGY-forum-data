[INDOLOGY] Outage for some websites
Outage notice:
The website
   - http://catalogues.indology.info
is hosted on a system in the UK that is down for maintenance.  We're being
told it will be 6-7 hours before it's back, starting at 23:00 hrs UTC.  By
my reckoning that is about an hour and a half from now, so the outage may
have started a little early.
Other INDOLOGY-related websites are not affected, nor is the discussion
list.
I apologize for any inconvenience.
Best,
Dominik Wujastyk
INDOLOGY committee member.
