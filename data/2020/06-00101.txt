Dear Harry,
     I have a pdf of the Mand?ramarandacamp? in the K?vyam?l? series, and
of the three volume edition of Apte's dictionary edited by P. K. Gode and
C. G. Karve.  "The Cologne Digital Sanskrit Dictionaries website gives a
publication date of 1957" because the three volumes were published in the
three successive years 1957, 1958 and 1959.  If you need these pdfs, I can
send them to you via WeTransfer.  Let me know.  Best,
Madhav M. Deshpande
