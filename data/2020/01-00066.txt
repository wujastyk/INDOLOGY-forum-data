[INDOLOGY] help with inscription
Dear Matthew,
It seems that the first syllable with a ligature is -lki; the part after
"vijaya" is probably "sa" (but "su" would make more sense ? hard to see
though).
The whole thing looks like: nama? kalki-vijaya-suk?rtaye ("sa" and "ta" are
written almost like in Bengali, as well as "e" in "ye").
Is it possible in this case?
Just my two cents, I hope a specialist in paleography will do better.
Best wishes,
Nataliya
