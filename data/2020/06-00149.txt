Dear Nataliya and Michael,

some time ago I also was in search of a proper S?a?rada? font and
decided to render one myself, should there be enough time, based on the
mss. I am working with. If you should discover a proper design in the
meantime, I would be very glad about any notice.

Aside its questionable style, the Noto Sans font only contains the most
basic ligatures rendered rather inaccurately, beside e.g. a superlinear
Jihva?mu?li?ya rendition I?ve never seen anywhere.

Best,


Raik Strunz

Dear Michael,Many thanks for your detailed answer! I know about Google
NOTO ? it is unusable indeed. 
I will look into the Newari fonts you recommend, although they are
probably no good for Bhujimol.
Thanks again!
Nataliya

           Dear Nataliya,
     I have searched extensively in the past few years for Sharada and  
    Newari fonts (preferring unicode) for use as illustrations of      
original texts in my forthcoming edited anthology, *A Garland of      
Forgotten Goddesses* (UC Press).  
     
     For Sharada, the only option I was able to find is Google's Noto   
     Sans Sharada, which is so ugly as to be unusable.  
     
     For Newari fonts, there are some decent ones for modern forms of   
   the script, such as described at the bottom of this page       (with
links to the fonts).  I am not aware of any fonts for the       older
"Bhujimol" form of the script.  There is also a       Devanagari-encoded
"unicode" font for the Ranjana script you might       be interested in,
described         here.  These Devanagari-encoded Newar fonts work well,
      despite using the Devanagari unicode character map.  See here and
here for       full-page samples.
     
     All the best,
