[INDOLOGY] Etymology of Skt. nilaya
As for Sanskrit *nilaya*, we not only have the noun *nilaya*, but the verb
*ni+l?yate*, which is productively used in Sanskrit, along with words like
*nil?na,* a participle. The verb *l?yate *can occur by itself, with
derivatives like *laya* and *l?na*, and also with other preverbs, e.g.
*pra-l?yate*, with derivatives like *pralaya *and *pral?na*. Given this
state of Sanskrit usage, how would one deal with the suggested Dravidian
etymology?
