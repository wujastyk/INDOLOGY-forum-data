I am very touched by Nick's passing. I spent numerous lunches and dinners
talking with him over matters of interest to both of us at Wolfson College.
I remember him especially for his great curiosity (and humility): despite
his advanced age, he was attending nearly every conference on nearly every
subject in Oxford. His grand-son was attending the same school as my son,
and we often saw Nick coming to pick him up - he loved his family tenderly.
