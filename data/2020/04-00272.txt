I have transcribed in searchable format Vi?var?pa?s commentary B?lakr??? (9th century) on the Y?j?avalkya Sm?ti. It is available to view here as a Google document, under Sanskrit:

https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/southasia/language-program/languages.php

As I mentioned earlier, the commentary on Y?j?avalkya by Vij??ne?vara called Mit?k?ar? (12th century) is also available at the same site.

If you find any typos or errors, please do let us know and we will correct the files.

With thanks and best wishes,

Patrick
