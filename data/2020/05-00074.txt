I always thought the first, with ?, was correct, and the second was just an
orthographic error.  Then I saw "-ko?a" on the title page of Ingalls's
*Subh??itaratnako?a*

He must have thought about this.
So which is "right" and why?
Best,

PS I haven't even done elementary due diligence on this question, beyond MW.
