[INDOLOGY] A distraction from the Coronavirus
Dear Mr Steiner
I am glad to read your examples.But in ancient epics such as the Ramayana
and Mahabharata,etc some uses of padma are found in masculine .But in
post-paninian poetry these usages are not available.Hence in the works of
Poetics as the Kavyaprakasa it has been considered a
dosa( blemish) to use a word in unpopular
gender.There is cited an example,bhaati padmah sarovare.Hence Post-paninian
poets don't use it in Masculine.
Thank you very much to give us an opportunity to exercise our mind.
Kindest regards
Girish K.Jha
