Dear colleagues,
Another example of possible irony towards Brahmins in Buddhist  
narrative literature may be found in the following pair of verses from  
?rya??ra's J?takam?l? (?JM):
hata? ca yaj?e tridiva? yadi vrajen
nanu vrajeyu? pa?ut?? svaya? dvij??
yatas tu n?ya? vidhir ?k?yate kva cid
vacas tad e??? ka iva grah??yati (?JM 10.13)
atulyagandharddhirasaujasa? ?ubh??
sudh?? kilots?jya var?psarodh?t?m
muda? pray?syanti vap?dik?ra??d
vadhena ?ocyasya pa?or divaukasa? (?JM 10.13)
"If one goes to heaven by being killed in sacrifice,
surely brahmins themselves would become sacrificial animals.
But since one never sees this practiced,
who would accept the words of such men?
Would the gods reject their pure nectar, served by fine nymphs,
incomparable in scent, richness, flavor, and potency,
and take joy in the slaughter of a pitiful animal
to feed off its intestines and other parts?" (transl. Justin Meiland)
(?rya??ra must have lived by the beginning of the 5th century CE at  
the latest, but possibly earlier.)
With best regards,
