[INDOLOGY] Bharatiya Itihasa Samshodhak Mandal, Pune
Is anyone in Pune and likely to visit the BISM any time?  Or do you have
contact details for the BISM?  I am interested in a manuscript that may be
there, but I don't know whom to write to or how to request a copy or
photograph.
The details of the MS are given at PanditProject

Many thanks,
