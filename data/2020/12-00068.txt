Dear All,
Thanks to this list being a real kaly??akalpataru, I have received links to
N?ge?a's Uddyota and am deeply thankful for them. Ramanujacharya's article
about adverbs (Ramanujacharya N.S. 1966 "Kriya?-vis?es?an?a?na?m?
karmatvam" SVUOJ 9, Sanskrit section,: 9-14) seems more difficult to come
by, but I am not losing hope that this wish, too, may be granted.
Gratefully,
Radhika
