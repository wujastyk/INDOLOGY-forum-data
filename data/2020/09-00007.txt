[INDOLOGY] Question
Dear Prof Deshpande,
This is a problematic question. ?a?kara is completely unknown to the
authors of non-dual ?aivism or even the dual ?iddh?nta ?aivism. In fact
Utpala and Abhinava are using the 'advaita' of Bhart?hari to encounter the
'advaita' of Vij??nav?da Buddhists to establish their own 'advaita' point.
So Ved?nta at large and particularly ?a?kara is nowhere in the picture.
There is a very nice preface written by Prof Ambikadatta Sharma to the book
of Prof Navjivan Rastogi titled 'Abhinavagupta k? tantr?gam?ya
dharma-dar?ana' (2013) where he philosophically engages with this question
mentioning why historically speaking ?a?kara does not become important in
the case of ?aiva schools of Kashmir, both dual or non-dual.
Having said that, there certainly are references here and there to
*??ntabrahmav?din*s, but mostly they are passing references. Ved?ntins have
never been important for ?aivas. However, I do think there should be a
study that clearly reflects upon the two non-dual positions. I am saying
this because I have myself seen in my own teaching practice that how easy
is it to slip into the shoe of ?a?kar's advaita when one is teaching
Abhinava, for instance. I am trying to work on something. Let us see if I
can finish it sooner than later.
Best wishes.
