Dear Colleagues,
Just wanted to share that I was able to locate the reference with the help
of Mr Shankara from BVP Forum. Thanks to him. Just in case someone is
interested:
https://openlibrary.org/books/OL161872M/Meghad?tam
https://www.worldcat.org/title/meghadutam-dvadasabhasa-padyanuvada-vibhusitam/oclc/313620508
However, I do not think I will be able to have access to a PDF of this book
sooner. Thanks to all of help.
