[INDOLOGY] two guides published by the DHARMA project
Dear friends,
Arlo's post leads me to ask: has no one prepared a good, clear guide to using Indic languages in TeX?
best regards,

[INDOLOGY] two guides published by the DHARMA project
Dear colleagues,
Allow me to draw the attention of those among you interested in the use of TEI and in issues of romanization to the following two publications of the DHARMA project:
DHARMA Encoding Guide for Diplomatic Editions
https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/DHARMA/halshs-02888186
DHARMA Transliteration Guide
https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/DHARMA/halshs-02272407
A companion Encoding Guide for Critical Editions is currently being drafted.
Best wishes,
Arlo Griffiths
