[INDOLOGY] A piece of insolence
Dear list,
in reading the auto-biography of the Kerala social reformer V.T. Bhattathiripad (1896-1982) born in a Nambudiri brahmin family (My Tears, my Dreams - Kanneerum Kinaavum, New Delhi: Oxford UP, 2013, translated from the Malayalam), sprinkled with Sanskrit verses (from the author's memory) in approximative transliteration (unfortunately I have not yet the original, with correct Sanskrit, version), I come across the following ?loka (p. 27, corrected):
daiv?dh?na? jagat sarva?  mantr?dh?na? tu daivatam |
tan mantra? br?hma??dh?na?  br?hma?o mama daivatam ||
with the author's comment "I don't know which idiot made up this verse in Sanskrit".
