=?utf-8?Q?[INDOLOGY]_jayant=C4=AB?=
Dear list members is jayant? in its meaning as birthday (i.e.
k???a-jayant?, gane?a-jayant? etc.) sanskrit?  I had always assumed that to
be the case but a sanskritist told me that jayant? as birthday was marathi
and not sanskrit .  I did not see an entry for  jayant? in Apte's
dictionary or in Boehtlink-Roth but Monier-Williams had a
hanumaj?jayant? f. the
day of full moon of the month Caitra (being the supposed birthday of
Hanumat)
Thanks,
Harry Spier
