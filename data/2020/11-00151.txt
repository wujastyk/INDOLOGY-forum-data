Turner's article is mainly about the type of compound seen in a?va-tara, and, among other forms, mentions vy?ghra-tara, which ended up in Kipling's Jungle Book as Bagheera. As to a?vatara, Turner writes that it is of pre-Indo-Aryan origin. It would be supported directly by Persian astra and indirectly by Khotanese kha?ara "mule", from hypothetical khara-tara (with reference to H.W. Bailey, BSOA 10, 590).
