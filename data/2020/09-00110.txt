Dear Colleagues,
We note with great sadness the passing of our friend and colleague Dr. Kapila Vatsyayan with whom nay of us have worked over the years. She was a mainstay in the cultural, artistic, literary world of traditional Indian Studies and a great institution builder through her  longstanding association with the IIC and her service as the founder of the IGNCA. She will be sorely missed.
