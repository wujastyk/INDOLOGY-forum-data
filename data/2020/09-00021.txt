Thank you, Prof. Slaje,
for bringing this very deserving publication to our attention. However, 
not the complete Sanskrit text of B??a?s K?dambar? is covered by this 
index, which lists lemma only up to Parab's edition (Bombay 1948) p. 
237, i.e., only a part of the p?rvabh?ga. This is mentioned in the 
preface, but no hint of it is given in the title of the book or by the 
Series number.
Are there plans to publish an index of the remaining parts?
