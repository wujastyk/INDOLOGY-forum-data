Dear Matthew,

This is an intriguing reference. It is certainly a good example of similar animals being used in similes to distinguish different ideas on liberation. The role of each animal in the comparison is very clear, whereas this is not so much the case in the Yogab?ja, as far as I can see.  

Thank you for sending it and I also enjoyed reading the rest of your article. 

Yours, with best wishes,

Jason

The monkey achieves liberation by practising yoga for a long time in one life. The crow achieves liberation very quickly in one lifetime after practising yoga over the course of many past lives. The author mentions that this has been taught in another work (anyagrantha).
