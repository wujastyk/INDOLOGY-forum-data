[INDOLOGY] Crow and Monkey
Dear Matthew,
This is an intriguing reference. It is certainly a good example of similar animals being used in similes to distinguish different ideas on liberation. The role of each animal in the comparison is very clear, whereas this is not so much the case in the Yogab?ja, as far as I can see.  
Thank you for sending it and I also enjoyed reading the rest of your article. 
Yours, with best wishes,
Jason
