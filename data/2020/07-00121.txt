Subject: [INDOLOGY] Scan tent
Message-ID: <CAGbyd22w64=83Hk35c5GRQGqCusv0R7RD7iXmX7OoiEjj6LVRw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Dominik
I was truly excited by your note on the Transksribus not so much by the
project itself but by the scan tent that they are using. As you may know I
have been both an art historian and  photographer of fine arts, of
primarily Buddhist art, for five decades and the scan tent they are using
with its internal lighting and ease of object manipulation seems ideal for
some of our work. To that end I have tried to find one in the photographic
equipment market. No luck. Do you have any idea where such a tool might be
available?

Sorry to bother you with this but there are a couple of thousand flat
images to prepare for the Archive, it will be a great service to me if you
know.

Thank you

John Huntington
