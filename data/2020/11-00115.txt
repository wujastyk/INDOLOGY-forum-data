Dear Professor Lusthaus,
from Bh?skaraka??ha?s commentary we can only learn in what way he took
a?vatar? (f.) to mean in the given context.
In the given context, he equals a?vatar? (f.) with a va?av? (f.).
Therefore: va?av? (f.) stands for a?vatar?. a?vatar? = va?av? is what he
means to say. He uses va?av?, as a va?ava has a somewhat ambiguous nature:
?a male horse resembling a mare [...]? (MW).
However, he specifies what he actually means, because va?ava used by itself
is not sufficiently precise (in the given context):
kharastriy?m a?v?j j?t? = ?born from a female donkey and (male) horse?, in
your own words.
?So that is an attempt to treat a?vatar? as a hinny?. Right. This is
exactly what I was getting at and what Roland Steiner's translation says.
Additional information can be extracted from Bh?skaraka??ha. If a female
hinny (a?vatar?) gets pregnant, he adds, foaling is not possible without
opening the abdomen (tasy? garbha? kuk?ip??ana? vin? na niry?ti).
I cannot find any translation or interpretation errors here.
Of course, everyone is free to question and to criticise premodern Indian
authors for their observations of nature. However, we should never forget
that in the present case we see the unspectacular depiction of an everyday
reality, and that the authors were able to observe their environment more
closely than we can today. If, what Bh?skaraka??ha had had to say about
female hinnies, had been made up, his explanation of the d????nta would
have come to nothing. He would have simply made a fool of himself among his
contemporaries. Maybe he did, maybe he did not. I for one believe he did
not.
Kind regards,
WS
