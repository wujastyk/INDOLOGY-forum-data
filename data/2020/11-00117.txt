As an addendum to the question whether Bh?skaraka??ha would have made a
fool of himself or not by his claim, let me draw your attention to
?nandabodhendrasarasvat??s commentary  *V?si??hamah?r?m?ya?at?tparyaprak??a*
(AD 1710 [Karl-Heinz Golzio IIJ 47 (2004): 301ff]) on the *Yogav?si??ha*,
where the passage occurs in identical wording (= *Yogav?si??ha* I.14.8).
His explanation matches the one given by Bh?skaraka??ha (AD 1725-1775
[Stanislav
Jager, Bh?skaraka??has *Citt?nubodha??stra*. Marburg 2018: 15]):
*a?v?d gardabhy?m utpann? a?vatar?* | *tasy? udaravid?ra?enaiva
garbhanirgamana? **prasiddham* (VTP on YV I.14.8)
?An *a?vatar?* is born from a female donkey (*gardabh?*) and a male horse (
*a?va*). It is well known that the foal can only come out [of the mother]
by opening her belly.?
See also *Sa?ghabhedavastu* (ed. Gnoli, p. 72, ll. 20f):
*vadh?ya a?vatar? garbha? g?h??ti; par?bhav?ya a?vatar? garbha? g?h??ti *
The *Mah?bh?rata* has a cognate passage:
*sa m?tyum upag?hy?ste garbham a?vatar? yath?* || MBh 12.138.30cd ||
?The (king who does not restrain the enemy whom he has bent down with the
rod of force) sits holding death to his bosom, like a mule with a foal in
her belly.? (Fitzgerald, p. 531).
The idea that a female hinny would not survive the birth of her foal was
obviously widespread and ?nandabodhendra explicitly states this as a
well-known fact (*prasiddha*).
At least that much can be said that Bh?skaraka??ha?s explanation would
certainly have been accepted as plausible by his contemporaries.
For this reason, I would not put too much trust in the dictionary entries,
as their authors, who apparently were not always sufficiently versed in
natural history, could not tell the difference between mule and hinny. To
them, any crossbreed between a donkey and a horse equalled a ?mule?. This
is probably the reason why the (English) dictionaries show no entries of
the term ?hinny? at all, but use ?mule? throughout without further
distinction.
It must, however, be said that in the given context of the risk of death
for a pregnant female ?hinny?, N?laka??ha?s elucidation of the above-quoted MBh
12.138.30cd (= MBh 12.140.30cd) contradicts the one of ?nandabodhendra and
Bh?skaraka??ha. His would point to a mule instead a hinny, as N?laka??ha
uses *gardabha-j?*. If this reading is correct, he seems to have had a
crossbreed between a male donkey (*gardabha*) and a mare in mind. In this
case, he either displays an inaccurate knowledge or shows the same
indifference as the dictionaries do to facts of nature, which were perhaps
dismissed as insignificant. However, in light of what other Indian authors
had had to say on the subject, I have my doubts whether, given the
uncritical state of the edition of N?laka??ha?s commentary (I have quoted
from Pu?e 1932), variants with *gardabh?-j?* would not come to light one
day. Reading gardabh*?*-j?, it would match our hinny from above. Here is
the line, which in its present editorial state runs as follows:
*a?vatar? gardabhaj? a?v? udarabhedenaiva pras?ta iti prasiddham *
?An *a?vatar?* is a mare born from a (male) donkey. It is well known that
[this mare] can only give birth [to a foal] by opening her belly.?
The unsolved question of whether a difference was made between mule and
hinny in pre-modern India still needs to be investigated. I trust it was.
