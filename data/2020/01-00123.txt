*About the book:*
This volume presents several detailed studies of the commentary 
traditions of South India with a particular emphasis on Tamil, but 
extended to Sanskrit and Telugu as well. The importance of commentaries 
for our understanding of classical Indian languages and their 
literatures has long been acknowledged, but rarely have the commentaries 
themselves, especially minor ones, been the subject of systematic study. 
Contributors to this volume begin to remedy this desideratum in several 
ways. Some describe the specific methods employed by particular 
commentators and offer translations of passages, many of which have 
never before been rendered into English. Others examine what impact 
ancient commentators have had on the development of modern philological 
and lexicographical tools. More broadly, the role of the commentary in 
textual exegesis is taken up by several authors, and, in one case, this 
has led to an extension of the very notion of a commentary to include 
translation. This volume will serve as an important reference point for 
further research into commentarial traditions both in India and around 
the world.
