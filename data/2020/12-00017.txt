[INDOLOGY] Complete form of a shloka
Dear  Colleagues,
Could anyone kindly give the complete form of a Shloka of Adi
Shankaracharya of which the last Stanza is ????????????????.
In this Shloka Acharya intends to say that
I am a Sanyasin,always chanting ??? ?????????? and meditating on Nirguna
Brahman but when that child of divine beauty having colour of the atasi
flower comes to my mind I forget everything and get enchanted.
Thanks in advance,
Regards
