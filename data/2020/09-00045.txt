[INDOLOGY] Vedic Sakhas
Dear list,
does anybody know where one can order the following book?
Vedic Sakhas: Past, Present, Future (Harvard Oriental Series Opera 
Minora 9: Proceedings of the Fifth International Vedic Workshop, 
Bucharest 2011).
I know that it was distributed by "South Asian Books" until recently (?) 
but neither the publisher's homepage nor the shop on Amazon are 
accessible/there anymore...
Thanks and best regards
Tim
