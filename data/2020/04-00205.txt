Thanks, Dick, for these references.  Kellogg's observation goes in line
with mine that the ??/?? begin to appear in Marathi largely during the
Shivaji-Peshwa period.  However, an occasional use of the forms ????/????
is seen in J??ne?var?.  In his famous Pas?yad?na, J??ne?vara uses ?????
???? ????????? ?????? ????, where the form ????? coordinates with ????, the
latter being the more standard form for the period.  Best,
Madhav
