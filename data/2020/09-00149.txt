Thank to Jim, Peter, and now Dominik,

Somehow I missed this new capability of XeLaTex. I have been using TeXShop and TeXlive on Mac all along, but I did not realize that the preprocessor was no longer needed if I invoked the new XeLaTeX properly.  I?ll give it a try!

Best,
Tim

Dear Tim,

The good news is that you won't have to retype anything, because the more recent XeLaTeX system can be set up to read Velthuis transliteration and turn it into lovely Devanagari.  Here's a minimum working example<https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcikitsa.blogspot.com%2F2020%2F09%2Fsimple-example-of-using-xelatex-for.html&data=02%7C01%7CLubinT%40wlu.edu%7C6234a563e96347f64ece08d86186e3be%7Cd1a80622a99943e58eb67873905e939e%7C1%7C1%7C637366579262114972&sdata=wrFktqjnI8yxKxmgMXQ9IN5ALHtoq0%2F7VeTFEnBLvio%3D&reserved=0>.  TeX does this in one pass, and the devnag processor is not required.

About the Mac, I'm completely in the dark.  Sorry!  But TeXlive (the main distribution from TUG) does say it works on MacOS<https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tug.org%2Ftexlive%2F&data=02%7C01%7CLubinT%40wlu.edu%7C6234a563e96347f64ece08d86186e3be%7Cd1a80622a99943e58eb67873905e939e%7C1%7C1%7C637366579262124967&sdata=S19KRVIrdMbYbmuxNa4NQS7Mvwt0WGWDyPxZ0Vj2wKI%3D&reserved=0>.
