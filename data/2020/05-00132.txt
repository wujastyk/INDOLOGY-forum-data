Dear Palaniappan,

There are several articles by Masato Kitado dealing with different aspects of the Sa?g?taratn?kara, which may be of interest for you. I happen to have a scan of one of them (see attached).

 

best,
Andrey

Dear Palaniappan, 

 

I just came across this reference in James Mallinson's The Roots of Yoga.

Not a 13th century tantric text theorizing on music but a 13th century musicological text theorizing about a tantric/yogic concept (the cakras).

 

 a passage from a thirteenth-century musicological text, the Sa?g?taratn?kara, on the various emotional states which result from situating the self in the petals of the cakras (2.120?45, (5.3.7)).

Mallinson, James. Roots of Yoga (Penguin Classics) (p. 177). Penguin Books Ltd. Kindle Edition.

 

Sa?g?taratn?kara 2.120?39. The emotional states resulting from situating the self in the petals of the cakras:51 (120?21) Between the anus and penis is the cakra called the Base (?dh?ra), which has four petals. The result [of situating the self] on those petals, Ai??na and the others, [?gneya, Nair?ta and V?yavya], is supreme bliss (param?nanda), natural bliss (sahaj?nanda), heroic bliss (v?r?nanda) and yoga bliss (yog?nanda). In the Base lotus is Ku??alin?, the ?akti of Brahman. (122) When she straightens as far as the aperture of Brahman she bestows the nectar of immortality. At the base of the penis is the Sv?dhi??h?na cakra, which has six petals. (123) In its petals, in sequence from the east, are said to be these results: modesty, cruelty, loss of pride, swooning, (124) scorn and mistrust. It is the home of the power of love (k?ma?akti). At the navel is the cakra with ten petals called Ma?ip?raka. (125?7) In its petals, in sequence from the east, are deep sleep, desire, envy, slander, shame, fear, compassion, stupor, impurity [and] anxiety, and it is the abode of the [pr??a called] sun. At the heart is the An?hata cakra. It is designated as the site of the worship of ?iva in the form of the syllable o?. It has twelve petals. The removal of unsteadiness, clear reasoning, remorse, (128?9) hope, openness, worry, longing, equanimity, insincere religiosity, fickleness, discernment and hubris: these, in sequence, are said to be the results for the self when situated in its petals, starting with the east. In the throat is the place of Bh?rat? [the goddess of speech], the Vi?uddhi [cakra], which has sixteen petals. (130?31) The following sixteen results arise in the self when it is situated in its petals, starting with the east: the syllable o?, the Udg?tha (i.e. the second part of a Vedic S?man chant), [the offering words] hu?pha?, va?a?, svadh?, sv?h? [and] nama?, the nectar of immortality, the seven musical notes beginning with ?a?ja [i.e. ?a?ja, ??abha, G?ndh?ra, Madhyama, Pa?cama, Dhaivata and Ni??da, and] poison. At the uvula is the cakra called Lalan?, which has twelve petals. (132) Intoxication, pride, affection, sorrow [i.e. suffering whose cause is known], melancholy [i.e. suffering whose cause is not known], excessive greed, discontent, panic, the ?wave? (?rmi) [i.e. hunger and thirst, sorrow and delusion, old age and death], belief, faith [and] courtesy: (133) these are the results [of situating the self] in the petals beginning with the east in the Lalan? cakra. Between the eyebrows is the three-petalled cakra called ?j??. [Its] results are (134) taught to be manifestations of [the gu?as] sattva, rajas and tamas in sequence. Next is the Manas cakra, which has six petals. Its results are, (135) in the petals starting with the east: sleep, enjoyment of taste, smell, perception of form, touch and cognition of sound. (136) Next is the sixteen-petalled cakra called Soma. In its sixteen petals are found sixteen parts (kal?s). (137) Compassion, patience, rectitude, steadfastness, dispassion, resolve, joy, laughter, horripilation, tears produced by meditation, steadiness, (138) profundity, effort, clarity, generosity and focus: [these] results arise in sequence in a self moving through [its] petals, starting with the east. (139) In the aperture of Brahman is the nectarean cakra with a thousand petals. It nourishes the body with streams of nectar.

Thank you in advance.
