[INDOLOGY] Source and usage of verses
 Hi Harry,
I've heard it many times in temples across India. 
I have tried to find the source but failed. Some say it is from Guru Gita or even Yajur Veda(!) but I checked two versions of Guru Gita and didn't see it. Yajur Veda is so unlikely I didn't look.
Best,
Dean
