Message-ID: <CAA=_wHdFtCOC7YwZ43RDSYQcq0AKr-3SDd3sG9fC20StvRr7pQ@mail.gmail.com>

The librarian of the French Institute at Pondicherry kindly informs me that
Vaudeville?s 1962 book is still available for purchase at the Institute.

I have now recalled that a revised, enlarged, popularised and less
technical, account of the Duhas is available as the final chapter in
Vaudeville?s *Myths, Saints and Legends in Medieval India* (O.U.P 1996),
with an English translation, but not the Rajasthani text of the ballard.
There is a footnote to this concluding chapter of Vaudeville?s selected
essays by the editor stating that this essay was first published in *Bharatiya
Vidya*,* Munshi Indological Felicitation Volume*, vol. xx-xxi (1960-61),
pp. 225-31. (It can be found on archive.org by searching for Munshi
Indological Volume.) In the Munshi Volume Vaudeville explains that that
1960-61 essay is an English translation of the introduction to her
forthcoming book, Les duha de Dhola Maru.
