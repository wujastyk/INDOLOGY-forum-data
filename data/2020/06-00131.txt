[INDOLOGY] Question
Thanks, Harry, for this info.  I have been getting somewhat contradictory
information as well.  I was hoping to get a referetnce to a Sanskrit text
or commentary that will explain this in some detail.  But so far, I have
not come upon any such original source.  The statement "La mention du *k**?*
*laka *est courante ? l??poque moderne." is also interesting.  How old are
these notions?  Are they limited to relatively late texts?  I see the *k?laka
*in the R?marak??stotra, but there is no *argal? *in it.  So it looks like
there is no invariable connection between *k?laka *and *argal?.  *I have a
manuscript in my hand that has some preamble to the *Vi??usahasran?mastotra*,
that refers to various verses in it as *b?ja, ?akti, hr?daya, k?laka,
astra, kavaca, *and *mantra*.  It does not have *argal?*, and these various
verses assigned these roles are scattered throughout the text of the
*Vi??usahasran?ma*.  I wonder if it means that while reciting the text of
the *Vi??usahasran?ma, *these various steps or landmarks happen.  I was
taught the recitation of this stotra, but the recitation does not halt at
these various verses to perform anything specific. There is something
mysterious to me.
