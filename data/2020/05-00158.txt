[INDOLOGY] search journals Vak and JVSt
Dear all,
does anybody know whether the journals /*V?k */(only 6 vols. from 
1951-1964 appeared) and /*The *//*Journal of Vedic Studies*/ (only 2 
vols. from 1934-1935 appered) have ever been digitized? And if so, where 
they can be found online?
My own search was quite unsuccessful sofar...
Thanks in advance and best regards
Tim
