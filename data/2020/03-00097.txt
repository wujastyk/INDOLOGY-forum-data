Dear Listmembers,
the Sambul?-J?taka (519) is illustrated at a monastery Sri Lanka. 
Sambul? takes care of her leprosy husband Sotthisena in the forest. A 
demon falls in love and tries to catch her but ?akra rescues her.? The 
corresponding mural depicts ?akra as a terrible being holding a club in 
his hands. The Pali J?taka provides no description of a disguised ?akra 
but in the Sinhalese Sambul?-J?taka we can read, that ?akra saves 
Sambul? in the disguise of a terrible being (.../Sakdevraja bhay?naka 
v??ayak ge?a/ ...). I suppose this is recorded in a source of the 
M?lasarv?stiv?da-Vinaya tradition, written in Sanskrit or Tibetan.
Anyone of you came across a similar version of this story, where ?akra 
saves Sambul? in a terrible disguise?
Thank you
Heiner
