Dear Friends,
Beyond the ideas of dramaturgy, grammar, poetry, Ayurveda, military
practice, etc. pertaining to the meanings of ?rama and abhy?sa, I'm looking
for some insight into how they might be similar or different within the
specific context of the Mallapur??a's list of 16 ?ramas, which includes the
term abhy?sa. Typically, it seems to replace ?rama.
For instance, here are 2 examples of "?ramas" from the list:
sth?pita-?rama and ?v?saprera?ik?-abhy?sa.
Are ?rama and abhy?sa interchangeable?
Here is the list:
Sandhesara 1948: 37
ra?ga ?rama
sta?bha ?rama
abhrama?ik? ?rama
 ?v?saprera?ik? abhy?sa
sth?pita ?rama
 ?h?poha ?rama
gocintaka
 laghugo?itaka
 pramad? ?rama
?mardak? ?rama
sth?danaka
 ku??akar?a?ak? abhy?sa
 anyak?tkar? ?rama
 jala ?rama
par?n?roha?a
bhojanordhvabhrama?ik?
The following verse sort of helps explain that it is from practice
(abhy?sata?) of the 16 ?ramas of mallavidy? how one can become victorious
in multiple worlds.
*?ramoya?* mallavidy?y?? kathita? ?o?a??tmaka?
yasya *c?bhy?sato* loke trailokyavijay? bhavet || 10.1 ||
But, I'm still left scratching my chin, wondering if I'm overcooking it.
Looking at the list of *?ramas*, particularly at their groupings-- at a
*?loka* and theme/exercise level-- one wonders why various *?rama*-s are
grouped accordingly. Is it for the meter, thematically, arbitrarily, or
something else? It is not the ordinal sequence because they are each ranked
according to be ?re??ha, etc and also intensity, alpa, ardha, p?r?a, ati.
Or, is there possibly a high order of ?rama that groups the lower order
together? There is a pattern, or so it seems, to the verses outlining the
16 exercises. I'm wondering if I'm reading too much into this. Here is a
sort of logical formula I propose to help understand how I see these groups.
[NOTE: Ex. = exercise / Pr. = practice]
Ex.1-*?rama*   +     Ex. 2-*?rama*   ->    Pr. 1-*abhy?sa*  =  *?rama*
Group.
*ra?ga?ramas stambha?ram*astath? *bhrama?ik??rama?*
?v?saprera?ik?bhy?sas tath?ha? (ya?) sth?pita?rama?

Therefore, the Sth?pita ?rama group includes: grappling, pole climbing, and
walking and focuses on cardio/endurance.
I'm really not sure about this but got to thinking about it and need some
feedback.
Thanks.
All the best,
