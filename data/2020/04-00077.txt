=?utf-8?Q?Re:_[INDOLOGY]_G=C4=81yatr=C4=AB_and_Scifi?=
I am delighted that the topic of science-fiction, my favorite genre, has come up on this list!
Michael, the G?yatr? mantra, or a version of it, is indeed used in the opening credits of the re-envisioned Battlestar Galactica?(a series which is a huge improvement on the original, on which I grew up in the seventies, but for which I still have a sentimental fondness). ?The word pracoday?t?is mispronounced as prakoday?t, presumably because the creators of the series were not aware of how the unaspirated 'c' is pronounced in the standard international transliteration system for Indic languages. ?But it's clearly an attempt to sing the G?yatr? mantra.
The series is rich with fascinating themes, including a problematizing of monotheism. ?The mainstream human culture depicted in the series has multiple deities, and other interesting resonances with non-Abrahamic faiths.
Though it diverges from the topic fo the G?yatr? mantra, others have posted on relations between aspects of Hindu thought and ideas found in popular sci-fi series. ?My own humble contributions to this discourse are as follows:
A piece on Hindu themes in Star Wars. ?It's the second part of a two-part series, the first being on Hindu themes in the music of George Harrison and the Beatles:

I owe the title, 'The Yoga of Yoda,' to Swami Sarvapriyananda, of the Vedanta Society of New York. ?He knew this was a favorite topic of mine and was the person who first encouraged me to speak and write about it.
A further developed series of reflections on this topic are going to be in my forthcoming?Hinduism?in America: A Convergence of Worlds, due to be published later this year by Bloomsbury.
Though Game of Thrones?is technically not sci-fi, but fantasy, I have a piece on Hindu themes in Game of Thrones?that is also going to be in a forthcoming edited volume by Matthew Brake on religion in Game of Thrones.
May the Force be with you!

Dear Michael,
There are various bits of Sanskrit throughout Galactica - at the end of the mini-series, Elosha chants the 'asato m? sadgamaya' (helpfully subtitled as 'priestess chanting in foreign language':-)); the surname of Roslin's aid Billy is Keikeya (close enough to Kaikeya to?make me think:-)); Roslin's medicine is kamala extract - and so on.
I've long been wondering how this made it into the series - so far to no avail. Ron Moore, the creator of this Galactica remake, was a Cornellian, and Cornell has long had a fairly solid Sanskrit tradition - but beyond that I have no idea. If anyone on the List can contribute to this, I'd be most grateful!
(And for what it's worth, I hear the intro as sva?, over two notes, rather than sv?h?.)?
All the best,? ? ?Antonia (outside the US, hence syfy's generosity does not reach me:-(!)

Dear All,We have been talking about the G?yatr? a lot.
As it is the weekend, for your amusement:
The Scifi TV channel is streaming (free) all 50+ episodes of their old "Battleship Galactica" series now:?(https://www.syfy.com/battlestargalactica)
Did anyone notice that the theme song of each episode is the G?yatr?: ?"o? bh?r bhuva? sv?h?(!).? Tat savitur ? pracoday?t"
