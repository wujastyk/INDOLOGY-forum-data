[INDOLOGY] Mayavada (was Lines to an Advaitin)
I would just add that the M?dhvas usually use the term m?y?-v?din to 
refer to Advaitin philosophers. It is clear that it has a pejorative 
force, particularly in texts like the Madhvavijaya (the most famous 
biography of Madhva). The Madhvavijaya makes a lot of the fact that the 
compound can be interpreted as a straightforward statement of the 
Advaitins' position (they are "philosophers who hold that [the world] is 
illusion"), but also with a pejorative sense as "a proponent of the 
fraudulent/false philosophy?. The M?dhvas widely refer to themselves by 
contrast as tattva-v?dins ("proponents of the doctrine that [the world] 
is real" / "proponents of the truth").
Best wishes,
Michael Williams
