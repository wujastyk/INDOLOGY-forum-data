It seems that the1948 ed. of the Candrav?kya-s corresponds in fact to the pages 82-86 of the 1948 ed. of the Haricarita by K. Raja (see below the link, or https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.495181 <https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.495181> - https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.383340 <https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.383340> - https://archive.org/details/HaricaritaByParamesvaraBatta) with some additions (which ones I do not know)
