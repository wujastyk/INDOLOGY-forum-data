[INDOLOGY] History of Indian Glass by M.G. Dikshit (1969)
Dear Arlo,
Thanks a lot for both references! I wasn?t aware of them, of course.
Unfortunately, I wasn?t able to get hold of a pdf (or the actual book) yet, but I?ll surely send it to you (and others who requested off-list) if I?ll find or make it myself in the future.
best,
Andrey
