[INDOLOGY] Help needed translating tantric verse
Dear list members,
Verse 2 of the kuNDalinI stavaH is:
rakt?bh?m?tacandrik? lipimay? sarp?k?tir nidrit?
j?gratk?rmasam??rit? bhagavati tva? m?? sam?lokaya |
m??sodgandhakugandhado?aja?ita? ved?dik?ry?nvita?
svalpasv?malacandrako?ikira?air nitya? ?ar?ra? kuru || 2 ||
I'm uncertain on how to translate j?gratk?rmasam??rit? in line 2.
The only (farfetched thought?) I have is that k?rma  refers to the n??i
that carries the energy that closes the eyes and therefor refers to the
sleeping state, so that the phrase means "who abides in the waking and
sleeping states".
Any help in translating this phrase would be appreciated.
