Thank you, Nagaraj. The manuscript in question is in Devanagari and 
belongs, according to the label, to the Lal Chand library at DAV 
College, Chandigarh, so I doubt if the scribe was a South Indian. I may 
add that it is a few centuries old, dated 1644 CE, though the label says 
?? ???? (for ????) by mistake.
A web search for ????? turns up a very limited number of hits, but the 
first one is similar in context to 'my' manuscript:
 ???? ???? ???????? ??????? ???? ??????? ? ????? ? 1860 ? ???? ??? ?? 
?????? ???? ??? ???? ?
This is from a book entitled ?????? ?????? ??? ?????? (?????? ????), so 
perhaps we are looking at a northwestern rather than a southern phenomenon?
