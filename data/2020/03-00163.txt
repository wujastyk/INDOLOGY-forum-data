Echoing the sentiments of many on this (and other lists):

Nick was a good man and a great friend. Since the early nineties he participated in our Round Tables, and then in the meetings of our Association for Comparative Mythology (<compmyth.org<http://compmyth.org>>), for many years.

I particularly liked his comment (about my myth book) criticizing me that I had quoted him too many times!

We will now publish his presumably last paper, as per his last wishes,  in our myth journal, CM:

RIP !

Michael

I will miss Nick greatly too. I have known him for many years, and he was a good friend. I last saw him late last year in Oxford.

I entirely agree with the very positive comments people have been making. He was a warm, supportive and wise man, and I learned a lot from him.

Dear All,

Wonderful man. He came to a number of our conferences held in Dubrovnik on the epics and Pur??as, and made a great contribution.

Cheers,

Greg Bailey
