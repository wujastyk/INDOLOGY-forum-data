[INDOLOGY] MacDevnag on 64-bit systems
I like and use Somdev Vasudev's Romdev myself, for telling XeTeX how to
turn IAST encoding into Devanagari.  It does a great job.
But don't get it from the indology archive.  Go to Github.  I haven't
checked, but I am pretty sure the Github version is more up-to-date:
   - https://github.com/somadeva/RomDev
The only thing is, you have to download it and install it.  That's quite
easy, if you know your computer well and love reading documentation
(Mmmm).  But the standard TeX distribution, TeXlive, has a ready-made IAST
translator already pre-installed, called, er, iast.  So one can say
Mapping=iast,
and it just works.  No installation necessary.  This iast translator, and
the velthuis one and a Harvard-Kyoto one, we owe to the kindness of Daniel
Stender.
   - https://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/xetex/generic/devanagari?lang=en
But this link is only for interest; it's already installed on all systems
that use TeXlive, so there's no need to fetch it.
Best,
Dominik
