Dear Colleagues,

I feel sorry to inform you of the sad news that Professor Willem Boll?e
(*1927) passed away unexpectedly on 16 May 2020. He remained active as a
scholar until his very last day.

I trust there will be an appropriate appreciation of his personality and
his scholarship in the form of a befitting obituary in a distinguished
journal.

Yours sincerely,
Walter Slaje
