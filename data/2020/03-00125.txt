[INDOLOGY] 1st century BCE
I would be interested in this as well. The so-called
Br?hma?atissa/Br?hma?at?ya famine (b?mi?itiy? s?ya) is supposed to have
happened in the reign of Va??ag?ma?i, in the first century BCE, and it
seems to have been the famine with the biggest imprint on Sri Lankan
historical memory, to judge from later story collections. (As far as I know
the Mah?va?sa doesn't mention it.)
