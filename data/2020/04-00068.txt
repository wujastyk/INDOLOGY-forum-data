Dear Madhav,

I am aware of this, but there is also evidence in non-epic and  
non-puranic works, for example

K?emendra's /Darpadalana /(7.30):

/??o?aprabh?rdr?v iva p?dapadmau/

Or, Somadeva's /Kath?sarits?gara /(5.2.229):

/ubhau kala?apadmau ca ?u?ubhate sit?ru?au/

Or, /Mok?op?ya /5.65.29 (= "/Yogav?si??ha/")

/padm?v iva jaloddh?tau/

Perhaps it is no coincidence that these examples all come from texts  
that originated in Kashmir.

With best regards,
Roland
