[INDOLOGY] A distraction from the Coronavirus
Dear Madhav,
I am aware of this, but there is also evidence in non-epic and  
non-puranic works, for example
K?emendra's /Darpadalana /(7.30):
/??o?aprabh?rdr?v iva p?dapadmau/
Or, Somadeva's /Kath?sarits?gara /(5.2.229):
/ubhau kala?apadmau ca ?u?ubhate sit?ru?au/
Or, /Mok?op?ya /5.65.29 (= "/Yogav?si??ha/")
/padm?v iva jaloddh?tau/
Perhaps it is no coincidence that these examples all come from texts  
that originated in Kashmir.
With best regards,
Roland
