Shandip Shah apparently had access to this text when he worked on his 2004 dissertation, A HISTORY OF THE PUSTI MARGA IN NORTHERN AND WESTERN INDIA (1493-1905)  (https://archive.org/stream/PushtiSahityaEnglish/Creating_a_Community_of_Grace_A_History_djvu.txt <https://archive.org/stream/PushtiSahityaEnglish/Creating_a_Community_of_Grace_A_History_djvu.txt>}. He cites a published edition in a footnote: "Also see seventeenth century Braj Bhasa history of the Pusti Marga written by Vitthalnath Bhatt, Sampradaya Kalpadruma (Bombay: Laksmivenkatesvara Chapakhana, 1893.).
