[INDOLOGY] obituary Rosalind J. Lefeber
Dear Colleagues,
It was a source of great sadness to learn of the passing of Roz Lefeber, moderated only by the knowledge that her passing was peaceful one and a release for her from great suffering. 
Working with Roz on her translation and annotation of the Ki?kindh?k???a was a great pleasure. She was meticulous scholar with a deep feeling for the text and her translations were elegant, as was everything she set her hand to. She was also a sweet and gracious person, a joy to know and a delight to collaborate with. She will be missed.
