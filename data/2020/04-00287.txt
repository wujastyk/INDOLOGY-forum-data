Dear Colleagues,

It was a source of great sadness to learn of the passing of Roz Lefeber, moderated only by the knowledge that her passing was peaceful one and a release for her from great suffering. 

Working with Roz on her translation and annotation of the Ki?kindh?k???a was a great pleasure. She was meticulous scholar with a deep feeling for the text and her translations were elegant, as was everything she set her hand to. She was also a sweet and gracious person, a joy to know and a delight to collaborate with. She will be missed.

Bob Goldman

Dr. Lefeber received her PhD from the University of Toronto, where for a while she also taught Sanskrit.

Volume IV: Ki?kindh?k???a, introduction, translation, and annotation by Rosalind Lefeber. Princeton Library of Asian Translations. Princeton: 1994 (see also the Clay Sanskrit Library edition).
