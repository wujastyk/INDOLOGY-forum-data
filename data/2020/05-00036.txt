[INDOLOGY] Techniques of Blinding
Is ?acid? the meaning of yog??jana?
Meyer translates ?Giftsalbe? (p. 352).
Kangle translates ?poisonous collyrium? (p. 282)
Olivelle translates ?toxic collyrium? (p. 422)
For the meaning of yog??jana in A? 4,10.13, Kangle and Olivelle both refer
to A? 14,1.15, where ?andh?kara?am a?janam? occurs. The preparation of this
substance with the power of blinding is defined there as:
?Dung of Myrna bird, pigeon, Baka-heron, Bal?k?-flamingo, made into a paste
with the milk of the plants Arka, Ak?i, P?luka, and Snuhi, produces a
collyrium that causes blindness and poisons water? (Olivelle 2013: 422).
It is well known that bird droppings consist of uric acid. Their mixture
with plant sap could indeed have resulted in a substance, which might be
seen as a premodern precursor of acid used in today?s attacks going by that
name. Our colleagues focussing on Indian alchemy and medicine will be able
to judge it better.
