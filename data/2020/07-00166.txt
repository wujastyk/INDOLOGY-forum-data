[INDOLOGY] Navagraha worship in Tamil literature
Dear Ofer,
another line of investigation is for you to explore the Nika??u-s, alias 
K??a-s, alias Uricco?pa?uval-s ???????????????, if we use the 
terminology of Mayilain?tar commenting on Na???l 459.
The Tiv?karam enumerates:
35 names for arukka? ????????
20 names for cantira?
10 names for cevv?y
14 names for puta?
11 names for viy??am
15 names for cukkira?
13 names for ca?i
1 name for ir?ku
1 name for k?tu
The Pi?kalam (whose name is known to the Na???l) has usually more names:
64 names for c?riya?
36 names for cantira?
15 names for cevv?y
11 names for puta? (WHY DID HE LOSE NAMES?)
13 names for viy??a?
15 names for ve??i
11 names for ca?i (WHY DID HE LOSE NAMES?)
2 names for ir?ku
3 names for k?tu
I might go on with other k??a-s but this should be enough for arguing 
that there is something worth exploring.
I'll send you the corresponding pages directly in a private message
All the best
