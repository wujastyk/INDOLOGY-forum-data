Halanta words changing into ajanta words during borrowing is typically a
feature of South Indian languages. That ending vowel being u is typically a
Telugu feature.
Samvat is pronounced as close to Samvatu with the lat vowel being nearlly u
in Telugu and some other south Indian languages.
But Samvatu changing into Sammati is uncommon in educated pronunciation.
But possible in the case of a scribe being rustic.
Possible in a Telugu inscription or manuscript.
