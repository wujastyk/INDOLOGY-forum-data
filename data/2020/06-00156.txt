Dear colleagues,

Does anyone have a copy of the Bharatiya Vidya Journal, year 1940-41 (I gather it would be Volume 2). I need specifically Durgashanker K. Shastri, "The Date of the Bhagavata," pp. 129-139. We don't have it in the library, and it does not seem it is on archive.org or hathitrust.

Best wishes
Aleksandar
