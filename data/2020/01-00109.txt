    Dear TEI community,
    We are happy to announce the eleventh issue of the review journal
      RIDE, which has been published since 2014 by the Institute for
      Documentology and Scholarly Editing. This issue is the first in
      the RIDE-series dedicated to ?Tools and Environments for Digital
      Scholarly Editing?. Initiators and guest editors of the issue
are
      Anna-Maria Sichani and Elena Spadini.

      

      The idea behind this new thematic focus in the RIDE-series is
that
      software is part of the scholarly ecosystem and as such should
be
      valued and reviewed. Furthermore, we hope that reviews of tools
      and environments can be useful for those involved in the
creation
      of scholarly editions, to find the right software for each
      specific need.  All reviews reflect a detailed catalogue of
      evaluation criteria
(
https://www.i-d-e.de/publikationen/weitereschriften/criteria-tools-version-1/
)
      and are accompanied by a summarizing factsheet (see "Meta"
rubric
      of each article).    

      

      RIDE 11 issue includes five reviews in English (4) and French
(1)
      that critically assess Tools and Environments for Digital
      Scholarly Editing. For your convenience, this is the table of
      contents:

        critical editions with LaTeX, by Andrew Dunning;
