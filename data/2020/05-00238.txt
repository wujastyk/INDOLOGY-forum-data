Many thanks to Jonathan Silk for playing the k?madhenu (as he so often graciously does)!
Once again, this list proves to  be an invaluable resource.

Dear friends,

On behalf of a colleague whose access to collections is hampered by present circumstances,
I wish to ask if anyone might have an available soft copy of
Kodo Yotsuya's The Critique of Svatantra Reasoning by Candrak?rti and Tsong-kha-pa: A Study of Philosophical Proof According to Two Pr?sa?gika Madhyamaka Traditions of India and Tibet (Franz Steiner Verlag, 1999).

with thanks in advance,
Matthew
