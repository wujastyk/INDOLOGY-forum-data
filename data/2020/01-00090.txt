Subject: [INDOLOGY] Indexes of Citations
Message-ID: <0BCA1C0F-9CF3-4D0D-A1B7-16A3336B2EA7@austin.utexas.edu>

Dear Friends:

With apologies for cross-listing ? and following upon the searchable transcript of Vij??ne?vara?s Mit?k?ar? commentary on the Y?j?avalkya Sm?ti, which Don Davis announced a few days ago, I want to alert you to two Indexes of Citations found in that same text, and another one of Devana Bha??a?s Sm?ticandrik?, perhaps the best Dharmanibandha. You can access them at:

https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/southasia/language-resources/languages.php

Just scroll down to ?Sanskrit? and you will find them. Hopefully, these will be useful for your own research.

With best wishes,


Patrick Olivelle
