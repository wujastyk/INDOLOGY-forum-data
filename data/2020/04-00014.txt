Subject: [INDOLOGY] The Initiative for Fair Open Access Publishing in South Asian Studies
Message-ID: <20987429-203f-d8c2-d2ce-92bb02943f0e@univie.ac.at>

Dear colleagues,

now that we're locked out of our libraries, it's clear how important the 
Internet has become for accessing literature. But even without Corona 
it's obvious that online publications are becoming increasingly 
important. Unfortunately, most publishers still sell our papers and 
books at unjustifiably high prices, and for Open Access publications, 
they impose high fees on the authors.

Many of us have become very unhappy with profiteering and restricted 
access, and that's why we've started the *Initiative for Fair Open 
Access Publishing in South Asian Studies (FOASAS)*. We'd like to present 
to you its first outcome: ?The 2020 Manifesto for Fair Open Access 
Publishing in South Asian Studies.?

In order to promote FOA, we ourselves ? the members of the research 
community ? should take action. We invite everybody to read the 
manifesto and, if you agree, to sign it. You find the text attached and 
online on foasas.org <https://www.foasas.org>; if you want to sign, 
please send your name and affiliation to contact at foasas.org 
<mailto:contact at foasas.org>.Of course, we also invite everybody on the 
list to share their thoughts and experiences, or to report on how they 
have implemented FOA already.

It is our great hope that the initiative will raise awareness for 
forward-looking ways of publishing.


Best regards,
Vitus Angermeier
