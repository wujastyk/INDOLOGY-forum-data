Dear List members,
I hope someone can help me out with a pdf of Gonda's article on ?yatana in Adyar Libr. Bull. 33 (1969).
I am particular interested to know if the use of the word ?yatana all by itself meaning "the senses" is a peculiar development within Buddhism or is already present in the brahma?ic tradition, or is merely foreshadowed in the latter.
With kind regards, Herman
