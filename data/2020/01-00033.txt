[INDOLOGY] Texts about translators and translation?
Dear Prof Nataliya Yanchevskaya,
*A propos* your recent mail on texts on translation in Sanskrit, here is
some information that may be relevant.
The term ?*anuv**?**da*? currently used in the Indian languages for
translation, had a wider remit in  ??stra jargon, and was use for scholarly
paraphrase or citation, and the denotation of translation for  ?*anuv**?*
*da*? is a semantic extension of this idea of paraphrase. Prof Radhavallabh
Tripathi [currently at the Bhandarkar Institute, Pune]has recently written
a treatise on the expanded notion of ?anuv?da? covering paraphrase,
citation as well as translation. His book is in the sutra-bh??ya style,
with an auto-commentary, as well as auxiliary ?parikara-?loka-s?. I had
occasion to see a partial draft of the book. You may contact Prof Tripathi
if his book is of interest. Drop me a personal mail if you need his contact
details.
I noticed that other members of the list had pointed out a few papers that
reflect upon translation *from* Sanskrit. I add some more to that list.
