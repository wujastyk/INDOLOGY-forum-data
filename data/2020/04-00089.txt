[INDOLOGY] Lines to an Advaitin
Friends:
Inspired by Madhav Deshpande and with a long history of my polite confrontations with Advaitins I propose to write 100 lines.
I am a staunch Krishna rasika. Writing in English deprives my lines of the majesty of Sanskrit. However what English lacks in the melody and rhythms of Sanskrit it will hopefully make up in its rasa.
Wait O! Advaitin, before I accept your mayavada
Let me tarry a bit and enjoy the lotus face of Krishna.
Kind regards,
Harsha
