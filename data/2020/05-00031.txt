[INDOLOGY] Techniques of Blinding
Dear Walter, et al.
Yes, the most famous Biblical case (as noted in the German Wikipedia article) is the case of Samson.
Judges 16:21 (the story of Samson)
(??.  ?????????????? ????????????, ???????????? ???-???????; ???????????? ?????? ????????, ??????????????? ????????????????, ??????? ??????, ??????? ??????? (???????????. 
Sample English translations:
21 And the Philistines laid hold on him, and put out his eyes; and they brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did grind in the prison-house.
Judges 16:21 (NKJV) Then the Philistines took him and put out his eyes, and brought him down to Gaza. They bound him with bronze fetters, and he became a grinder in the prison.
Judges 16:21 (NRS) So the Philistines seized him and gouged out his eyes. They brought him down to Gaza and bound him with bronze shackles; and he ground at the mill in the prison.
?Da ergriffen ihn die Philister <https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philister> und stachen ihm die Augen aus, f?hrten ihn hinab nach Gaza <https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_(Stadt)> und legten ihn in Ketten; und er musste die M?hle drehen im Gef?ngnis.?
(Note: the German ?stachen ihm die Augen aus,? while using a verb, stachen, that could also mean to pierce, adds ?aus,? which has no Hebrew parallel.)
In fact the key phrase ???????????? ???-??????? va-yenaqru et-einaiyav is using a verb ??? naqar that allows both the meaning ?gouge out? and ?poke/pierce.? (va-yenaqru: va = prefix meaning ?and?, yenaqru = 3rd person plural past tense, ?they naqar-ed?; et = signals a direct object follows; einav = ?his eyes?).
?????
neqer (masculine noun)  ?puncture; pick, mortise chisel.?
??????
niqair (causative verb) ?to peck, to poke; to pierce, to puncture, to gouge out?
??????
nuqar (passive verb) ?to be pecked, to be poked; to be gouged out?
So while it is commonly interpreted to mean that Samson?s eyes were gouged out, it could also mean that they were pierced. Another masculine noun formed from the same verbal root is ?????? naqar, which means ?woodpecker.?
If one looks at other uses of the verb naqar in the Bible, in Job 30:17 it means to ?to pierce? (the bones). At Proverbs 30:17 it seems to mean ?pluck out? (those who look askance at their parents, the ravens will naqar their eyes to be eaten by young vultures).
