While a bad poet is surely at risk of many calamities, the question really is whether the use unpaninian forms immediately renders a poet bad or not. This question is, I think, also largely treated in Victor D?Avella?s excellent dissertation.

I'm more or less aware of all that the lexicographers have to say on the matter (??la is prescribed by Mahe?vara but commentators on the Amarako?a 2.4.know both s?la and ??la, etc.). I am working on a passage where more?or the less the same variants are available as in R 4.12 and was intrigued?by the fact that ?1, our oldest dated witness (Samvat 1076/1020 CE) has t?la throughout. Other Devan?gar? MSS and the???rada MS share it as well, so it seems that it was intentional and not just a confusion of ??/??.

Although most great poets have used forms that have been subject to criticism and endless debate (this is especially true of K?lid?sa but even M?gha's famed verse on the bells [4.20] drives grammarians mad), it is best for beginners to stick with well-attested grammatical forms and avoid those found in the Epics. Epic forms are of course not wrong, but my impression is that we, as non-??is, have not business using them and?poems containing them would be readily dismissed especially at the beginning stages of composition.? One of the benefits of presenting poetry or other work to the sabh? is to receive feedback for improvement. This has always been the case. Yet criticism and erudition can come in many forms. I always think of Pt. A?janeya??arma's response to my question about the meaning of "fragrant gold" (to paraphrase): any pa??it is of course gold, but a kind pa??it is fragrant gold.
