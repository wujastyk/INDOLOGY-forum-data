With apologies for cross-posting,
Dear friends and colleagues,
It is my pleasure to announce the following publication:
Essays and Studies in the Art of Kucha by Ines Konczak-Nagel and  
Monika Zin. Dev Publishers & Distributors, New Delhi.
This is the first of seventeen volumes scheduled for the series  
?Leipzig Kucha Studies?; it unites some results of the long-term  
research project (2016?2030) ?Buddhist Murals of Kucha on the Northern  
Silk Road?, which focuses on an impressive corpus of wall paintings  
datable to approximately the fifth to tenth centuries CE and located  
in the Buddhist cave complexes of the ancient kingdom of Kucha (Ku?a).
