[INDOLOGY] Nick Allen
Nick was a wonderful friend. I met him in Pune as a PhD student in 2001. He wondered up to me at the Bhandarkar and, with his characteristic high-pitched hum, said ?Mmmmm, is that Soren Sorensen?s Index of Names to the Mahabharata?? A friendship commenced then and there (how could it not?).
Nick was an inspiration to me as both a person and as an intellectual; he was unworried by the fashions of the day, inclusive in his interests, and could walk up a mountain like a sprightly goat after good pasture.
I will miss him.
