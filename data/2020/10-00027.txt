See already in much more detail: Harry Falk 1993, *Schrift im alten Indien*,
p. 255, who, however, only speaks of the *gum*-kara, whereas current
recitation traditions have often gone one step further in strengthening
through a kind of samprasarana this syllable which for metrical and other
reasons is evidently an artifact of the tradition of teaching the text: the
so-called* gum*-kara may, accordingly, sound like "gwam".
See in this respect: Chatterji, Suniti Kumar
1960 "The pronunciation of Sanskrit." *Indian Linguistics* 21: 61, p, 70:
"In Vedic chanting, it is customary to pronounce the Anusv?ra in a peculiar
manner, as a distinct syllable as /gwum/ or /gw?m/. Thus ha?sa /????s/?, or
/?a?sa/ becomes /??gw?ms?/."
Similarly, the modern so-called bhaa.sika-accent for reciting the
Satapathabrahmana is, at closer study, an artifact, probably dating to the
"middle ages" and  later than Bhartrhari, of the pedagogy of transmitting
the text (see very briefly my new preface to *Ideology and Status of
Sanskrit*, Delhi 2012).
Best to all,
