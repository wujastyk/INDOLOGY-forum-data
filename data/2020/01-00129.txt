[INDOLOGY] Bloomfield's Vedic Concordance
Dear all,
those working with Vedic texts may be interested in this resource:
https://github.com/OliverHellwig/sanskrit/tree/master/dcs/data/bloomfield-vedic-concordance
It contains a script which resolves complex citations in the VC and
stores the result in a new file (data/ directory).
E.g.:
original: RV.8.23.22b; 39.8e; 60.2d
transformed: RV.8.23.22b; RV.8.39.8e; RV.8.60.2d
Should make searching in the VC much easier.
The data directory also contains parts of the transformed data in
various formats such as JSON or an R-style data frame, which can be used
for analyzing the data more closely.
If you find errors, please adapt and update the script or send me a mail.
Best, Oliver
Oliver Hellwig, IVS Z?rich
