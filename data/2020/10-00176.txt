[INDOLOGY] Manusmriti ... (Olivelle, J P)
Dear Diego and Don,
Thank you for these helpful notes on an important passage. It comes up in discussions periodically so these notes will come in handy.
Dear V.S.Rajam,
It seems you may have missed the aforementioned colleagues? statements that Manu?s position IS misogynist (meaning hatred or disdain for women), even if this is unexceptional given the historical context. If you are criticizing Dalit rights and women?s rights movements and their critiques of the Manusmriti in your post, let me take this opportunity to kindly remind you that this is an academic and scholarly forum and as such casteism, sexism, and communalism have no place here.
Regards,
Tyler W
