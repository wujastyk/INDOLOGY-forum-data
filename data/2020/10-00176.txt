Dear Diego and Don,
Thank you for these helpful notes on an important passage. It comes up in discussions periodically so these notes will come in handy.

Dear V.S.Rajam,
It seems you may have missed the aforementioned colleagues? statements that Manu?s position IS misogynist (meaning hatred or disdain for women), even if this is unexceptional given the historical context. If you are criticizing Dalit rights and women?s rights movements and their critiques of the Manusmriti in your post, let me take this opportunity to kindly remind you that this is an academic and scholarly forum and as such casteism, sexism, and communalism have no place here.

Regards,
Tyler W

People who hate brahmins use Manusmriti and similar texts as their tools in their politics. I wonder how many of them could read these original texts in Sanskrit. Depending upon the translations, everyone?s understanding and interpretation may vary. It is truly a sad scene.

However, the misogyny of the text is unmistakeable (though hardly out of line with nearly all texts in antiquity) and 9.14-15 seem to (mis-)characterize females generally. However, I would add is that pau??calya here denotes lust or an innate sexual desire for men. While it may sometimes refer to a prostitute, the primary meaning of ?prostitute? (at least in American English) is one who has sex in exchange for money. Granted, there are other meanings, but the money piece matters, I think, because the condemnation in Manu is about women?s temptations and attributed inclinations toward adultery, not prostitution in a strict sense. The passage is exhorting husbands to control their wives (or, more deviously, keep women hyper-occupied, 9.10-12) in order to prevent their adultery. It then justifies this control on the false grounds of women?s innate lechery, fickleness, and general inconstancy.

Because of the lechery, fickleness of mind, and hard-heartedness that are innate in them, EVEN WHEN THEY ARE CAREFULLY GUARDED IN THIS WORLD, they become hostile towards their husband"
>>> 
>>>    I would remark here that although "lechery" is of course entirely adequate, pau??calya>pu??-cal? is literally "one who runs after men," idiomatically and unequivocally a "prostitute," so perhaps something like "whorishness" or "sl at ttiness" may convey more directly the flavour of the Sanskrit word.
