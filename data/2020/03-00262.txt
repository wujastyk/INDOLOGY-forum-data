[INDOLOGY] Retroflexion and gender in viruses
The other issue worth debating is the initial syllable  ??, which
should be long based on the script. In many other Indian languages,
both Dravidian and Indo-Aryan, the initial vowel is short:
???????????  ??????????? ??????????? ????? ?????  ????? ?????
???????????.  The short vowel seems more faithful to English
pronunciation and the Latin original (cor?na).  Is the spelling in
Devan?gar? based on the equivalency of o = ? (?).
All the Best,
Victor
