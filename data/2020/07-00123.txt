Adeline Levivier, Visual Data Manager for the DHARMA project, whom you see in action in this photo, has conceived this cube-shaped tent with movable LEDs and obtained excellent result for photographing copper plates during our fieldwork in Bangladesh last year. If there is interest, I can ask her to write up a description of how to build this very portable contraption.

I don't have thousands of images like you, but I do some manuscript photography in India from time to time.  I've used a downward-facing Nikon on a tripod with a remote shutter release in the past.  Good results, but quite a fiddly setup, and good light is usually difficult.

>> I was truly excited by your note on the Transksribus not so much by the project itself but by the scan tent that they are using. As you may know I have been both an art historian and  photographer of fine arts, of primarily Buddhist art, for five decades and the scan tent they are using with its internal lighting and ease of object manipulation seems ideal for some of our work. To that end I have tried to find one in the photographic equipment market. No luck. Do you have any idea where such a tool might be available?
