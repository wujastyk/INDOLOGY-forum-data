[INDOLOGY] Question about possible herbs in Sanskrit literature
Dear List.
A friend not on the list has asked me the following question:
"A quick question: where can I find out more about
Anjaneya taila chikitsa   ie Hanuman oil massage?
Is this some kind of traditional medical/herbal massage?"
Does Jan Meulenbeld have anything to say about this in his work.
Thanks in advance for any information.
Cheers,
Greg Bailey
