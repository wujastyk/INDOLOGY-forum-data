Dear Colleagues,
I am very pleased to announce the immediate availability of a searchable, digital edition of the Mit?k?ar? of Vij??ne?vara, the twelfth-century commentary on the Y?j?avalkya-dharma??stra. The text in the Nirnaya Sagar edition was transcribed by Amy Hyne-Sutherland, Nikola Raji?, and myself. Recently, Patrick Olivelle took the time to check the transcription and to color code its external citations and authors mentioned. Though we know errors still remain, we hope the availability of this major dharma??stra commentary in digital form will facilitate new and more research in this area and encourage the transcription of other such texts. Kindly let us know if you find corrections to be made. We will make the text available at other repositories in due course.
You can find the link under ?Sanskrit? on the Language Resources page of UT-Austin?s South Asia Institute:

Happy searching,
