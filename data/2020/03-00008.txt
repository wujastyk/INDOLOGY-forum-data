[INDOLOGY] Pali suttas in Burmese alphabet
Dear James,
The Pali suttas and other canonical texts, commentaries, etc., can be viewed in a variety of scripts, including Roman and Burmese, within the Cha??ha Sa?g?yana Tipitaka Version 4.0, which you can download from https://www.tipitaka.org/cst4 (and elsewhere).
Best wishes

[INDOLOGY] Pali suttas in Burmese alphabet
Hi
A colleague not on this list sent me the following question:
"I had a request from someone wanting to transliterate Pali suttas
written in the Burmese alphabet using the roman alphabet.
Do you know anyone who may be able to help with this transliteration
work, or who I might ask for help."
Any suggestions will be much appreciated
Cheers
James
