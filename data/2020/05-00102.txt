[INDOLOGY] Lead cubes with Indic numeration found in Thames River
Dear friends,
Is anybody familiar with the lead cubes in the attached picture? These were
intriguingly found in the Thames River recently. The story from a local
periodical is here:

I imagine these were deposited in the river rather recently, but maybe
someone knows more. I?m curious what the ritual surrounding depositing such
items in a body of water might be.
All my best,
Charles
