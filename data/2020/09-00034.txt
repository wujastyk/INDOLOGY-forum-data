[INDOLOGY] [RISA-L LIST] sources on markers of girls' transition to adulthood
So, for what it is worth, Kull?ka on the MS passage regards the verse to be more of a recommendation than a rule. etac ca yogyak?lapradar?anapara? na tu niyam?rtham. He also puts bit of thought into the term satvara?, ?if in haste? which appears to be rendered as ?sooner? in the translations offered.  Kull?ka  understands that a girl who has reached the  age of menstruation is a suitable bride for a youth who has completed his vedic studies and made his parting gift to his guru since such a  youth should not then delay in entering the stage of a householder. Hence, he says, the term satvara?, ?in haste? is specified.  tribh?gavayask? ca kany? vo?hur y?no yogyeti g?h?taveda? copakurv??ako g?hasth??rama? prati na vilambeteti satvara ity artha?.
Cheers to all.
