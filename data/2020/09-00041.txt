[INDOLOGY] Random Weekend Scrapbook Request: WSC 10, 1997, in Bangalore
Thank you Dominik -
Anyone have contact information for Shivamurti Swamiji?  I've been to the
web site of Taralabalu Jagadguru Brihanmath (http://www.taralabalu.org/) where
he now is but there is no contact ink.  I've searched elsewhere on the web
as well ... Context of original request:
I was at WSC 10, myself being responsible for the then-new website of RV
and SB, http://vedavid.org/ -
January 3-9, 1997 was World Sanskrit Conference in Bangalore at Taralabalu
Kendra. One India paper (english, TImes of India?  India Herald?) paper ran
several photos on the front pages, especially of one of the main sessions.
I checked available online news archives but they only went back to 2001.
Anyon have way to get a PDF if you have it in your files? Those 7 days
only? Front page?
We are doing a history of computer studies with Vedic, and 1997 World
Sanskrit was a major set of breakthrough presentations on this.  Can I get
a copy (pdf, etc.) of any photos any of you might have of sessions (any)
please?  We need this in the next few days if possible.  We have a small
budget, but if you can get this to us in a few days, we can find a way to
renumerate you.
thanks in advance,
