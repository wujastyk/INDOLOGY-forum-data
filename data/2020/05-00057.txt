Dear List members,
In Kau?ilya's Artha??stra the duties of the dy?ta adhyak?a is dealt with in Book 3 immediately after that of the dharmastha. I suspect there is a "deeper" relationship involved between dharma and dy?ta than that of law and fair play. For that, see L?ders (W?rfelspiel im alten Indian), who refers to the Vidhurapa??itaj?taka (1227: dhammena jiyy?ma as?hasena) and the Mah?bh?rata (2, 59: dharme?a tu jayo yuddhe tatpara? na tu devana?/ ajihma? a?a?hena yuddha? etat satpuru?avrata?). I wonder if something has been written about this.
