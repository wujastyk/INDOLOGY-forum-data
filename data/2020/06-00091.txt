Dear Harry,
I noticed a few other things. The citation from the Marandand?racamp? for
the meter R?jaha?s? given in the three volume 1959 edition of Apte's
dictionary reads ??????? ??? ?? ???? ???: ?????????????: giving us the
notation ?????, but the printed edition of the text in Kavyamala gives the
reading ??????? ??? ?? ?? ???: ?????????????: giving the notation ?????.
However, the example of this meter given in the text,
???????? ?????????????????????????????: ?
?????????? ????????????? ????? ????: ?????????? ??
fits the notation ?????, indicating that the reading of the definition
given in the Kavyamala edition is faulty, while the reading as given in the
revised Apte 1959 edition is the correct reading.  The revisers/editors of
Apte's dictionary have silently corrected the reading of the Nirnaya Sagara
edition.
