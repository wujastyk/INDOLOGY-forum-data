[INDOLOGY] Scan of Shastri Catalogue
Dear list,
I'm hoping someone on the list has a clean scan of Shastri?s Descriptive Catalogue of Sanskrit Manuscripts in the Government Collection, Vol I: Buddhist Manuscripts. The two scans available on archive.org are, for my purposes at least, illegible to the point of uselessness. And of course under the current conditions I do not have access to my library?s physical copy. 
Many thanks, and good wishes to all,
Ryan
