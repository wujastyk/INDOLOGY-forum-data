Subject: [INDOLOGY] Scan of Shastri Catalogue
Message-ID: <A5B260AC-BB55-4E64-8BD5-BFE4F3ABBF52@berkeley.edu>

Dear list,

I'm hoping someone on the list has a clean scan of Shastri?s Descriptive Catalogue of Sanskrit Manuscripts in the Government Collection, Vol I: Buddhist Manuscripts. The two scans available on archive.org are, for my purposes at least, illegible to the point of uselessness. And of course under the current conditions I do not have access to my library?s physical copy. 

Many thanks, and good wishes to all,

Ryan
