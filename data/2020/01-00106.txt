[INDOLOGY] English short hand?
Dear All,
A Sunday question that I had wanted to ask for long:
Does anyone among you (or your friends) read English shorthand of c.1914?
We have an unpublished translation by Keith of the Ka?ha Upani?ad that he had sent to Lanman in 1914.
Unfortunately it went down with the Lusitania then.
But a handwritten ms. in shorthand survives. I would like to publish it, eventually.
So any help is welcome.
Bess wishes,
Michael
