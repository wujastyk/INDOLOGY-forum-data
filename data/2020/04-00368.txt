[INDOLOGY] Methods for Sterilization and Contraception article
Thank you so much to Mary Rader and Dom Wujastyk.
The correct reference is the Indian Journal of History of Science. Found
here: https://insa.nic.in/UI/journaldetails.aspx?AID=Mw== except for 1968!
But as always, if it can be found online, Dominik will find it.
