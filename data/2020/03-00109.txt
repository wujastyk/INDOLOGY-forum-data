[INDOLOGY] The study of Sanskrit as the epitome of uselessness
Dear Herman
One first thinks of course of Col.Pickering in My Fair Lady (I confess I
have not read the play itself). He is the author of "Spoken Sanskrit", and
thus obviously an object of ridicule.
When I was a child, an expression for something incomprehensible was
"Sanskrit legalese."
When I finally read (part of, I confess) a dharma text, I was
extraordinarily proud of the accomplishment for that reason!
