Dear All,
Apologies if I am asking for too much in my holiday text-hoarding frenzy,
but could someone share or let me know where I can find N?ge?a's Uddyota
(at least for Adhy?yas 2&3) and this article mentioned in Cardona's survey
of research: ?Ramanujacharya, N.S. 1966 "Kriya?-vis?es?an?a?na?m?
karmatvam" [Adverbs as objects], SVUOJ 9 (Sanskrit section): 9-14. [In
Sanskrit]'. I spent a lot of time trying to track this article, but to no
avail so far.
Gratefully as ever,
Radhika
