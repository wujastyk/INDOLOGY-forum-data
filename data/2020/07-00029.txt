[INDOLOGY] request article
Dear colleagues,
I'm looking for G. Jan Meulenbeld, Developments in traditional Indian  
nosology: the emergence of new diseases in post-classical times, in:  
Curare 4,4 (1981), pp. 211-216; also published in: Hans Jochem  
Diesfeld (ed.), Health research in developing countries, Frankfurt am  
Main-Bern 1982 (Medizin in Entwicklungsl?ndern 11), pp. 117-128.
I would be grateful if someone on the list can help me with a pdf.
With best wishes
