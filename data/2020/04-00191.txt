[INDOLOGY] sanskrit and computers?
Dear Amba,
     Thank you for your clear statements.  In my understanding too, it is
not the Sanskrit language as such, but the theories of language developed
by Indian grammarians and philosophers that are useful in NLP.  In popular
statements, this distinction gets lost and claims about Sanskrit language
get circulated.  Best wishes,
