[INDOLOGY] pdf request
Dear Colleagues,
I am in need of copies of the following two fairly short books by Jan Gonda:
Gonda,Jan. 1966. Loka:  World and Heaven in the Veda. Amsterdam:
Noord-Hollandiche U. M.
Gonda, Jan. 1967.  The Meaning of the Sanskrit Term Dhaman. Amsterdam:
Royal Netherlands Academy.
Would any of you have a copy of one or the other, or both? I would
greatly appreciate copires.
