Indeed, it is not rare at all. Here are some examples from a 15th century
text from Kashmir authored by ?r?vara. In his *Jaina-Tara?gi??* he quotes
his own cannon eulogy composed on the occasion of his public consecration
of Sul??n Zayn?s brand-new artillery pieces, and also quotes a dialogue
with benedictive usage which immediately preceded the preparations for the
Battle of Malla?il? in the year 1452:
1) *kriy?t* (benedictive 3rd person singular ?*k?*)
[?] *yantratantrai?*
*sthir?? prati??h?? kriy?t sa Maya? *|| 1.1.75cd ||
?Would that he [as another] Maya consolidates [his] superiority with [the
help of these] cannon formations.
2) *st?t* (?*as* + ?*t?t*, 3rd person singular imperative termination,
applied however in the sense of a benediction [of cannons])
*kalpa? st?d yantrabh???am idam *|| 1.1.79d ||
?May this cannon last an aeon!?
3) *kriy??* (benedictive 2nd person singular ?*k?*)
*tvam ev?ka??aka? r?jya? kriy? dharmakriy? bhajan |*
*vairi?o vimukh? y?ntu ra?e labdhapar?bhav??* || 1.1.113 ||
?May you alone, pursuing lawful acts, rule a kingdom free of enemies! May
[your] enemies suffer defeat in the encounter [and] take to flight, with
their faces averted!?
