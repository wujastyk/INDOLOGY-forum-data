[INDOLOGY] sanskrit and computers?
Backus-Naur notation is often cited as a re-discovery of P??ini's
notational methods, not entirely without justification. This 1967 letter in
CACM by Ingerman started this particular hare:
https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/363162.363165.  Ingerman's assertion rests
on a simplified view of how P??ini's grammar works, ignoring many features
such as rule-ordering, blocking, and scoping.  Nevertheless, the general
idea of BNF-style rewriting rules is there.
