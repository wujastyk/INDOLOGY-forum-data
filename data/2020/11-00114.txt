While Professor Dhadphale's etymology for *vekura?ja <dvaikulajanya *connects
*?ja *with *janya*, I have observed another Sanskrit usage with *j?a* that
may be of some interest. The word *svopaj?a* is conventionally used for
self-authored commentaries and one can see this word in numerous
publications.  Offhand, I don't know how old this expression is, and I have
not seen any traditional explanation of the word *svopaj?a*.  It seems to
me that the component *upaj?a *in this word makes better sense with the
verb *upaj?yate* than with *upaj?n?ti*.  So here we have a possible
instance of *j?a* in the sense of *janya*. Just an early morning thought.
