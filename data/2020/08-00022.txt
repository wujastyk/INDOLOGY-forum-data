(With apologies for cross-posting:)
I am delighted to announce that my edition and translation of 
Balabhadra's H?yanaratna (1649), the first-ever scholarly volume on 
Sanskritized Perso-Arabic (T?jika) astrology, has just been made 
available under Open Access:
https://brill.com/view/title/57015
The hardback version will be available in another couple of days.
Best wishes,
