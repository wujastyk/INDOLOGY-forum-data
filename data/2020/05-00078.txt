=?utf-8?Q?Re:_[INDOLOGY]_ko=C5=9Ba_or_ko=E1=B9=A3a=3F?=
In his Indian Lexicography Claus Vogel points to Amarako?a 3.3.221 (sometimes 3.3.222 in some editions) and the commentaries that seems to justify the spelling ko?a. See Vogel: Indian Lexicography (1st edition), p. 303, note 1 (at this moment I don?t have access to the 2nd edition).
Hope it helps,
