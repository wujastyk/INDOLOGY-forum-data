Then I saw "-ko?a" on the title page of Ingalls's Subh??itaratnako?a <https://archive.org/details/ananthologyofsanskritprosepoetrysubhashitaratnakoshakosadanielingallsh.h.univers/page/n2/mode/2up>.

In his Indian Lexicography Claus Vogel points to Amarako?a 3.3.221 (sometimes 3.3.222 in some editions) and the commentaries that seems to justify the spelling ko?a. See Vogel: Indian Lexicography (1st edition), p. 303, note 1 (at this moment I don?t have access to the 2nd edition).

Hope it helps,
