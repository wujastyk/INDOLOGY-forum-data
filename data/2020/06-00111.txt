[INDOLOGY] Jivanandavidyasagar's commentaries
Unfortunately, the website says "all rights reserved" on each page, so
nobody can use these texts or fonts.  The website *also* has the Creative
Commons logo, which means the opposite.  So the website is giving
self-contradictory information about rights.
