Subject: [INDOLOGY] request from V Narayana Rao
Message-ID: <1D839901-8037-472E-B550-0E80DEBE867A@gmail.com>

Dear Colleagues, 

I am posting here an inquiry from V. Narayana Rao, who is not a member of the list and who asks your help in the following: 

> I  have a comprehensive reference and teaching grammar of Telugu on which I have been working for the last two decades. Could any of the members of the list suggest a possible publisher for this manuscript, which is practically camera ready? 

I have forwarded him the information regarding Dr. Zydenbos?s recent publication of the Kannada primer, and relevant contact to that end, but if anyone has other information or ways to assist, please contact him directly at: vnrao at wisc.edu, or velchheru.rao at icloud.com

With best wishes,

Adheesh
