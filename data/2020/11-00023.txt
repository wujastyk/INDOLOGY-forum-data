[INDOLOGY] CfA: Postdoctoral Fellowship in Sanskrit Poetics
Dear all,
Just to be completely clear for the entire list: Yigal Bronner has
clarified that there is no "internal candidate," and that applications are
very much welcomed from anyone, anywhere, especially in light of the
specific set of skills involved in the project. If you are interested in
applying and have concerns about the start date, you can contact Professor
Bronner directly.
Thanks Jonathan for raising this concern.
