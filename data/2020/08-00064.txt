[INDOLOGY] article search
Dear friends,
Might anyone be able to help me with this article from the JASB?
Roerich, G. N.
1942 The Epic of King Kesar of Ling, Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, VIII, 7, pp. 277-311.
(another bibliography I have consulted gives 'JASB 1942 3.8 letters', with the same pagination)
I have been only able to locate it on a paywall site - southasiaarchive.com - that requires a library membership.
with thanks in advance,
Matthew
