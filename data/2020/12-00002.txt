[INDOLOGY] Sergey Kullanda (1954-2020)
Dear All,
I regret to inform you that Sergey Kullanda, expert of Iran, Scythians,
Indonesia, passed away in Moscow yesterday. He had been a visiting scholar
at the IIAS/Leiden University, ca. 2009, and is author, inter alia, of
Indo-European 'Kinship Terms' Revisited. ? *Current Anthropology*, Vol. 43,
no. 1, February 2002, pp. 89?111.

Sergey Kullanda's death was apparently covid-related, although he was not
well for the last few years. We are missing a great scholar and fine human
being.
