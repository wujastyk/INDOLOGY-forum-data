Dear Michael,
Congratulations to you and all the distinguished contributors! I have been
eagerly awaiting the publication of this book for a while and am delighted

the treasure trove of narratives concerning the tremendous variety of
goddess-traditions spread out all over the subcontinent.
Looking forward to purchasing my personal copy.
