Subject: [INDOLOGY] English-sanskrit grammatical terms list or book
Message-ID: <CAJ3b0o8Zi7M57QHdmgEO5UphQp-K84Z=hRF=F57gC0j8v_b8Fg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list members,

Does anyone have or know of books or resources that relate western
grammatical terms for sanskrit to their sanskrit equivalents . Something
like Abhyankar's Dictionary of Sanskrit Grammar, but in the reverse
direction, english to sanskrit.

Thanks,
Harry Spier
