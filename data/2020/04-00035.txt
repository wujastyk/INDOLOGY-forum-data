[INDOLOGY] English-sanskrit grammatical terms list or book
Dear list members,
Does anyone have or know of books or resources that relate western
grammatical terms for sanskrit to their sanskrit equivalents . Something
like Abhyankar's Dictionary of Sanskrit Grammar, but in the reverse
direction, english to sanskrit.
Thanks,
Harry Spier
