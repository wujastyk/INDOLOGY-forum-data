Subject: [INDOLOGY] Terminology in Monier-Williams dictionary

Dear list members,
About 36 definitions in Monier-Williams dictionary are prefixed with "(only
L.)".  Does this have a different meaning than his use of the abbreviation
"L."

I was under the impression that the abbreviation "L." also meant that
the meaning was only found in the lexicons.

For example one of the definitions for s?ra?ga in Monier-williams is:

(only L. , ?an elephant; lion; cloud; tree; umbrella; parasol; garment;
clothes; hair; lotus; flower; conch-shell; sort of musical instrument;
ornament; jewel; gold; a bow; sandal; camphor; the earth; light; night?)

The corresponding entry in Bohtlink-Roth lists the lexicons.

Thanks,
Harry Spier
