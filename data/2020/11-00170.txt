[INDOLOGY] Academia.edu and privacy issues
I just read that same page <https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en>,
Harry.  I think what they are saying in the passage you cite is that they
store our emails (etc.).  Which of course they do.  I have millions of
emails, going back decades, and they're all in Google's cloud, not on my
laptop.
But the same page seems very clear (to me) that they do not share any
actual content with anyone, without our explicit permission.
Best,
Dominik
