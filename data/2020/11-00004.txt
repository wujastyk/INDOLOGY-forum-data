Dear List Members,
dear doctorate students and young graduate scholars of Indology,

Please note that the deadline for the sbmission of abstracts is
the end of January 2021, not 2020, of course. We are sorry for this 
mistake in the CfP.
So, if you wish to present a paper at IIGRS 12 please submit a 300-word 
abstract to iigrsuk at googlemail.com by
31st of January 2021. You will be notified about the outcome of your 
application in mid-February.

Best wishes
