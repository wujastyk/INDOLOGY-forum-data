[INDOLOGY] once again, a scan?
dear Christophe, dear Friends
Until today I would have rather smuggly said that I am not a total disaster
at finding things online. You have kindly and gently shown me that I was
wrong. Virtually everything I looked for was somewhere, and in most cases
somewhere I *thought* had looked properly. sacr? bleu!
My sincerest thanks!
