[INDOLOGY] "Psychological complexity" of Sanskrit language/literature
Dear Antonia and Professor Deshpande,
Thank you very much for your replies. These are indeed wonderful
examples of "psychological precision" of Sanskrit.
I even wonder whether we need to go into such details as physical symptoms
of emotion, when, for instance, we have a number of words in Sanskrit, that
in English (and most other modern languages) would be rendered simple by
"love" (and equivalents in other languages).
Professor Minoru Hara in the paper "Words for love in Sanskrit"
https://www.jstor.org/stable/41913379
   -
lists and discusses eight of them: *k?ma*, *sneha*, *preman*, *pr?ti*,
*pra?aya*, *v?tsalya, bhakti*, *maitr?,*
and adds that "there still remain many words which are translatable as
"love"", for instance *anur?ga*, *rati*, *sauh?rdya*,  *h?rda*.
He concludes that it is "just a modest approach to the problem", and a
systematic study is a desideratum.
These are all different types, shades, tinges and forms of love (or is
"love" just one instance of those?), and as such these are distinct
psychological phenomena.
Kind regards,
Gleb Sharygin
