>From a first search for, I found the same verse in S?ya?a's commentary on the Va??abr?hma?a (ed. A.C. Burnell, Mangalore, 1873), p. 2 of the bh??ya

https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_m0ujDETV2QkC/page/n53

with the variant in d "nama [sic] devat?" and the note by Burnell: "I cannot identify this piece of insolence. It is always in the mouths of S. Indian Brahmans."

The verse is also to be found in (the same) S?ya?a's Subh??itasudh?nidhi (crit. ed. K. Krishnamooorthy, Dharwar, 1968, p. 22, 5.5,  with the variant in d "daivata? mahat": https://archive.org/details/21subhashitasudhanidhiofsayanacarya_201908/page/n25 ), which itself relies on the earlier (13th-14th c.?) South-Indian anthology S?ktiratnah?ra (ed. K. Sambasiva Sastri, TSS 141, 1938, p. 6, 5.5, with the same variant in d "daivata? mahat": https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.284105/page/n21 - https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.493619/page/n27 )

(unfortunately, the MSS has not reached the letter d).

Would somebody be aware of other, and especially earlier, occurrences in Sanskrit literature of this "traditional" verse (e.g. here quoted in a Tamil brahmins forum: https://www.tamilbrahmins.com/threads/temple-renovations.27311/  - note that the last p?da "br?hma?o mama daivatam" = also Vi??udharma 52.20 ed. Gruenendahl on GRETIL).

Thank you for any additional information,

With best wishes,

Christophe
