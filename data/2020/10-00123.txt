Dear colleagues,

Many thanks to Patrick McCartney, Cristophe Vielle, Martin Straube, Lubom?r Ondra?ka, Asko Parpola, Klaus Karttunen, Dan Lusthaus, Steve Farmer, Peter Wyzlic and Dominik Wujastyk for their responses to my request for materials about mosquitoes and disease-bearing insects. As ever, I am bowled over by the generosity of the list?s members.

Yours, with best wishes,

Jim

Ken Zysk and Rahul Peter Das have both written about contagion in the classical texts, while one can also point to the contagious transmission of syphilis mentioned by Bh?vami?ra in his Bh?vaprak??a (16 cent.).
> Having a medical system that explains disease in terms of individual constitutions raises a difficulty for physicians when faced with finding an explanatory model for epidemic disease (janapadoddhva?sa), where everyone comes down with the same symptoms in spite of being different people.  In this case, the explanation is that the shared environment is blighted. (Caraka offers a chapter that has much in common with the Hippocratic treatise "Airs, Waters, Places" as Zysk has discussed.)  And one of the elements in that blight is mosquitoes.  In my essay "Models of Disease in Ayurvedic Medicine" I go into this and give more detail (pp. 46-8 of the published version).

But NB his correct suggestion that none of these link disease transmission to mosquitoes or other insects. That only came following Sir Patrick Manson?s work in China in the late 1870s on mosquitoes as a vector for human filariasis,  Charles Finlay?s early work on yellow fever in Cuba starting in 1881 ? which initially was widely ridiculed ? and finally Ronald Ross?s work in the Indian Medical Service in the 1890s, which definitively identified the malarial parasite in the gut of mosquitoes transmitting the disease.

A great account by Ross of his work on mosquitoes and malaria ? and his life in India as well, where he was born ? is found in his massive (and wonderfully eccentric) 1923 memoirs, which you can find scanned in online here:  https://tinyurl.com/yxo7taao <https://tinyurl.com/yxo7taao>

A PubMed key word search I made this morning on India, mosquitoes, and malaria ? leaving aside all other mosquito-transmitted viruses now known (e.g., Zika, West Nile virus, Chikungunya virus, dengue, yellow fever, etc.) ? came up with over 4000 titles, going back to an 1899 article in the Indian Medical Gazette entitled ?The Extermination of Mosquitoes,? which refers to Ross?s revolutionary work.

For a fine account of that literature, see Jessica Howell?s new book from Cambridge U. Press (2019), Malaria and Victorian Fictions of Empire.

So mosquitos and snakes ? one causing temporary discomfort, and the other more dangerous because of lethal venom ? were not considered disease transmitters per se.

>> What is the characteristic (laksana) of matter? Change is the characteristic of matter. It has two forms: change in contact and change in localization. What is change in contact? It is the alteration caused by contact by a hand, a foot, a stone, a weapon, a stick, cold, heat, hunger, thirst, a mosquito, a gadfly, a snake, a scorpion, etc. What is change in localization? It is the imagination of form, through determined or undetermined mental conception, as such and such or some such other form.
