[INDOLOGY] Mosquitoes
Dear colleagues,
Many thanks to Patrick McCartney, Cristophe Vielle, Martin Straube, Lubom?r Ondra?ka, Asko Parpola, Klaus Karttunen, Dan Lusthaus, Steve Farmer, Peter Wyzlic and Dominik Wujastyk for their responses to my request for materials about mosquitoes and disease-bearing insects. As ever, I am bowled over by the generosity of the list?s members.
Yours, with best wishes,
Jim
