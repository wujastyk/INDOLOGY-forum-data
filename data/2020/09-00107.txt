[INDOLOGY] Question
Hello,
you may also want to have a look at the Dh?tup??ha commentaries on bh?
satt?y?m. pratibh? is brought up there as well: p. 6 of K??ratara?gi?? (ed.
Liebich) and p. 74 of M?dhav?yadh?tuv?tti (Mysore edition, 1984); they also
do not seem to allow for the alternative forms.
All the Best,
Victor
