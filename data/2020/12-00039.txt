Dear Artur,

I didn?t quite understand your initial query. I now realise that some of these at least are the abbreviations used in the critical apparatus of the Buddha Jayanti Tripi?aka edition of the Pali canon published in Sinhala script.

These are explained as follows at the beginning of each volume:

  *   s? = t?lapa??a-potthaka? (which I take to indicate a reading found in some manuscripts in Sinhala script)
  *   s?mu = s?halakkhara-muddita-potthaka? (indicating a reading found in some printed editions in Sinhala script)
  *   sy? = sy?makkhara-muddita-potthaka?  (indicating a reading found in some printed editions in Siamese script)
  *   machasa? = maramma-cha??hasa?g?ti-pi?aka-potthaka?  (indicating the reading found in the Burmese 6th Council edition)

kesuci presumably indicates a reading found 'in some' manuscripts/editions
bahusu presumably indicates a reading found 'in many/most' manuscripts/editions

I am not immediately sure of the others.

Best wishes,

Rupert

Dear List,

Is my question on the meaning of these Pali abbreviations pointless ? and therefore not deserving of an answer?

Greetings,
Artur Karp

I would be very grateful for the explanations of these shortcuts.
