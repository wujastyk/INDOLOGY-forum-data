I have written the following on this topic in the joint paper by Asko Parpola & Juha Janhunen, ?On the Asiatic Wild Asses and Their Vernacular Names?, pp. 59-124 in: Toshiki Osada & Hitoshi Endo (eds.), Linguistics, Archaeology and the Human Part: Occasional Paper 12, Kyoto: Indus Project, Research Institute for Humanity and Nature, 2011; reprinted, pp. 59-124 in: Toshiki Osada & Hitoshi Endo (eds.), Current Studies on the Indus Civilization, vol. IX, New Delhi: Manohar, 2012.

Page 111, note 94. Another reason is Balar?ma?s great strength (bala-). The stem of the palmyra palm is hard as stone, and the Buddha as a young prince alone among several contestants was able to pierce seven palmyra palms that stood in a row with a single arrow (cf. Maha?vastu 2 p. 75-76 & Lalitavistara 2, p. 155; this episode of the Buddha's life is depicted both in cave 16 at Ajan?t?a? and in Borobud?ur, and the trees depicted are clearly palmyra palms). In Ra?ma?yan?a 4,11,47 - 4,12,9, Ra?ma performs the same feat. Many manuscripts here have ta?la instead of sa?la in the critical edition and Lefeber's translation (cf. Lefeber 1994: 77-78 and 224-226; sa?la is Shorea robusta). It is undoubtedly for such a reason that also Bhi?s?ma (cf. Maha?bha?rata 6,44,48) and Kr?s?n?a (Maha?bha?rata 16,4,5) are said to have the palmyra palm as the emblem on their banner. (See Syed 1990: 311-314 and 323-324 with Abb. 14.6-7.) 

With best wishes, Asko

I'm more or less aware of all that the lexicographers have to say on the matter (??la is prescribed by Mahe?vara but commentators on the Amarako?a 2.4.know both s?la and ??la, etc.). I am working on a passage where more or the less the same variants are available as in R 4.12 and was intrigued by the fact that ?1, our oldest dated witness (Samvat 1076/1020 CE) has t?la throughout. Other Devan?gar? MSS and the ??rada MS share it as well, so it seems that it was intentional and not just a confusion of ??/??.

Although most great poets have used forms that have been subject to criticism and endless debate (this is especially true of K?lid?sa but even M?gha's famed verse on the bells [4.20] drives grammarians mad), it is best for beginners to stick with well-attested grammatical forms and avoid those found in the Epics. Epic forms are of course not wrong, but my impression is that we, as non-??is, have not business using them and poems containing them would be readily dismissed especially at the beginning stages of composition.  One of the benefits of presenting poetry or other work to the sabh? is to receive feedback for improvement. This has always been the case. Yet criticism and erudition can come in many forms. I always think of Pt. A?janeya ?arma's response to my question about the meaning of "fragrant gold" (to paraphrase): any pa??it is of course gold, but a kind pa??it is fragrant gold.
