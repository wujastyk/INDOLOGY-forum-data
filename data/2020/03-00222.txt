I have written the following on this topic in the joint paper by Asko Parpola & Juha Janhunen, ?On the Asiatic Wild Asses and Their Vernacular Names?, pp. 59-124 in: Toshiki Osada & Hitoshi Endo (eds.), Linguistics, Archaeology and the Human Part: Occasional Paper 12, Kyoto: Indus Project, Research Institute for Humanity and Nature, 2011; reprinted, pp. 59-124 in: Toshiki Osada & Hitoshi Endo (eds.), Current Studies on the Indus Civilization, vol. IX, New Delhi: Manohar, 2012.
Page 111, note 94. Another reason is Balar?ma?s great strength (bala-). The stem of the palmyra palm is hard as stone, and the Buddha as a young prince alone among several contestants was able to pierce seven palmyra palms that stood in a row with a single arrow (cf. Maha?vastu 2 p. 75-76 & Lalitavistara 2, p. 155; this episode of the Buddha's life is depicted both in cave 16 at Ajan?t?a? and in Borobud?ur, and the trees depicted are clearly palmyra palms). In Ra?ma?yan?a 4,11,47 - 4,12,9, Ra?ma performs the same feat. Many manuscripts here have ta?la instead of sa?la in the critical edition and Lefeber's translation (cf. Lefeber 1994: 77-78 and 224-226; sa?la is Shorea robusta). It is undoubtedly for such a reason that also Bhi?s?ma (cf. Maha?bha?rata 6,44,48) and Kr?s?n?a (Maha?bha?rata 16,4,5) are said to have the palmyra palm as the emblem on their banner. (See Syed 1990: 311-314 and 323-324 with Abb. 14.6-7.) 
With best wishes, Asko
