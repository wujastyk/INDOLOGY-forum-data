[INDOLOGY] Texts about translators and translation?
Dear All,
Thank you very much for your responses on- and off-list!
It seems that we indeed don't have much Sanskrit material on the topic but
at least now my student has something to start with. If by any chance
something else comes to mind, please do let me know.
Thanks again,
Nataliya
