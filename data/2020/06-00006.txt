Help with book
Dear colleagues,
I would be very grateful if you could provide me with a pdf of the following book:
Pal, Pratapaditya. Indian Painting: A Catalogue of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art Collection Vol.1, 1000-1700, 1993.
Although our library has a copy, obviously I can't consult it at the moment.
Best wishes,
Camillo
