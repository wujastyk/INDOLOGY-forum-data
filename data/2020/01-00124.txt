*PhD position in Buddhist Studies *



Khyentse Foundation announces the availability of support for a 4-year PhD
position at Leiden University in Buddhist Studies. The successful candidate
will carry out research on a theme in Buddhist Studies under the
supervision of Prof. dr. Jonathan A. Silk.



Buddhist Studies at Leiden University focuses in the first place on Indian
Buddhism, and on preparing scholars to edit, translate and study Buddhist
scriptures, chiefly Mah?y?na s?tras. Although any topic within Buddhist
Studies is possible, preference will be given to candidates who wish to
focus on an area of special interest to Prof. Silk, which normally might
include work on an edition and critical study of one or more Mah?y?na s?tras.
However, other approaches will be considered, and if you are interested, by
all means apply with your idea for another type of project.



The successful applicant will have high level knowledge of the relevant
Buddhist languages, optimally Chinese, Tibetan and Sanskrit.



*Key responsibilities*

   - Write a PhD thesis
   - Participate in team activities
   - Disseminate your research to non-academic parties and on social media



*Selection Criteria*

   - An MA degree in Buddhist Studies or a relevant degree
   - Sufficient command of the relevant languages to engage in research
   - Ability to communicate in written and oral academic English
   - Commitment to high-quality research, publication, and dissemination
   - Ability to plan and execute tasks independently and punctually
   - Ability to work as part of a larger team.



*The Leiden Situation*

bachelor?s programmes for over 7,000 students based at locations in
Leiden?s historic city centre and in modern buildings in The Hague.  For

The PhD candidate will work in the Leiden University Institute for Area
Studies (http://www.hum.leiden.edu/lias/). LIAS is comprised of a School of

Prof. Silk currently heads an ERC-funded project called "Open Philology," (

Buddhist scriptures, in the first place the Mah?ratnak??a collection of 49
s?tras. His team at present comprises 3 post-doctoral fellows, a
programmer, and 2 PhD students, along with other PhD students not employed
by the project. The overall environment is a vital and active one.



*Terms and conditions of Support*

Khyentse Foundation offers financial support for 4 years of study, with
continuation of funding after the first year, and every subsequent year,
contingent on good progress toward the PhD degree. Such progress will be
