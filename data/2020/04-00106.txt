Dear Colleagues,
Does anyone happen to have an access to a scanned version of the following
publication:
*T?htinen, Unto (1964) **Non-violence as an ethical principle with special
reference to the views of Mahatma Gandhi**.* *Turku: Turun Yliopisto *
*Julkaisuja*?
I?ve been trying to get a copy, but in vain - at the time when all
libraries are closed. I?d greatly appreciate a copy.
Best regards
Piotr Balcerowicz
