[INDOLOGY] corona deaths
I am also a great fan of the Russian jokes. My great-grandfather from my
mother's side was a Russian and my grand-father from my father's side was
born in Moscow. So I even inherited some of the "pre-revolutionary" jokes
(I do not know how to transcribe Russian into English properly, but I hope,
you know what I mean).
Let's do as you propose!
Best wishes,
Joanna
