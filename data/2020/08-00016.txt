[INDOLOGY] Russian scholarship on Tolstoj and his reception of early Buddhist thought
Dear List Members,
as I am interested in discovering some more about the inspiration Tolstoj
drew from his Buddhist readings, I would like to ask if there is anyone
among you who might recommend some scholarship in Russian - whether
articles or essays - about this topic. As for the writing I have discovered
so far, there's plenty indeed to read, but hardly anything that I would
define as scholarship (Ivan Bunin).
I know the subject of this enquiry may appear somewhat divergent from the
topics usually discussed on this list, but I wish to consult you as well
and not limit myself to the information I can gather from the field of
Slavic Studies. I would be extremely thankful for any suggestion.
With kindest regards,
Omar Abu Dbei
