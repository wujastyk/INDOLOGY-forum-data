Dear all,
Many thanks to everyone who replied on- and off-list!
In addition to your suggestions, I have also been looking at the section
'Transfer of present classes' in Oberlies' Grammar of Epic Sanskrit (2003:
189-202), and Lanman's On multiple presets and on transfers of conjugation
in the Sanskrit verb system (JAOS 13 (1889) XXXVI-XXXIX). It is interesting
that secondary -aya-formations are often excluded from such considerations,
probably because they are automatically assumed to be causatives rather
than alternative (simple) present-tense forms.
Thank you again, and I hope you all have a very good week ahead,
     Antonia
