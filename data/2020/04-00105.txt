[INDOLOGY] (still) no distraction from the coronavirus...
Dear Matthew, Dear Jean-Luc,
thanks for the helpful replies.
As for the problem of: German "?"  (apparently also used to transcribe the
similar Tibetan phoneme) or French "u" or Dutch "uu" into Devanagari and
Indic scripts:
That French "Luc" had become "??????" [l?yk] is quite justified in the
light of the sth?na "place of articulation" of this phoneme unknown to
traditional Sanskrit phoneticians, in between "i" and "u".
When I teach "?" to those unfamiliar with it, I instruct to start saying
"ii", move the mouth slowly towards saying "uu", and "?" will appear
somewhere in between.
In this light the spelling in some modern Indian languages of Paris (as
pronounced in English!) is also understandable: the first vowel is heard as
a palatalized "a".
However, in "??????" [l?yk] the sequence is inverted, going from "uu" to an
"ii" sound (whereas one would like to have the two simultaneously).
As to be expected, students in Heidelberg have no difficulty in pronouncing
'Br?der' as 'Br?der' and 'Fl?gel' as 'Fl?gel':

Even in Maastricht these two words and the '?' phoneme in them are
pronounced correctly:

However, the "distinguished British baritone, Robert Bennington,"
pronounced the two words (that too, long before the Brexit) either out of
inability or to enhance the comic effect, respectively as Bruder and
Flugel:
