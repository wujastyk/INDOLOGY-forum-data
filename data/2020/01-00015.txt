Dear list members,

I've gotten quite a few replies off-line to my question about the form *k?????a
*which I've summarized below.

------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------

??????? is indeed the paninian ????????? ????????? form of ?? ????. I have
seen these forms appear from time to time in stotras, not elsewhere as far
I recall. ??????? makes up the bulk of these occurrences. ?????????? showcases
such forms a few times too.


To add a few more references to your collection:

1. ????????????? (from ?????????, the ??? intensive of ???). Bhamaha quotes
a verse with this to demonstrate the fault of using obscure forms.
2. ???????? seen in Utpaladeva's ??????????????? (?????? ??????????????....
??????? ????????)
3. ??????? in the first verse of ?????????????? (..?????? ?? ??????? ?) in
the version edited by F. Wilson.
4. ??????? ??????? ??????? ???????? ??????????????????????? from a stotra
attributed to ?????
5. Stotra by Vedanta Deshika? "???????????????????????????????? ????? ??????
"

6. Pan?itaraja Jagannatha
?????? ?? ???? ???????? ?

------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------

Here are a few more occurrences of the particular form
that prompted your query, k?????a. It seems to me not all that
extremely rare; apart from the several attestations which you cited,
it can also be found for instance in (apart from grammatical texts):

1) Bilvama?galastava vs. 1 (in the numbering of Wilson in her edition of
1973); the verse ends ... ma?gala? va? k?????a;

2) Ve?kat?dhvarin's famous Vi?vagu??dar?acamp? verse 39 (this is in
the section about Ayodhy?), with the main sentence of the verse being
k?p?rasa? ? k?????a sa ?????ak?t k?pa?ataikat?ne mayi||;

3) the Lalit?stavaratna, vs. 19, see e-text here:
*http://arunambika.ru/shri_lalita_stava_ratnam.html
<http://arunambika.ru/shri_lalita_stava_ratnam.html>*

As for other ?tmanepada benedictive forms, note that the second
person singular form from the same root,
k?????h?s, occurs for instance in Bh?gavatapur??a 10.3.28 and
in N?r?ya?abha??a's popular N?r?ya??ya 11.94.6.

A few examples of forms from other roots in Buddhist texts are
discussed in an article by David Reigle,

https://www.academia.edu/6423804/The_Virtually_Unknown_Benedictive_Middle_in_Classical_Sanskrit_Two_Occurrences_in_the_Buddhist_Abhisamayalankara


More can of course be found...

Several of the examples that can be found are from k?vya, rather than
tantra and pur??a. By the way, somewhat similarly, Whitney, for
instance, says of the 'imperative in t?t' that it 'Later' (i.e. after
Vedic) is very unusual', and that 'According to the native
grammarians' it 'is to be used with a benedictive implication, but
that 'No instance of such use appears to be quotable.' Of course quite
many can be quoted, e.g. the sa?sphurat?t of Abhinavagupta's famous
verse.

We should or course bear in mind that scholars such as Whitney and
MacDonell could not easily and quickly search a large corpus of
texts, as we can.


--------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------


we have m?????a from m? by Pan{1,3,61} and lavi????a from l? by
Pan{3,4,116}.

And allusions by David Reigle on 2 occurrences in Abhisamay?la?k?ra,
........


Gaayatrii dhiimahi precative m. Whitney?837b

ved precative `fasse que je sois lib?r?' muk.siiya

Yes, it is a benedictive ?tmanepada form. See Kielhorn (A Grammar of
the Sanskrit Language, 2nd rev. ed., Bombay 1880, ? 382): sm?, 3. sg.
sm?????a or smari????a; sa?sk?, sa?sk?????a (last example only in the
German edition 1888).
http://archive.org/details/cu31924023200862

According to Thumb-Hauschild (Handbuch des Sanskrit, 2. Teil:
Formenlehre, 3. Aufl., Heidelberg 1959, ? 563), in Classical Sanskrit
benedictive ?tmanepada forms are "even rarer" than the corresponding
"rare" parasmaipada forms.

See also Renou (Grammaire Sanscrite, 2nd ed., Paris 1961, ? 331: "Mais
la formation est ancienne et des pr?catifs de type v?d. subsistent
dans les S[?tras] (notamment ???kh[?yana] ?[rautas?tra]
M?n[avag?hyas?tra]), en particulier au moyen" ("But the formation is
ancient and there continue to be precatives of the Vedic type in the
S[?tras] (in particular ???kh[?yana] ?[rautas?tra]
M?n[avag?hyas?tra]), especially in the ?tmanepada").

. . . .

If Macdonell was aware of the form in the Bh?gavatapur??a, he may have
regarded it as a Vedicism or intended archaism. In classical Sanskrit
such forms are extremely rare, if they occur at all. For some Pur??as
and a certain type of Stotras this may be different.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Renou's Grammaire ?330 (p. 450) "pr?catif" deals with the form: "B. Au
moyen (...). Le radical est au gu.na comme ? l'aoriste moy. en -(i).s-,
sauf que les racines ani.t en .r- pr?sentent le degr? z?ro: k?????a "
