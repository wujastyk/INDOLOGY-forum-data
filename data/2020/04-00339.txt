[INDOLOGY] A distraction from the Coronavirus
Perhaps a little bit sensitive, but I hear the Ganga is much cleaner now.
???????????????? ?????????????? ?????????????????????
??????????????????????? ?????? ???????????

In which serpents, gods and mortals once bathed saying ?It is pure!??
Which has become like poison, helpless against the dumbness of today?s
people?
Now that dumb and wise alike are restrained by a virus,
Look and wonder, Divine River: that water of yours has turned fit to drink.
