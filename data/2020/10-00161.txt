Re: [INDOLOGY] Manusmriti ...
There is no statement of Manu that states all women are prostitutes. There are statements which emphasizes the need for women to be under male control/protection, the need to guard them from even the slightest attachment to sensual pleasure (sa?ga). See Manu 5.148ff, and 9.1ff.

Dear List Members,
I need your help in understanding something from Manusmriti.
Is there any passage/rule in this text that states that ?all women are prostitutes?? Or anything close to such thought?
In Tamilnadu, there is a severe extremist movement wanting to burn Manusmriti. As the next election is approaching, the political scene is getting ugly as usual. One party?s propaganda includes that Manusmriti should be removed/burned down since it looks at women as prostitutes.
I was wondering if any of you would kindly check Manusmriti and let me know if he really declared that all women are prostitutes.
I would very much appreciate your help.
Thanks and regards,
V.S.Rajam
