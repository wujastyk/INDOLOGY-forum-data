=?utf-8?Q?Re:_[INDOLOGY]_ratta-m=C4=81la?=
Dear Rolf,
 raktam?la and raktam?lya occur hundreds of times in about 75 texts in
Muktabodha's searchable e-text library.
1.  Direct link to the library is:
https://etexts.muktabodha.org/DL_CATALOG_USER_INTERFACE/dl_user_interface_frameset.htm
2. Type* <raktamAl**>  *in the search field.  The angle brackets are
required.  They tell the search engine you are using Kyoto-Harvard
transliteration.
3. Click on *search for words in e-texts*.
4.  The lines where raktam?la and raktam?lya occur appear in an upper
panel.  When you click on any of these lines then the e-text opens at that
line in a lower panel.
Regards,
Harry Spier
