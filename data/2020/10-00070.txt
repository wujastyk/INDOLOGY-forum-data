[INDOLOGY] Six calamities
I raise a similar question about the sparsity of epidemics in early literature, in ?Plagues and Brahmins? (Zysk felicitation volume, Brill 2021; has just come out).

Having experienced terrifying wildfires in California, I wonder why this list of ???s did not include something like ??????.  Were such wildfires not that common in ancient India?

Thank you much, dear Peter, for the reference.
Now I can add the following article  by F. Wilhelm in IT, precisely on the topic ("Calamities - a dharma problem?) :

Anyway, the ?loka below (also quoted in a commentary to the final stanza of M?lavik?gnimitra, according to Wilhelm) must be earlier than its occurrence in the K?tyakalpataru and V?ramitrodaya digests.
