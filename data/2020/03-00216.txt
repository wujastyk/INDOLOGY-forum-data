Dear Jean-Luc,
This is as fascinating as it is puzzling.
Have the translations of (parts of) the Tolk?ppiyam by K. Zvelebil ever been published?
See his announcement of a translation in his The Smile Of Murugan, Leiden, 1973, p. 131.
Stay healthy and well in M?ssen,
Jan
P.S.
for the children in M?ssen, during the corona-crisis:
??????????????? ??? ????????   ???? ? ?? ???????? ?
This one I will translate, freely, into German:
"Was kann man machen in M?ssen?
Nur lachen, nicht k?ssen."
P.P.S.
Did anyone ever try to transcribe into Sanskrit -- into Devanagari -- the German "?" or French "u" or Dutch "uu"?
Max M?ller sanskritized his name simply as ????? ???? according to my teacher Prof. Henk Bodewitz in order to suggest to his Indian readers that he can bring them liberation, but in that way M.M. skipped the problem of the transcription of this phoneme that is absent in Sanskrit and in Hindi and in most other Indian languages I know of (but a similar sound is there in Tibetan, if I'm not mistaken).
