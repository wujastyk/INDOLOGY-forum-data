On the topic of, among other things, advocacy within the Tantric traditions
of cultivation, rather than eradication, of emotions, see:

Raffaele Torella (2015): 'Passions and Emotions in the Indian
Philosophical?Religious Traditions', in P. Bilimoria, A. Wenta (eds.)
Emotions in Indian Thought-Systems, London: Routledge, pp. 57-101.
