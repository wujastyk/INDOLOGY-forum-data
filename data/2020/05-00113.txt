[INDOLOGY] Lead cubes with Indic numeration found in Thames River
Dear Dr Jacob Schmidt,
whether they would already have served their ritual purpose (whatever
exactly that might have been)?
As per the occult beliefs around such occult practices, there is no harm
such objects inflict on the person who collects them.
Warding off of the evil (ill fate in this case) which is intended in such
practices is done through two kinds of rituals.
1. Transfer of evil
2. Desruction or  throwing away or washing off
In the method #1, the objects used for the removal of evil eye are believed
to collect evil eye into themselves and are believed to transfer to the
person crossing them over.
In the method #2, the objects used to for the removal of dosha are thrown
into flowing water or any such nature form that can destroy, take away or
wash off the dosha.
The objects found in the present instance belong to method #2 . So, as per
the belief system of their users, the flowing river waters would have
washed off the evil (in this case , ill fate ).
