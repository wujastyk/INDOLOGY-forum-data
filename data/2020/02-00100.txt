[INDOLOGY] help with a name
Thanks, Arlo, for pointing to this difference.  Yes, Raghu Vira is a single
name with two parts without any family name.  I believe I have seen a
citation like "Chandra, Lokesh," but not "Vira, Raghu."  I don't know the
reasons, but would like to know more about how the Librarians generally
deal with these names.
