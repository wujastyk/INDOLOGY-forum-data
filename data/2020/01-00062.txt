[INDOLOGY] unpublished MA thesis
Dear members of the list,
I was working through some readings suggested by Naresh Keerthi in one of his posts to the list?(thanks a lot for this, Naresh!). One of these (RP Das, ?On the identification of a Vedic plant?) mentions an unpublished MA thesis submitted by?Mathias Helmdach to Uni M?nchen in 1980, ?Farbbezeichnungen und Farbverst?ndnis im altern Indien (Dargestellt an Hand ausgew?hlter Werke der altindischen Literatur)?. I am unable to locate it in the catalogue of the university (I thought, I could order a scan), so that I was wondering if any of you may know the whereabouts of the thesis, the scholar, or, what would be absolutely great, may even have a pdf of the study.
Many thanks in advance!
best,
Andrey
