Dear all,
I picked up the Motilal Banarsidass pbk edition of Sandal, a 1999 rpt. of their ?first? 1993 edition, in India years ago. It does not contain an introduction, only a preface that barely spills over to a second page. The rest is entirely a bilingual, non-annotated edition of the sutras, each verse in devanagari followed by an English translation.
