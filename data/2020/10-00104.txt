Subject: [INDOLOGY] Kiranavali scan requests
Message-ID: <CADSGPzUoinsDy+Fzq6A84sZzq+sL+P=D_eZdwod2MrA5Dk7FCw@mail.gmail.com>

Respected scholars,
I am looking for the scanned copies of the following works.

1. Kiranavali of Udayanacharyya, with the commentary of Vardhamanopadhyaya,
edited by Mahamahopadhyaya Shiva Chandra Sarvvabhouma, Asiatic Society
I have a scan from archive, which abruptly ends at 300th page.

2. Any other translations / commentaries / subcommentaries except
kiranavalibhaskara and kiranavalirahasyam would also be appreciated.
