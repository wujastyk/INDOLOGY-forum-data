[INDOLOGY] PDF of Lienhard's Amaru, Erotic and Philosophical
Dear all,
I am sharing a pdf of a German article that appeared under the same title
(Amaru -- erotisch und philosophierend) in the Wiener Zeitschrift f?r die
Kunde S?dasiens, although I don't know whether the 1996 article is an exact
translation of the earlier German one.
Hope it helps.
All the best,
Gaia
