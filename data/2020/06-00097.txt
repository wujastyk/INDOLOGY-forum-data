[INDOLOGY] Moral economy of the Petavatthu pdf
Dear list members,
I am looking for a soft copy of Jeffrey Shirkey's PhD dissertation,
"The Moral Economy of the Petavatthu: Hungry Ghosts and Theravada Buddhist
Cosmology." I would be most grateful if someone could share it.
Many thanks and best wishes,
Aleix
