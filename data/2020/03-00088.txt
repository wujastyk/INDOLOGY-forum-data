[INDOLOGY] request for article
Esteemed scholars, 
For a project I?m in need of the following article by the late Prof. Hahn: 
Michael Hahn. ?K?emendra?s Garbh?vakr?ntyavad?na (Sanskrittexte aus dem tibetischen Tanjur II)," Journal of the European Ayurvedic Society 5 (1997): 82-112. 
Due to the present circumstances I do not have physical access to a university library, and my internet research did not lead me to an electronic version of this discontinued journal. I would be grateful if someone was able to share a PDF copy of this article with me.
Many thanks!
