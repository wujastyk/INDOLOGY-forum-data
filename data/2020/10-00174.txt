Dear Madhav,
Further evidence for *sk?-* with initial s comes from Rigvedic sandhi,
where word-final *-s* is retained before forms derived from the root *k?-*.
Where forms of *k?-* are involved, -*s* is retained even in contexts where
we do not find "close sandhi" in the Rigveda, e.g. between a direct object
and a verb: *kani??h? ?ha cat?ras kar?ti* "The youngest said, 'I'll make
four.'" (4.33.5c).
The same sandhi behavior holds for the bardic family name *k??va-*, where
the *s* is preserved in the Kanvid name *pr?ska?va-*. Likewise in *kav?-*,
where Germanic cognates such as present-day German *schauen* 'to look'
exhibit a root-initial *s*.
For a thorough discussion, you can check this paper:
Hale, Mark. 1990. ?Preliminaries to the Study of the Relationship between
Sandhi and Syntax in the Language of the Rigveda.? *M?nchener Studien zur
Sprachwissenschaft* 51:77?96.
All the best,
Dieter
