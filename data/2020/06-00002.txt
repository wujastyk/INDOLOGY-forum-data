a friend asked me, whether I now the origin of Malraux?s following epitaph: ?The elephant is the wisest of all the animals, the only one who  remembers his former lives; and he remains motionless for long periods of time, meditating thereon.-BUDDHIST TEXT?. It?s in Malraux?s Anti Memoirs.
I have no clue. Anybody of you?
