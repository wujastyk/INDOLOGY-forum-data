Hi Rich:

I have a photocopy of this edition. I could bring it to Boston for the AOS if you can wait that long, or try to see whether I can make a digital copy of it, at least the commentary on the s?tras you need.

Dear colleagues,

Does anyone have a copy, or know of a copy available in North America, of the V?si??ha-dharmas?tra with the commentary Vidvanmodin? by Kr???a Dharm?dhik?r?, published in Benares, 1878 [according to the reference in Patrick Olivelle, Dharmas?tras, p. xvi]? I have been unable to find it via the usual channels.

In particular, I am interested in the commentary on the rules for partition of the estate in 17.40-54.

Thanks in advance,

Rich Salomon
