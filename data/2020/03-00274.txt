[INDOLOGY] Retroflexion and gender in viruses
The Sanskrit o is normally (for exceptions, see Renou G p. 23) long (so for instance in Malayalam, which has both long and short o, kokila or cakora are written  k?kila, cak?ra); in lexical borrowings from ancient Greek it seems that it has normally been used for transcribing long o, cf. hor? from ???, paristoma from ??????????.  For the short o, one finds in Varah?mihira's Hor???stra etc. various treatments like durudh?ra for ?????????, kemadruma for ??????????, harija for ?????? (other examples of Greek short o > Skrt a/? are less relevant if it concerns the endings, cf. lipt? from ?????? <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%BB%CE%B5%CF%80%CF%84%CF%8C%CE%BD#Ancient_Greek>,  j?mitra from ????????? <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%B4%CE%B9%CE%AC%CE%BC%CE%B5%CF%84%CF%81%CE%BF%CE%BD#Ancient_Greek>, kendra from ???????) ? however, there is at least ko?a = ??? <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%BB%CE%B5%CF%80%CF%84%CF%8C%CE%BD#Ancient_Greek>??? ; on the basis of the latter, and of the rendering of corona in the other Indian language, ko- in koro?a seems to me acceptable.
Is there somewhere a complete listing of the Sanskrit lexical borrowings from ancient Greek?
