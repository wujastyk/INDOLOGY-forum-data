Congratulations, Robert! Well done!

Now you have me wanting to learn Kannada. There is a wealth of Jain and Jain-related literature in Kannada, as you know better than most of us.

With warmest regards,
Jeff

Prodding). Kannada is a conservative language, which has remained largely unchanged for the past several centuries. Once one has learnt modern Kannada, it is not a big jump to Old Kannada (yes, it is a jump, but not gigantic).

The focus is on the written language (which is the only truly sensible thing to do, as is explained on pp. x-xi), but there are occasional remarks about speech variations in regional and colloquial usage. The grammar is covered in 19 lessons, followed by appendices about the phonemic system and script, numerals, strong verbs, colloquialisms, and sandhi. Experience has shown that the material in the book can be studied in the classroom with 4 hours of weekly teaching very easily within an academic year (30 weeks of teaching), and a few times this was accomplished with a group of students within a single winter term.
