=?utf-8?Q?[INDOLOGY]_Samprad=C4=81ya_Kalpadruma?=
Dear Scholars,
I am looking for long for a book called 'Samprad?ya Kalpadruma' by
Vitthalan?tha
or manara?jana kavi.
It is apparently a  Pushtimargiya Vaishnava Sampradaya text, which has been
extensively referred to by R B Athawale in his writings on Jagannatha
Pandita,  but all my searches for this book have served futile.
Can anyone guide me to a soft/hard copy of the said text, as also comment
on its relevance in the Pushtimarga tradition?
Kind regards
Santosh
