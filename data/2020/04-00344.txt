I am trying to write words like dy?tam in n?gar? in MS Word (using Keyman) but I end up without the ligature: it seems that whenever d is followed by consonant+u/?/?, the d ends up followed by vir?ma. This affects things like dy?, ddh?, etc. I will type the n?gar? here, but your systems may well correct it:

???????, -?????-, -??????-

When followed by -a-, the ligatures dy, db, ddh, etc come out correctly, but they split (into d-vir?ma-y etc) as soon as another vowel follows.

Even if I copy and paste the correct ligature from e.g. the Cologne dictionary, it splits when pasted.

Can anyone recommend a solution to this problem? My font selection seems to default to Nirmala or Kokila when writing in n?gar?, but perhaps there is a better Unicode font out there that has a wider range of ligatures?

I prefer not to use Word, but in this case there is no choice...

Thanks for any suggestions,
John
