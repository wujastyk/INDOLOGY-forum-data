The ??????? package by Robert Alessi joined the TeXLive distribution this
week.  ekdosis is a LuaLaTeX package designed for producing multilingual
critical editions.  I haven't tried it, but it seems promising to me, both
for its clear input syntax and its TEI output possibilities.  I am
emotionally attached to EDMAC, of course.  But this deserves a look:
