Dominik, this doesn't really answer your question, but in Thai (which 
admittedly does often spell Sanskrit words in non-standard ways, 
especially in pre-modern texts) the spelling ??? (ko?a), is quite 
common, perhaps even preferred, especially in the title ????????? 
(ko??dhipati), which was the official in change of the Phra Khlang, or 
treasury, in Ayutthaya.
