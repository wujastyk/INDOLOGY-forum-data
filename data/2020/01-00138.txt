Dear Matthew,
I was referring to most of the elements of the list I quoted, of course, not to the entire Vajras?c?. But you are right, Matthew: the Mah?bh?rata plays an important role in the Vajras?c?, as does? Manu ? which may be the reason for Patrick?s query. It is well known that the Vajras?c? attributes several verses to Manu that cannot be traced in the extant M?navadharma??stra (if I remember well, this is the reason why some scholars tentatively attributed them to a lost M?nava Dharmas?tra). Whatever the case may be, we might perhaps agree that the Vajras?c? is unlikely to have been composed before the 3rd-4th century CE. I am inclined to believe that it is even younger.
Very best,
Vincent

Betreff: Re: Vajras?c?

Not wishing to differ with my learned colleague Vincent Eltschinger's remarks (which are surely based on a deeper engagement with this corpus than my own), I tend nevertheless to think it not quite plausible that "most of its individual elements could have been known around 100 CE."
My sense is that the several epic and puranic parallels point to a somewhat later period.

Matthew

Subject: AW: Vajras?c?


Dear Patrick,

As you know, A?vagho?a directed some arguments against the Brahmanical understanding of the caste-classes in one of his dramas, the ??riputraprakara?a/?aradvat?putraprakara?a, several fragments of which have been preserved in Central Asian manuscripts and edited by Heinrich L?ders around 1910. It is thus plausible that A?vagho?a dedicated an individual treatise to this topic. The style, the method and the philosophical ressources of the Vajras?c?, however, are very different from the ones we know from A?vagho?a?s genuine works, and may presuppose Buddhist works such as the ??rd?lakar??vad?na if not Kum?ral?ta?s Kalpan?ma??itik? D????ntapa?kti?. Even if I am not aware of any convincing argument against the attribution of the Vajras?c? to A?vagho?a, I have always regarded the following statement as anachronistic: d??yante ca kvacic ch?dr? api vedavy?kara?am?m??s?s??khyavai?e?ikanagn?*j?vik?disarva??str?rthavida? /. ?And one observes in some cases that even ??dras know the meaning of all ??stras such as the Veda, Grammar, M?m??s?, S??khya, Vai?e?ika as well as [those of] the Jainas and the ?j?vikas.? (*-nagn?- em. : lagn?- Ed.) Although such a list is not per se impossible in A?vagho?a?s time, i.e., although most of its individual elements could have been known around 100 CE, I do not believe that such an enumeration would have been possible, as a doxographic statement, at that time, and even less so under A?vagho?a's "pen." (The absence of the Ny?ya from the list is intriguing.)

Another element possibly deserving some consideration is the Sanskrit colophon in which A?vagho?a is characterized as siddh?c?rya (k?tir iya? siddh?c?ry??vagho?ap?d?n?m iti), an expression the exact meaning of which remains somewhat unclear to me.

I am looking forward to reading other opinions on this interesting topic.

Very best,

Vincent

Betreff: Re: [INDOLOGY] Vajras?c?

Dear Patrick,

You'll find some discussion of it, inter alia, in Vincent Eltschinger, "Caste" et Philosophie Bouddhique WSTB 47 (2000). As you no doubt know, the Chinese translation is late - 10th c. if I recall correctly - and is attributed to DharmakIrti. I rather doubt that the true authorship can be established, given the available evidence. The emphasis on pramANa seems to suggest that it was written during the second half of the first millennium, not much before. But the way in which pramANa is used there does not resonate closely with the Buddhist pramANa school. The precise milieu in which it was composed remains a puzzle (at least to me!).

all best,
Matthew

Does anyone know of newer work on the identity and date of the author of Vajras?c?, often ascribed to A?vagho?a? Any new ideas on its possible date? With thanks and best wishes,
