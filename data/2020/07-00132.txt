[INDOLOGY] Pronounciation and transliteration of Marathi
Dear Harry,
     Only the letters ?, ?, and ? have alternative pronunciations, dental
and alveolar.  These are not optional pronunciations, but they occur in
definite words and definite combinations, but these differences are not
marked in Marathi Devanagari writing, and you need to consult a native
speaker for which ones are pronounced where.  Even the native persons know
this difference intuitively, but are not taught analytically in Marathi
schools.  That makes it difficult for non-native speakers to figure this
out.
