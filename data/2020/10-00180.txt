=?utf-8?Q?Re:_[INDOLOGY]_root_skr=CC=A5=3F?=
Thanks, Madhav.
The padap??hakara evidently considered ask?ta to be anomalous from his synchronic perspective; and P??ini?s treatment too makes synchronic sense. Here as elsewhere we need to remember that the Sanskrit grammatical tradition was synchronic, whereas western approaches to Sanskrit, especially to Vedic, tend to be diachronic.
For historical-comparative linguists this difference, and the different conclusions regarding forms like ask?ta, pari?k?ta, should actually be quite instructive; they raise interesting questions about the development of the language after the ?Ur-?g Veda?. (George Cardona has had interesting things to say in this regard, in reference to metrical issues.)
I hope you are keeping well,
Hans

Hello Hans,
     The fact that R?gveda 10.127.3 has askr?ta but the Padap??ha has akr?ta, probably explains why P??ini did not include a root skr?, but only proposed a contextual insertion or augmentation with "s". Best,
Madhav

Addition: A Sanskrit example of s-mobile would be the coexistence of a root tan- and a root stan-, both meaning ?thunder?
Dear Madhav and All,
There is also pari-?k?ta-. Unfortunately, Mayrhofer could not find any convincing parallels outside Sanskrit. However, there is a general phenomenon in Indo-European, called s-mobile (the varying presence or absence of a root-initial s). The Wikipedia entry "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_s-mobile? has a useful summary, as well as some relevant references. (An alternative, but more speculative explanation would be that in structures like namask? the s was reinterpreted as a simplification of earlier ss (similar to asi ?you are? for expected as-si, not also the Vedic external sandhi for -s#st etc.) and that this led to the notion that there is an alternative root form sk?-.)
All the best,
Hans

Dear colleagues,
In R?gveda 10.127.3 there is a verb form askr?ta showing the trace of the root skr?.  The Padap??ha of ??kalya presents this form as akr?ta, indicating that the root skr? as an independent root is no longer recognized. What is going on? Can one presume that forms like sa?skaroti where P??ini prescribes the insertion of "s" are actually survivals of this earlier root skr?.  Please suggest references that I can look up.
