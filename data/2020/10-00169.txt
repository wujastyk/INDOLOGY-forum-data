Dear colleagues,

In R?gveda 10.127.3 there is a verb form *askr?ta* showing the trace of the
root *skr?*.  The Padap??ha of ??kalya presents this form as *akr?ta*,
indicating that the root *skr? *as an independent root is no longer
recognized. What is going on? Can one presume that forms like
*sa?skaroti* where
P??ini prescribes the insertion of "s" are actually survivals of this
earlier root *skr?*.  Please suggest references that I can look up.
