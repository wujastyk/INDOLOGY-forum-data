[INDOLOGY] locative of goal
For what it's worth, the construction is possibly more common in Middle
Indic (see Sukumar Sen's comments in his Historical Syntax, s. 94). I
recall seeing it fairly often, although the only examples that I can pull
up now are piyayama-m?lammi gacchant? (Tara?gal?l?) and ga? acc?sa???su
p?avatal?su (L?l?va?).
