Just for the record, there is some theorization of the topic of emotion in
Indian cultural history, but not nearly enough.

   - Bilimoria, P. and Wenta, A., eds. (2014) *Emotions in Indian
   Thought-systems*. New Delhi: Routledge.
   - Pollock, S. (2016) *A Rasa Reader: Classical Indian Aesthetics,
   Historical Sourcebooks in Classical Indian Thought*. New York: Columbia
   University Press.
   - Tuske, J. (2011) ?The Concept of Emotion in Classical Indian
   Philosophy,? in *The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy*. Stanford:
   Stanford University, pp. 1?30. Available at:
   http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2011/entries/concept-emotion-india/
   .

Tuske's conclusions are cogent and compelling, I think, but perhaps
challenging for people coming to this for the first time.
