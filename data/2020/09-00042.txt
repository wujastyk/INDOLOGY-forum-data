[INDOLOGY] Publication Announcement: Controversial Reasoning in Indian Philosophy
Dear all,
I am happy to announce the publication of?Controversial Reasoning in Indian Philosophy: Major Texts and Arguments on Arth?patti?(Bloomsbury Academic July 2020)
As editor, I was fortunate to work with a group of excellent scholars of Sanskrit and Indian philosophy who have contributed translations and essays to the volume: Nilanjan Das, Elisa Freschi, Alessandro Graheli, Andrew Ollett, Stephen Phillips, Mark Siderits, Anand Vaidya, and Kiyotaka Yoshimizu. Information about the volume can be found at the publisher?s website, and I include below the book blurb for your reference.
About the book:
Arth?patti?is a pervasive form of reasoning investigated by Indian philosophers in order to think about unseen causes and interpret ordinary and religious language. Its nature is a point of controversy among M?m??s?, Ny?ya, and Buddhist philosophers, yet, to date, it has received less attention than perception, inference, and testimony.
This collection presents a one-of-a-kind reference resource for understanding this form of reasoning studied in Indian philosophy. Assembling translations of central primary texts together with newly-commissioned essays on research topics, it features a significant introductory essay. Readable translations of Sanskrit works are accompanied by critical notes that introduce?arth?patti, offer historical context, and clarify the philosophical debates surrounding it.
Showing how?arth?patti?is used as a way to reason about the basic unseen causes driving language use, cause-and-effect relationships, as well as to interpret ambiguous or figurative texts, this book demonstrates the importance of this epistemic instrument in both contemporary Anglo-analytic and classical Indian epistemology, language, and logic.
