[INDOLOGY] A distraction from the Coronavirus
Oh, I love this with mask, Christian. Frankly speaking, I enjoy all of
them.
And I am amazed by the discussion these poems incited.
Well, this is a perennial problem: Is poetry is free from rules or not? Is
there room for any innovation? For bold breaking rules?
With best wishes to all,

I would not dare to compose the poems in Sanskrit. The only language I can
do that is Polish.
