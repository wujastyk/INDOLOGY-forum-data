[INDOLOGY] Access to NAK/NGMPP manuscripts
Dear Indology List,
I would like to inquire whether anyone has access to NAK/NGMPP manuscripts or can recommend a way to get them electronically, short of going to Nepal. I would be grateful for any help or advice in this matter. The specific manuscripts I am looking for are as follows:
Manthanabhairava Siddhakhanda NAK nos. 5-4877, 1-228, and 1-787/2
Manthanabhairava Yogakhanda NAK nos. 2-165, 1-1151, 2-118, 5-4654, 3-164, 2-298, and 2-291.
Kulakaulinimata NAK nos. 5/9 (87) (17) 982-1009, 217a, A178/4, 3-788-139, and E 4041.
I apologize for cross-posting.
With gratitude,
Anya
