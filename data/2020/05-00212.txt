There is also a useful discussion of both Tibetan xylographs and Colonial

which also cites Rocher and Rocher's *Making of Western Indology*, p. 74:
Formigatti, Camillo A. 2016. ?A Forgotten Chapter in South Asian Book
History? A Bird?s Eye View of Sanskrit Print Culture.? In *Tibetan
Printing: Comparison, Continuities, and Change*, edited by Hildegard
Diemberger, Franz-Karl Ehrhard, and Peter Kornicki, 72?134.
All the best,
