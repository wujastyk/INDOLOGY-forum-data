Dear scholars,

During the projects involving digitization of Sanskrit works, some of us
feel lack of competent manpower sometimes.

On the other hand, there may be people who have requisite typing or
proofreading skills and are not able to get in touch with potential
employers / hirers.

Therefore, Vishvas at sanskrit-programmer group has created a small google
form.

Two requests to members -

1. If you know any person interested in Sanskrit digitization works, ask
them to register. I request you to disseminate this information to such
skilled people in your circle.

2. If you / your contacts are looking for people to digitize something, you
may consider hiring interested people from  the list
