Dear Yoshimizu-san,
Thank you for that. That is an interesting passage in Jizang?s commentary. The four vedas are named and given short characterizations, then the same with the six fields of study (?ik??, vy?kara?a, etc.), and then the eight schools, the first of which is given as ???. ?Correcting? that to ??? is plausible ? even if two of the three characters have to be replaced ? since if one ignores the current mandarin pronunciation, and instead pays attention to Korean and Japanese pronunciations which more closely reflect Chinese pronunciation of the time, ??? would be something like mi-mang-sa. The transcription preserved on the canon, ??? jian wang po, doesn?t come close. 
It is worth noting that neither ??? nor ??? appear in any other text, again strongly suggesting that M?m??s? was virtually unknown in China, reinforced by the mutilation of the transcription (two of three characters mangled), indicating that the transmitters and copyists were unfamiliar with the name.
Jizang is said to have become a novice at the age of 7 or so, and it is said he had mastered the ?ata-??stra by age nineteen.The standard dates for Param?rtha are 499?569 CE, and for Jizang 549?623, which would mean Param?rtha died when Jizang was only 19 or 20. Nice coincidence.
Many thanks.
Dan
