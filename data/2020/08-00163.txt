Subject: [INDOLOGY] Online publication of BuddhaNexus
Message-ID: <CAOB6=r-uVH43LYWOYqmUXUH87gYQ9V=CMqnS52NE21cqDOQa9A@mail.gmail.com>

We are happy to announce the online publication of the BuddhaNexus database
at

https://buddhanexus.net/

BuddhaNexus, a collaborative project of the Khyentse Center, Universit?t
Hamburg, is a database devoted to the study of Buddhist texts and literary
corpora in P?li, Sanskrit, Tibetan, and Chinese?with particular emphasis on
evolution of scriptures, formation of canons, and intellectual networks?by
way of locating textual matches within various Buddhist literary corpora
and texts. The current version includes material in P?li, Tibetan, and
Chinese and Sanskrit.
The Sanskrit data has been taken from the GRETIL canon and can be accessed
directly under this link with some more detailed description of the
methodology: https://buddhanexus.net/skt/neutral
Our deep gratitude goes to the GRETIL project and all the people that have
contributed to it at this point!
 The global search function of the BuddhaNexus is able to search within all
the Sanskrit texts by applying a stemming algorithm on the search requests.
The stemmer is accessible as a separate toolhere:
https://buddhanexus.net/sanskrit-tools
In this way it is possible to find results that follow a different
application of Sandhi, different use of morphological forms or particles
and so on. The global search function of the BuddhaNexus is not able to
replace precise search tools such as GREP, but it offers an alternative
that follows a different approach. There are some limitations on the
precision of the stemming algorithm, so it might happen that a desired
result does not show up accordingly.

Several other features are being currently developed, including linking to
other databases and generating translingual matches. In the near future we
plan to publish Sanskrit<>Tibetan bilingual matches.

For questions and/or feedback, please contact us under
buddhanexus.info at gmail.com.

With regards,

BuddhaNexus Team
