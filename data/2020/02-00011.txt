Dear Christophe,
Thanks a lot for your replies. Sorry that I did not provide a link to the
1923 copy. What you say about the printer possibly copying from the title
page of the first volume published by the Soci?t? belge d'?tudes orientales
makes a lot of sense. I looked at Poussin's volume 1 of *L?Abhidharmako?a
de Vasubandhu*, and the bottom three lines match those in the 1923
*Da?abh?mikas?tra* copy. That would well explain how the typographical
error arose. Thanks
Best regards,
.
