Subject: [INDOLOGY] query about publication announcement on book on buddhism
Message-ID: <CAM+oyOdLSV4qKQBB8UJfJAaL0nj9gcyCfR6NJFunMQRYJFBoYA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All
I am finding it difficult to locate a publication announcement in Indology
list that appeared sometimes back.
It was about a new book on buddhism. author claimed that early buddhism was
not a revolutionary one, instead it was to represent real vedic spirit.
I would be grateful if any of members help me in knowing about this book.
