In his book *Radices Sanskritae*, published in 1827 from Berlin, Frederick
Rosen lists the root ???? as occurring in the first and the 10th
conjugations, and provides forms like ?????/?????? and ?????/????????.

I have used the form ????? in one of my verses, and I wanted to know from
other Vaiy?kara?as if there is any evidence for the root ???? in the first
conjugation.  Perhaps, G.B. Palsule's concordance of the various versions
of the Dh?tup??ha has some information. I couldn't find my copy of this
book. Rosen does not list the source of his information.
