[INDOLOGY] a puzzling codicological term
Dear friends,
This is not an Indological query, but because some of you have extensive experience in the area of codicology I thought you might be able to help.
I have come across a term or abbreviation - "msptis" - that seems not to be a typo, as a search shows that it was current in 18th c. publications, particularly in catalogues of theological and patristic works. It comes up too - and this is why I am interested - in the title of a scholarly note on a Tibetan manuscript published in 1722: "nova literaria de msptis codicibus in Tartaria repertis." ("Tartaria" in this case refers to Siberia, where the manuscript was found.) In any case, I have had no luck finding the meaning of "msptis" in the resources available to me, in print or online. (Perhaps it is related to Hebrew MSPT, "justice"?) Pointers would be much appreciated.
with thanks in advance,
Matthew
