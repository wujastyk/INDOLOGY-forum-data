Dear Jonathan,
The use of vi.sa for positive purposes is rare in Indian medicine (no trace
as far as I know of the basic principle of homeopathy: similia similibus
curantur).
Nevertheless, it is also an ingredient in one of the recipes of
an Indrarasaayana according to Caraka.
And a Rgvedic, longhaired muni apparently used  some kind of vi.sa to
"fly"...
As for the production of vi.sa, it will depend whether it is plant based or
mineral based.
For "faults" in mercury which give it a  vi.sa character according to
Rasa;saastra see Oliver Hellwig's W?rterbuch der Mittelalterlichen
indischen Alchemie and my review of it in IIJ a few years back.
See also Meulenbeld's 5-volume History of Indian Medical Literature through
the index of Sanskrit and Tibetan words in volume III.
Best,
Jan
