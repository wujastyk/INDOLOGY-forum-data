[INDOLOGY] Texts about translators and translation?
Dear Colleagues,
Happy New Year!
A student of mine wants to study Sanskrit texts about translation and
translators. She also asked me if I knew any short poems or jokes ? again,
in Sanskrit ? about translators. Could you please kindly suggest anything?
Frankly, I know nothing about this topic ? have never encountered such
texts!
Many thanks and best wishes,
Nataliya
