Supporting Madhav's point is the famous passage early on in the
BhagavadG?t? where Arjuna describes how he feels almost entirely in
relation to his physical reactions (including the romahar?a- already
mentioned):

??????? ?? ???????? ???? ? ?????????? ?
???????? ????? ?? ?????????? ????? ??-???

???????? ??????? ??????????????? ????????? ?
? ? ???????????????? ??????? ? ?? ??? ??-???
