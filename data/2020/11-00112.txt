On second look, a?va (not asv?), would be a male horse, so kharastriy?m a?v?j j?t? va?av? would mean born from a female donkey and (male) horse, though I?m not sure what to make of va?av?/va?aba ?a male horse resembling a mare (and therefore attracting the stallion)? (MW).
So that is an attempt to treat a?vatar? as a hinny. But is that followed consistently in the literature?
