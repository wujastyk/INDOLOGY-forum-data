Dear Michael,
There are various bits of Sanskrit throughout Galactica - at the end of the
mini-series, Elosha chants the 'asato m? sadgamaya' (helpfully subtitled as
'priestess chanting in foreign language':-)); the surname of Roslin's aid
Billy is Keikeya (close enough to Kaikeya to make me think:-)); Roslin's
medicine is kamala extract - and so on.
I've long been wondering how this made it into the series - so far to no
avail. Ron Moore, the creator of this Galactica remake, was a Cornellian,
and Cornell has long had a fairly solid Sanskrit tradition - but beyond
that I have no idea. If anyone on the List can contribute to this, I'd be
most grateful!
(And for what it's worth, I hear the intro as sva?, over two notes, rather
than sv?h?.)
All the best,
     Antonia (outside the US, hence syfy's generosity does not reach me:-(!)
