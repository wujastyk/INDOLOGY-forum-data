[INDOLOGY] query about publication announcement on book on buddhism
 Dear Prof. Pandurangi,
Sorry that this is not the book you were looking for. Hopefully someone
here will recall it.
In the meantime, I can mention a few older books related to this topic.
*The Buddha-Mimansa: or, The Buddha and His Relation to the Religion of the
Vedas*, by Yogiraja's Disciple Maitreya, 2nd ed., London: Thacker, 1925;
several reprints.
*The Doctrine of the Upani?ads and The Early Buddhism*, *Die Lehre der
Upanishaden und die Anf?nge des Buddhismus*, by Hermann Oldenberg,
translated into English by Shridhar B. Shrotri, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass,
1991 (German original, 1908).
*Upanisads and Early Buddhism*, by Sanjay Govind Deodikar, Delhi: Eastern
Book Linkers, 1992.
Best regards,
David Reigle
