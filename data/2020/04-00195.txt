[INDOLOGY] CORRECTION: Help needed translating tantric verse
Hello Harry
I'm just catching up with this thread.
Do you think the verse may be echoing the idea from the Vibh?ti-p?da of Pata?jali's Yogasutras 3.32, k?rma-n??y?? sthairyam, i.e., (from performing sa?yama) on the tortoise channel (one's mind/psyche attains) stability (since one has withdrawn one's attention from external stimuli during meditation while awake).
Cheers
James
