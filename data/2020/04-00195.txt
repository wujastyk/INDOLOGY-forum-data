Hello Harry

I'm just catching up with this thread.
Do you think the verse may be echoing the idea from the Vibh?ti-p?da of Pata?jali's Yogasutras 3.32, k?rma-n??y?? sthairyam, i.e., (from performing sa?yama) on the tortoise channel (one's mind/psyche attains) stability (since one has withdrawn one's attention from external stimuli during meditation while awake).

Cheers
James

I don?t know of any clear references to this idea in texts, but one often sees Ku??alin? supported by a tortoise in ?cakra scrolls? from the 17th century onwards. See the attached image for an example.
