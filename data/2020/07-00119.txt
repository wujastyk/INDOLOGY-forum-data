Dear All,

Birgit Kellner, Madhav Deshpande, Harunaga Isaacson, and Jef Pierce all came through, sharing either a copy of Wezler's article or other related materials (of which I was not aware).

I am, as ever--and as all of us are I am sure--grateful for the Indology list and for this sort of support and collegiality.  Thank you.

Sincerely,
John

Dear Indologists,


I have tried to secure access to the following article with no luck from the usual resources.  Might anyone have a copy of the following that they would be willing to share with me?  I would be most grateful.

Sincerely,
