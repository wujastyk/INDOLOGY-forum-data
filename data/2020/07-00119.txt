Dear All,
Birgit Kellner, Madhav Deshpande, Harunaga Isaacson, and Jef Pierce all came through, sharing either a copy of Wezler's article or other related materials (of which I was not aware).
I am, as ever--and as all of us are I am sure--grateful for the Indology list and for this sort of support and collegiality.  Thank you.
Sincerely,
John
