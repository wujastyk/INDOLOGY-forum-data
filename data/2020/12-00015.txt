[INDOLOGY] Appropriate meaning of the word"Vigyan"
Dear Alakendu Das,
First, may I suggest that you use the International Alphabet of Sanskrit
Transliteration for writing Sanskrit words? This is what Indologists are
accustomed to. Thus, your vigyan would be written as vij??na.
As you noted in your query of Nov. 13, the meaning of vij??na in Buddhist
texts somewhat differs from its meaning in Hindu texts. In both cases, the
meaning of vij??na comes out in juxtaposition with j??na. An article on
this by Franklin Edgerton was published in 1933, "J??na  and vij??na,"
drawing on Hindu texts. I have scanned my photocopy of it and attached a
PDF of the scan.
Best regards,
