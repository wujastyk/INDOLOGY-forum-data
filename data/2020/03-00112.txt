Sort of related, on page 100 of chapter 5, of Amazing Stories (1943) issue

She put her hands on her hips, her
face thoughtful. Then she grabbed hold
of the grab-rail on the side of the door-

She wasn?t a tall girl, but she had to

pointed into the distance.
?Godwa te lele!?
?It?s all Sanskrit to me, Jamie,? he
said sadly. ?They?ve sure done you up
brown, haven?t they ? ^you?ve forgotten

good as any, and maybe we?ll solve a
few mysteries while we?re at it. We
might even find out how to get your
memory back again.?
She smiled dazzlingly. She pointed
again.
