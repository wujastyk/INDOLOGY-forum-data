[INDOLOGY] Overseas students and online teaching (US)
There is also the question of how this affects universities like The
University of the People <https://www.uopeople.edu/> that are ground-up
online.
I know nothing about the UoP beyond their website and a quite plausible
talk on the BBC by one of their heads; it sounds a bit like the UK's Open
University, but restricted to business and computing.  I've been finding
some of the UoP material on how they teach online quite helpful, as I have
to learn these online techniques for next semester.  NB: "Students learn in
small online classes of approximately 25 students to make sure professors
can focus on each student?s needs."  Hah! Tell that to our administrators.
Our Dean just said that small class teaching was bad because, "it denied
the students the experience of being part of a substantial cohort."  Pah
