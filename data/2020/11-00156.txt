Thank you for this additional information. My own initial search for hinnies yielded similar impressions, which is why I was surprised to see hinnies explicitly mentioned in the 4th c. Chinese translation of the sutta. As we suspected, the terminology was fluid, not fixed.
best wishes,
Dan

Also conceptually, the hinny is entirely missing. For Rau, ?the mule [(a?vatara/??) ...] is the offspring of a donkey and a mare? (p. 994 in his Kl. Schr.).

As to a?vatara, Turner writes that it is of pre-Indo-Aryan origin. It would be supported directly by Persian astra and indirectly by Khotanese kha?ara "mule", from hypothetical khara-tara (with reference to H.W. Bailey, BSOA 10, 590).
