As I recall, too, there is a translation or paraphrase of the Ny?yaprave?a attr. Dign?ga that is found in the Manimekhalai.

 In the 11th century, a scholar named ?r?dhara selected passages from Var?hamihira?s Laghuj?takam, his B?hajj?takam, and Kaly??avarman?s S?r?vali and translated them into new Kannada to create a text titled the J?takatilaka?. I suppose the question here is less what constitutes ?translation? and more what constitutes a ?text.? There are a number of other authors from the period who translate long passages from Sanskrit sciences, especially the works of Var?hamihira, into Kannada.



Elaine Fisher at Stanford is working on a project right now on 16th and 17th-century translations within the V?ra?aiva community. I am unsure if she has published the materials yet, but she has many.


All the best,

Eric

There is also a Marathi Abhanga rendering of the Bhagavadg?t? attributed to Tuk?r?m.  The 13th Century J??ne?var? is more of a Marathi verse commentary on the Bhagavadg?t? rather than a translation.  The 19th century is the real beginning of Marathi translations of Sanskrit and English works on a large scale.  This coincides with the emergence of printing and publishing.

Dear Patrick,

Marathi renderings of Bhart?hari?s three ?atakas and Jagann?tha's Ga?g?lahar? are attributed to the seventeenth-century poet V?mana Pa??it. There?s some debate among scholars of Marathi literature as to whether there were two V?manas, but either way, those texts were adapted into Marathi in the seventeenth century. The question of what constitutes a translation is worth asking in this case, as these 'translations? are refracted through V?mana?s unique understanding of bhakti and Advaita Ved?nta.

Best wishes,
