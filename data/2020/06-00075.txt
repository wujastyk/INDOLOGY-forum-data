Does anyone have a PDF of this article already sitting on their disk?

   - Kaul M. S. Shastri, "Report on the Gilgit Excavation in 1938",  *Quarterly
   Journal of the Mythic Society*, 30.1 (1939): pp.1-12.

I'd be grateful for a copy, if so.

There are numerous issues of the Quarterly at archive.org, but as far as I
can see, not this issue.  The Society's website sells issues, but I'm
loathe to buy one for twelve pages.  Also, it would probably take forever
to arrive.

Many thanks in advance.

Dominik
