[INDOLOGY] Navagraha worship in Tamil literature
Dear Ofer,
The sthala puranam of the temple of Tirunallaru associated with the worship
of Sani comes to mind. It is one of the 9 Navagraha Sthalas in Tamil Nadu.
That temple is also associated with the story of Nala. There is a
composition in praise of Siva (Darbaranyesvarar) called the *paccai
padigam. *
Although not pre-modern, Muttusvami Dikshitar composed a cycle of kritis on
the worship of the Navagrahas.
