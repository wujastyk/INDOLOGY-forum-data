[INDOLOGY] sources for the idea that reincarnation is a semi-random process?
Dear Dean,
another aspect may be helpful:
because I am doing some research on the concept of karman and hell, I 
see that already in the Gilgit-manuscripts (?yu?paryantas?tra)? a 
systematically composed description (Sanskrit-?loka) connects specific 
actions (karman) with the rebirth in certain hells.
When someone kills his mother his rebirth takes place in hell 1. If he 
is a robber in hell 8 etc.
This description is adapted in several later works and found also his 
way, probably via Burmese monks, in the later Pali-literature and is 
still observed in Thailand, Sri Lanka etc.
I did not translate the complete ?yu?paryantas?tra. If you can read 
Sanskrit (there is also a Tibetan translation) you may find the answer 
of your question beyond the rebirth in a hell.
Best
Heiner
