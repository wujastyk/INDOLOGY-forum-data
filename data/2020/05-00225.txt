Subject: [INDOLOGY] Orientation of text in sanskrit printed book

In the early history of printing in India, especially Bombay, lithograph
printing was commonly done this way, with the text in landscape format.
This was a direct transfer of the look-and-feel of the tradition manuscript
over to the new technology of reproduction.

There's a substantial collection (nearly 200?) of early Indian lithographs
in the Wellcome Library in London.  I don't quickly know how to sub-select
them in the OPAC, but here is a link to some of them.

The Wellcome Sanskrit and Hindi lithographs were catalogued long ago by
Somdev Vasudev.
