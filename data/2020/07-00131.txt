Subject: [INDOLOGY] Pronounciation and transliteration of Marathi
Message-ID: <CAJ3b0o9T4htqm7oJAYUW13A3f7jQHd49UY+wzgQugBBoS5ig8Q@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list members,
I need to provide a transliteration scheme to transliterate marathi hymns
for english speakers to chant.  What I need is a list of those Marathi
devanagari letters that have two pronounciations and what those
pronounciations are.  For example in Marathi ? is pronounced in some
contexts as ja and in others as za . I need to know the pronounciations for
the other Marathi letters with two pronounciations.

Also I have contradictory information about which letters have two
pronounciations.  One source says its ? ? ? ? , another source (the wiki
page on Marathi phonology https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathi_phonology)
says its:  ?  ? ? ?

Thanks,
Harry Spier
