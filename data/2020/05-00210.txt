P.S. Tibetan communities had been block printing this type of 'book' for
quite some time before lithography arrived in South Asia; xylography began
to flourish in Tibet in the 15th century (see Michela Clemente, "From
Manuscript to Block Printing: In the Search of Stylistic Models for the
Identification of Tibetan Xylographs," Rivista degli studi orientali Nuova
Serie 84 no. 1/4 (2011), 51-66.)
