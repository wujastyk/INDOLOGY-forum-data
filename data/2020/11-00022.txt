Dear Andrew,and through you to Yigal,
Thank you for this information, but I have a question/concern. Given the
*extremely* short deadline, and the fact that the successful candidate is
expected to start almost immediately thereafter, does not the Hebrew
University think it would only be fair to state clearly and honestly
whether in fact they already have an internal candidate for this position?
In fact I think this should be a moral imperative of every job search, but
that is besides the point: while putting together an application might be
possible so quickly, in a case like this, it is hard to imagine that a
person to whom this announcement comes out of blue would be able to pick up
and move (during Covid!) on such short notice, and therefore the
probability leaps immediately to mind that this is not an entirely open
advertisement.
Please advise.
Cordially,
Jonathan Silk
