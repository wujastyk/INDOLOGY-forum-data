Dear Colleagues,


Allow me to share with you a brief obituary (attached) announcing the passing of Rosalind J. Lefeber. Dr. Lefeber received her PhD from the University of Toronto, where for a while she also taught Sanskrit. She is possibly best known to us for her contribution to the UC Berkeley R?m?ya?a Translation Project and her translation The R?m?ya?a of V?lmik?. R?m?ya?a V?lm?k?ya?. An Epic of Ancient India. Volume IV: Ki?kindh?k???a, introduction, translation, and annotation by Rosalind Lefeber. Princeton Library of Asian Translations. Princeton: 1994 (see also the Clay Sanskrit Library edition).


In sadness and with warm regards,
Christoph
