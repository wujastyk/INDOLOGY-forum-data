A little distraction from Corona -

??????????????????? ??????: ??????????????? ?
????????????????????????????? ????????? ??? ??

Scared of the touch of Corona, the great grammarian Panini, at the very end
of his grammar, uttered the "untouched" sounds "a a" [? ?].

Note: According to phoneticians, the pronunciation of the vowel "a" [?] has
a completely clear vocal track with no contact of oral organs.
