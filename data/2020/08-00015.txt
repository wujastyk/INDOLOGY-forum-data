Dear Indology Members,
     I am forwarding this email from Professor Radhavallabh Tripathi about
a Twitter campaign of vilification against Professor Balram Shukla of Delhi
University.  If you have any further questions regarding this matter,
please contact Professor Tripathi [radhavallabh2002 at gmail.com].  With best
regards,
