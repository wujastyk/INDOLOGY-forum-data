> ?Last week, a group of Twitter users, including the anonymous Twitter

> Dr. Balram Shukla. Dr. Balram Shukla is a distinguished scholar in the
> world of Indological studies. With perfect command over Sanskrit, Prakrit,
> Urdu, Persian, and other languages, he has made remarkable contributions to
> the studies of literatures and cultures of these languages, broadening the
> horizons of comparative literature and culture. With fictitious citations
> and views incorrectly attributed to him, some members of the aforesaid

> life in this country and beyond would like to condemn the attack on the
> integrity and intent of Dr. Balram Shukla?s scholarship. We speak both as
> inheritors and interpreters of the great culture of plurality, debate, and
> democracy cherished in Indian intellectual traditions. We are equally
