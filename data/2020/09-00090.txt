[INDOLOGY] fate of demons slain by R?ma?Dear friends,
It is often said that the demons killed by R?ma 
are in fact liberated or dispatched to favorable rebirths, which of course provides a needed ethical fig-leaf with which to gloss the violence done to them.
The notion that the demon is in fact freed by R?ma is, so far as I am aware, explicit in some cases (e.g. the story of Vir?dha), but not in every case.When and where does it become a universal principle applied to all those killed? And are there any studies that you can recommend that focus on this particular theme? (which is perhaps more systematic in Kampan than in V?lmiki??)
Thanks in advance for any references you may be able to provide to scholarship on this subject.
Matthew
