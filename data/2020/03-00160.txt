[INDOLOGY] The study of Sanskrit as the epitome of uselessness
When in the 1980s I bought, second hand, Lanman's A Sanskrit Reader,  
the previous owner wrote this in clear writing on p. xv below Lanman's  
Introductory Suggestions:
Quit now before it's too late!
Scanned and attached the first paragraph.
I didn't follow the advice to quit.
