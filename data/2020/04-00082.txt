There is, of course Roger Zelazny?s 1967 Scifi novel, Lord of Light and, perhaps tangentially, there is the 2016 sci-fi film ?Arrival?in which  the actress Amy Adams plays an expert linguist and translator, Louise, who, because of her earlier assistance to the military with a translation from Farsi, is recruited by an army colonel to decipher the language of some extra-terrestrial visitors. When asked about other experts who might help, she says of a colleague at Berkeley, ?Ask him the Sanskrit word for ?war,? and its translation.? When the colonel reappears, he says the other linguist said ?gavisti? means ?an argument,? whereas Louise translates the same word as ?a desire for more cows.?
Bes to all. Be safe Stay well.
