[INDOLOGY] [RISA-L LIST] sources on markers of girls' transition to adulthood
husbands until after menarche
As far as my recollection goes - I am not in a position to cite sources as
I have no access to the relevant files at the moment -, the consummation of
marriage could also take place on the occasion of a so-called 'second'
marriage (*punar-viv?ha*) after the ritual wedding of a prepubescent girl.
Immediately after she had reached a childbearing age (i.e. after her first
menstruation), the girl was brought from her parents' house to her
husband's house. This practice corresponds more or less to the *garbh?dh?na
sa?sk?ra *(the rite of "impregnation") and had the sole purpose of making
the optimum use of her fertility.
Best wishes,
WS
