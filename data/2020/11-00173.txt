Re: [INDOLOGY] Anniversary of INDOLOGY
I've had my champagne :-)&nbsp;&nbsp; A very nice, dry Italian prosecco.
Reflecting on INDOLOGY, one remarkable feature of the list is that it's still using pretty old-fashioned software.&nbsp; The forum started with ?ric Thomas's LISTSERV, released in 1986 and run for us by Liverpool University.&nbsp; But we now use Mailman, which was written by John Viega and others and released in 1999, and currently maintained by Abhilash Raj.&nbsp; As we all know, it's just email bouncing about.&nbsp; There are more sophisticated systems available: bulletin boards, Google groups, etc.&nbsp; But last time we asked the INDOLOGY membership if they would like one of these new systems, there was an overwhelming opinion against change.&nbsp; And for me, part of the charm of INDOLOGY is this unfussy, low-tech aspect.&nbsp; It leaves us free to think about Indology.
Best,Dominik
