Hartmut Scharfe in his "The State in Indian Tradition" (Leiden: Brill, 
1989, p. 69) refers to K?tyakalpataru and V?ramitrodaya. In this list we 
find: deluge, drought, rats, locusts, parrots and kings that are too 
near [to their subjects] (and thus able to satisfy their greed). He 
refers, too, to an older list of calamities in the Artha??stra.
