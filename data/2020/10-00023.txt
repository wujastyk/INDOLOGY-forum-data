I have occasionally wondered whether the rendering in Vedic recitation of
anusv?ra with an additional syllable *gu? *is a mnemonic device to
discourage a weak pronunciation or elision entirely of the anusv?ra. In
fact I even wonder whether the standard modern rendering of anusv?ra with
an echo vowel serves the same purpose. Neither of these renditions of
anusv?ra seem to be phonetically motivated; the normal development of final
sibilants would I think be > spirantization > elision (as in Prakrit,
etc.).
I would be interested in hearing the experts' opinion on this.
