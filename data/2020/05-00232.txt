Dear scholars,
Digital version of the following work is now available.
Ga?itan?mam?l? of Haradatta

https://github.com/sanskrit-kosha/kosha/blob/master/ganitanamamala_haradatta/orig/ganitanamamala.txt

N.B. - The printed version has a lot of grammatical errors apparent on face
of it. Therefore, the confidence level for editing digitized version is
also quite low.
