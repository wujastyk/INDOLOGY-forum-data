In other words, ???????? is a bahuvr?hi ? ?????? ???? ???: ?? ????????:
So the BR gloss catches the spirit, even if not the exact grammatical construction.

Dear Harry,
    Compare Bhartr?hari's verse:
????????????????????????
???? ?????? ???????????? ? ?
???? ????????? ?????? ????????????
???? ???????? ?????????? ???????? ??
The verse suggests that a dog is willing to go through his ??????? in order to get his food, while the proud elephant is not.  In the verse ?????? ?????????? ??? ???????: ???????:, the term ??????? is used.  The expression ????????? ??????? in my view refers to the kind of life where one's pride is not broken by the circumstances, and that one can only preserve one's pride ????? only with  qualities like ???????-??????-????.

Dear list members,
Like many on this list I'm now at home and passing the time by reading sanskrit. I'm going through the Panchatantra.
Verse 1.34 is:
yaj j?vyate k?a?am api prathita? manu?yair vij??navikramaya?obhir abhagnam?nam tan n?ma j?vitam iha pravadanti tajj??? k?ko 'pi j?vati cira? ca bali? ca bhu?kte |
which Patrick Olivelle translates as:
"If his repute is spread wide among men, if he lacks not wisdom, courage, or fame, 'That's true life in this world." the wise say: even crows live long, but they live on scraps."
and Edgerton translates as:
Real life in this world, the wise say, is only that which is lived, perchance only for a brief season, yet known to fame among men, and not lacking in wisdom, prowess, or glory. A very crow lives a long time and devours the food that is thrown to it.
I'm not clear what abhagnam?nam means in the verse and how it fits into these translations.
Bohtlingk-Roth for  abhagnam?nam has Adj. wobei die Ehre nicht leidet  which I think means something like "whereby honor doesn't suffer" which even more confuses me.
Any help would be appreciated.
