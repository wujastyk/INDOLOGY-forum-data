Dear Jan,
     Narayan Prasad on BVP also pointed to Bopadeva's Kavikalpadruma for
?????/??????.  The verb form ????? may as well be a borrow-back from
vernacular usages.  For now, Bopadeva is a good authority for me to use
?????/????? in my verses. The past perfect corresponding to ?????? is the
periphrastic ???????? type, rather than ?????.  With best wishes,
Madhav
