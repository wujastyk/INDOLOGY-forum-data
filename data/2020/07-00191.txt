Dear Antonia,
For a quick overview of changes in stem classes in the Vedic period, I find
Martin K?mmel's "Liste vedischer Verbst?mme und -Formen" to be extremely
useful:
https://www.oriindufa.uni-jena.de/iskvomedia/indogermanistik/K?mmel_vved.pdf
It's based (in part) on the works already cited by Profs Korn and Parpola
(and other works, of course). Innovative present stem classes are easy to
find if you skim through and keep an eye out for arrows.
Also, there's a new dissertation on the nasal presents by Albert Zasada
(LMU Munich), which you can add to the list of monographs on Vedic verbal
morphology.
All the best,
Dieter
