Dear Jan,
here is an example of avai-y-a?akkam, taken from the V?rac??iyam, with 
the (unpublished) expanded English rendering by the late scholar T.S. 
Gangadharan

The Apology (Avai-y-a?akkam)
If I am questioned: "Can you speak on that Tamil grammar, the work 
wrought for the benefit of them that live in the world where abides his 
immortal fame, the work which is so cooling to the mind, the work of 
Akattiya? who is endowed with clarified intellect, the work of the ch?la 
(pupil) of Aval?ka? whose cultural attainment is hailed by many 
discerning scholars", I will answer thus: "The fly too wings the 
spacious sky expanse where flies the Brahminy kite! In this is the 
fitness of things? What does the world say? (Does the world approve of 
this?) If this can pass muster, so can my work also."
