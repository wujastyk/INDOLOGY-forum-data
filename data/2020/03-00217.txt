Dear Jan,

here is an example of avai-y-a?akkam, taken from the V?rac??iyam, with 
the (unpublished) expanded English rendering by the late scholar T.S. 
Gangadharan

_?yu? ku?attava l?kita? pakka lakattiya?k??
??yum puva?ik kiyampiya ta??ami ???kuraikka
n?yu mu?aiy? ve?i?karu ?a?ce??a n??vicumpil
_?yum pa?akku mita?ke? kol?collu m?nti?aiy?.


The Apology (Avai-y-a?akkam)

If I am questioned: "Can you speak on that Tamil grammar, the work 
wrought for the benefit of them that live in the world where abides his 
immortal fame, the work which is so cooling to the mind, the work of 
Akattiya? who is endowed with clarified intellect, the work of the ch?la 
(pupil) of Aval?ka? whose cultural attainment is hailed by many 
discerning scholars", I will answer thus: "The fly too wings the 
spacious sky expanse where flies the Brahminy kite! In this is the 
fitness of things? What does the world say? (Does the world approve of 
this?) If this can pass muster, so can my work also."
[reproduced VERBATIM, without trying to do further investigations]

Concerning Zvelebil's Tolk?ppiyam translation, it appeared in small 
sections in the JTS but he does not seem to have finished it.

Here is what is available (extracted from the bibliography in my Ph.D. 
thesis):

Studies, n? 1, p. 43-60 [chap. 1 ? 3]; n? 2, p. 13-29 [chap. 4 ? 6]; n? 
3, p. 17-27 [chap. 7]; n? 4, p. 13-23 [chap. 8]; n? 5, p. 34-36 [chap. 9
(14 sutras)]; n? 7, p. 62-66 [chap. 9 (42 sutras)]; n? 8, p. 8-11 [chap. 
9 (21 sutras)], Madras, International Institute of Tamil Studies 
[traduction en anglais du premier livre du tolk.].

Zvelebil Kamil, 1978-1985, ?Tolk?ppiyam Collatik?ram?, Journal of Tamil
Studies, n? 13, p. 79-86 [chap. 1 (30 sutras)]; n? 20, p. 5-14 [chap. 1
(31 sutras)]; n? 21, p. 9-19 [chap. 2]; n? 28, p. 67-80 [chap. 3], 
Madras, International Institute of Tamil Studies [traduction en anglais 
du second livre du Tolk. qui couvre pour l'instant les trois premiers 
chapitres]

Best wishes to you too
