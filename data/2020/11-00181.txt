This corresponds to Ganguli's translation::
?
?If, O Sanjaya, thou art about to be stained with infamy and I do not  
(from affection) tell thee anything, then that affection, worthless  
and unreasonable, would be like that of the she-ass?s for her young.?
?
ta? tv?m aya?as? sp???a? na br?y?? yadi sa?jaya
khar?v?tsalyam ?hus tan ni?s?marthyam ahetukam (MBh 5.133.6)
?
The reason for this interpretation is obvious: The standard dictionary  
meaning of /khara /is ?donkey? (/khar? /?she-donkey?), but why should  
the affection of a she-donkey towards her foal be ?inappropriate? and  
?groundless?? The PW (and other dictionaries), however, lists further  
meanings of /khara/, including ?mule? (?Maulthier?).
The fact that the female form /khar? /according to the same dictionary  
also should mean ?she-hinny? (?Mauleselin?) besides ?she-donkey? could  
be a further hint that the difference between mules and hinnies was  
not taken into account here.
By the way, B?htlingk's main source for the meaning "/khara/ = mule  
('Maulthier')" is Puru?ottamadeva's /Trik???a?e?a /2.8.44, where three  
words meaning "mule" (and/or "hinny"?) are listed (/ve?ara /[=  
/vesara/], /a?vatara/, and /khara/).
