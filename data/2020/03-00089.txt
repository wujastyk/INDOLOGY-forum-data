[INDOLOGY] request for article
Many thanks to Professors Jonathan Silk and Roland Steiner, who both shared the article with me within minutes! Roland Steiner also alerts me to the fact that the past volumes of the Journal of the European ?yurvedic Society (JE?S) have been uploaded to the Internet Archive: https://archive.org/details/ualberta_specialprojects?and%5B%5D=european+ayurvedic&sin= <https://archive.org/details/ualberta_specialprojects?and[]=european+ayurvedic&sin=>. 
I realized once more how extraordinarily interconnected our modern world is, with both its positive and negative consequences. 
Be safe!
