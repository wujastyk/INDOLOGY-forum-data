=?utf-8?Q?Re:_[INDOLOGY]_Thieme_on_=C4=AA=C5=9Bopani=E1=B9=A3ad?=
Dear Jeff,
     I have read through Patrick's Introduction to his book, but he does
not specifically discuss the order of Ch?ndogya and ??? Upani?ads that
Thieme discusses in the paragraph I cited.  I would have preliminarily
assumed that as part of the ?ukla Yajurveda Sa?hit?, the ??? Upani?ad might
be somewhat earlier.  Best,
