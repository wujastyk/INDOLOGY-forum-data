[INDOLOGY] A distraction from the Coronavirus
Where svaya?dh?r?? is the operative word.
All that we say as indologists would have been said in vain in the eyes of the ?ruti liberationists. What better time for liberating levity than this? Spectators can always close their eyes.

Re: [INDOLOGY] A distraction from the Coronavirus
Has not the ?ruti said:
avidy?y?m antare vartam?n??
svaya?dh?r?? pa??ita?manyam?n?? |
dandramyam???? pariyanti m??h?
andhenaiva n?yam?n? yath?ndh?? ||
As it appears from the cascade of poetic performances to which we are exposed here as spectators, it was - alas - uttered in vain.

Just for the indological record (without wanting to encourage or discourage anyone here):
1. padma is also used as a masculine (examples: r?ghava? cintayitvaivam upetya cara?au pitu? /
ha?sa? padm?v iva navau jagr?ha nakhakesarau; or: adya tv atitar?? brahman mama bh?gyaviparyay?t /
himenev?hata? padmas sampanno harita? k??a?). 2. The metre in the "original" stanza is a (correct) Upaj?ti. Now it is a (correct) Indravajr?.
