Dear Prof. Slaje,
Thank you for those examples. However, as far as I can tell, the idea that a?vatar? is a hinny, rather than a she-mule, seems to be only in Steiner?s interpretation, not in the texts themselves. Bh?skaraka??ha only explains it as a female mule (khara = mule, str? = female animal). Similarly, dvij?t?ya similarly just means a mule, without specifying that the parents must be a male horse and a female donkey rather than the inverse.
Monier-Williams has around 24 terms that can mean a mule, several of which mean a she-mule (e.g., a?vatar?, khar?, etc.), typically by giving a word for mule a feminine form. For instance:
a?vatara b m. (P??. 5-3, 91 ) a mule, AV. iv, 4, 8 ; ?Br.  &c. 	      
(compar. of a?va) a better horse, Pat.       
a male calf, L. 	      
one of the chiefs of the N?gas, MBh. ; Hariv.  &c.	      
N. of a Gandharva, L.  	      
a?vatar? f. a better mare, Pat.     
a?vatar? f. a she-mule, AV. viii, 8, 22 ; MBh. &c.
But a she-mule is not a hinny. A mule has a male donkey and a female horse for parents. A hinny has the opposite: a male horse and a female donkey for parents. Mules and hinnies are physiologically different from each other as well. A hinny can be a male or a female.

The wikipedia entry for ?mule? says the following about their fertility:
==
Mules and hinnies have 63 chromosomes <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome>, a mixture of the horse's 64 and the donkey's 62. The different structure and number usually prevents the chromosomes from pairing up properly and creating successful embryos, rendering most mules infertile <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertile>.
A few mare mules have produced offspring when mated with a purebred horse or donkey.[18] <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mule#cite_note-18>[19] <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mule#cite_note-Kay2002-19> Herodotus <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herodotus> gives an account of such an event as an ill omen of Xerxes' invasion of Greece <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Persian_invasion_of_Greece> in 480 BC: "There happened also a portent of another kind while he was still at Sardis?a mule brought forth young and gave birth to a mule" (Herodotus The Histories <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histories_(Herodotus)> 7:57), and a mule's giving birth was a frequently recorded portent in antiquity, although scientific writers also doubted whether the thing was really possible (see e.g. Aristotle <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle>, Historia animalium, 6.24; Varro <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varro>, De re rustica, 2.1.28).
As of October 2002, there had been only 60 documented cases of mules birthing foals since 1527.[19] <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mule#cite_note-Kay2002-19> In China <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China> in 2001, a mare mule produced a filly <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filly>.[20] <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mule#cite_note-FertileMule1985-20> In Morocco <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco> in early 2002 and Colorado <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado> in 2007, mare mules produced colts.[19] <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mule#cite_note-Kay2002-19>[21] <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mule#cite_note-Npr2007-07-26-21>[22] <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mule#cite_note-DenverPost2007-09-19-22> Blood and hair samples from the Colorado birth verified that the mother was indeed a mule and the foal was indeed her offspring.[22] <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mule#cite_note-DenverPost2007-09-19-22>
A 1939 article in the Journal of Heredity describes two offspring of a fertile mare mule named "Old Bec", which was owned at the time by Texas A&M University <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_A%26M_University> in the late 1920s. One of the foals was a female, sired by a jack. Unlike her mother, she was sterile. The other, sired by a five-gaited Saddlebred <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Saddlebred> stallion, exhibited no characteristics of any donkey. That horse, a stallion, was bred to several mares, which gave birth to live foals that showed no characteristics of the donkey.[23] <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mule#cite_note-JHeredity-30-12-23>

The wikipedia entry on ?hinny" has the following on fertility:
==
Hinnies are difficult to obtain because of the differences in the number of chromosomes <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome> of the horse and the donkey <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey>. A donkey has 62 chromosomes, whereas a horse has 64. Hinnies, being hybrids of those two species <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species>, have 63 chromosomes and are in the majority of cases sterile <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertile>. The uneven number of chromosomes results in an incomplete reproductive system <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_system>. According to the ADMS: "The equine hybrid is easier to obtain when the lower chromosome count, the donkey, is in the male. Therefore breeding for hinnies is more hit-and-miss than breeding for mules."[2] <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinny#cite_note-LongearLingo-2>
The male hinny or mule can and will mate, but the emission is not fertile <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility>. Male hinnies and mules <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mule> are usually castrated to help control their behavior by eliminating their interest in females.[citation needed <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed>]
Female hinnies and mules are not customarily spayed, and may or may not go through estrus <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrus>. Female mules have been known, on rare occasions, to produce offspring when mated to a horse or donkey, although this is extremely uncommon. Since 1527, sixty cases of foals born to female mules around the world have been documented.[4] <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinny#cite_note-Kay2002-4> In contrast, according to the ADMS, there is only one known case of a female hinny doing so.
Namely, in China <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China>, in 1981, a hinny mare proved fertile with a donkey sire. When the Chinese hinny was bred to a jack, she produced the so-called "Dragon Foal", which resembled a donkey with mule-like features.[5] <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinny#cite_note-FertileMule1985-5> In Morocco <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco>, in 2002, a mule mare bred to a donkey sire produced a male foal.[4] <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinny#cite_note-Kay2002-4> DNA testing revealed the foal has a mixed karyotype <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karyotype> hybrid like the Chinese hinny offspring "Dragon Foal".[citation needed <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed>]
Hinnies are rare for many other reasons. Donkey jennies and horse stallions can be choosier about their mates than horse mares and donkey jacks.[citation needed <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed>] Thus, the two parties involved may not even care to mate. Even if they do cooperate, donkey jennies are less likely to conceive when bred to a horse stallion than horse mares are when bred to a donkey jack. Breeding <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_breeding> large hinnies is an even bigger challenge, as it requires stock from a jenny of large size, such as the Baudet de Poitou <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baudet_de_Poitou> or American Mammoth Donkey <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Mammoth_Donkey>. Mammoth donkey stock is becoming increasingly rare and has been declared an endangered domestic breed. Fanciers are unlikely to devote a Mammoth jenny's valuable breeding time to producing sterile hinny hybrids, when Mammoth jennies are in high demand to produce fertile purebred Mammoth foals

There is no mention of requiring caesarians.
Some of the mule terms in MW:
dvi?j?t?ya mfn. relating to the twice-born i.e. to the first 3 castes of twofold nature or mixed origin, mongrel. dvi?j?t?ya m. a mule.
m?ka ?the offspring of a mule and mare?
ru??a m. the offspring of a mule and a mare (also means ?maimed, mutilated; a headless body?)
vega?sara m. (cf. vesara) a mule.  	      
vega?sar? f. a female mule.
vesara m. (cf. vega-sara; also written ve?ara) a mule.  	      
vesar? f. a female mule.
sak?d?garbha m. ?having only one conception?, a mule.
sa?-ka?r??va m. ?mongrel horse?, a mule.
While some refer to female mules, I don?t think any of these terms specifically indicate a hinny, which, again, could be male or female. The Chinese terms clearly differentiate between a mule (? luo, the result of mating a mare with a donkey) and a hinny (?? juxu, result of mating a stallion with a female donkey). I remain curious what the underlying Sanskrit or prakrit term behind juxu might be.
with regards,
Dan
