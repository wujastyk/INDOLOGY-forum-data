[INDOLOGY] a puzzling codicological term
Thanks to Dan Lusthaus and Christian Ferstl for their quick suggestions.
It seems likely to be "manuscriptis," dative plurel to agree with codicibus and thus referring to a handwritten, as opposed to a printed, volume/codex. This would fit the context at least.
best,
