[INDOLOGY] Anniversary of INDOLOGY
Dear Dominik,
Congratulations on your initiative in founding the list, which has been 
such a benefit to all of us.? I am pleased to have been a small part of 
it myself as a past management committee member.
Best wishes to you personally and for the continued success of the list
