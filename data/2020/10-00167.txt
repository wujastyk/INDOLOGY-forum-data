[INDOLOGY] Manusmriti ... (Olivelle, J P)
   Rajam,
  The ninth *adhy?ya* begins with injunctions meant for *puru?asya striy??
ca ... dharme vartmani ti??hato?* "the man and woman (or "husband and
wife") who stand in the path of the law," and from 9.1 up to 9.21 the
subject of the verbs in the plural third person seems to be the not better
specified *striya?* "women" in pada 9.1a. I hope this helps!
   *namaskaromi*,
   Diego
