Dear list members,

. . .according to the standards as reported in sources spanning some 1600 years
and very much still current today, it is absolutely necessary to adhere to
grammatically correct Sanskrit and the rules of meter  . . .

It also seems that earlier there wasn't so much a concern.
Of the 12 Gayatri mantras at  Maitr?ya??-Sa?hit?  2-9-1, three of those
gayatri mantras have extra syllables.

And see this post of Madhav's
http://list.indology.info/pipermail/indology_list.indology.info/2015-
January/040590.html  which concludes:  the Br?hma?a texts were not bothered
by deviations of meters up to two syllables".

Why the change in attitude towards meter?
