Dear followers of this thread,



although there may have been several A?vagho?as (as in the cases of
N?g?rjuna,

?ryadeva, Vasubandhu, etc.), including a Tantric *siddh?c?rya*, the one
previously

referred to as our point of departure in this context, is of course the one
dated to

the 1st?2nd century CE, who ?is widely acknowledged as one of the earliest
and

greatest representatives of Indian *k?vya* literature? (Eltschinger, JIP 41
[2013]: 167),

and who lived around the same time that has been estimated by Olivelle
(?probably

in the middle of the second century CE?, in *Hindu **Law*, 2018: 24) to be
likewise that

of the composition of the *M?navadharma??stra*.



For various reasons, I stumbled over *Vajras?c?*, verse 12, which in the
commentary

(2nd ed. Mukhopadhyaya, 1960: 3) is introduced as having actually been
uttered

(*ukta? hi m?nave dharme*) in this *M?navadharma??stra* (MDh):



          *?k??ag?mino vipr?? patanti m??sabhak?a??t |*

*          vipr???? patana? d???v? tato m??s?ni varjayet ||12||*



          Due to consuming meat, the space-walking seers do fall.

          Hence, observing the seers? fall one should abandon meats.



Although not being a direct quotation, the reference to MDh 5.48

is clear enough, especially in consideration of VS 12d and MDh 5.48d

(quoting Olivelle?s ed & tr in the following):



          *n?k?tv? pr??in?? hi?s?? m??sam utpadyate kvacit |*

*          na ca pr??ivadha? svargyas tasm?n m??sa? vivarjayet || 48 ||*



          One can never obtain meat without causing injury to living beings,

          and killing living beings is an impediment to heaven; he should,

          therefore, abstain from meat.



While this reference may be considered as providing sufficient philological

evidence for historically assuming VS to be later than MDh, the fact that
the

notion of an *?k??ag?min* corresponds to that of a *khecara* would at least
not

contradict the assumption that the author of the *Vajras?c?* may in fact
have

been associated with the social sphere of the *siddh?c?rya*s, being also the

sphere of Vajray?na.



Another twist of the story is provided by the respective arguments for

abstaining from consuming pieces of flesh from the corpses of brutally

slaughtered animals, given particularly in Mah?y?na, prior to the
antinomian

Vajray?na practice of ritually consuming flesh, the main Buddhist reason

for not harming any living beings has been compassion (cf., e.g., the
concise

outline in Schmithausen?s ?The Case of Vegetarianism ? A Buddhist

Perspective? [https://tinyurl.com/qqxhvrf]). ? Comparing the two verses
quoted

above, it is in MDh 5.48, where compassion is appealed to. The *Vajras?c?*,

contrary to what we might expect, is not doing so. How to historically
account

for this evidence? Could it be that, while likewise casting a side-glance
at his

space-walking colleagues, *siddh?c?rya *A?vagho?a?s intention has been to
also

include them in his critique of animal corpse consumers?



Best wishes,

Hartmut Buescher
