Dear followers of this thread,
although there may have been several A?vagho?as (as in the cases of
N?g?rjuna,
?ryadeva, Vasubandhu, etc.), including a Tantric *siddh?c?rya*, the one
previously
referred to as our point of departure in this context, is of course the one
dated to
the 1st?2nd century CE, who ?is widely acknowledged as one of the earliest
and
greatest representatives of Indian *k?vya* literature? (Eltschinger, JIP 41
[2013]: 167),
and who lived around the same time that has been estimated by Olivelle
(?probably
in the middle of the second century CE?, in *Hindu **Law*, 2018: 24) to be
likewise that
of the composition of the *M?navadharma??stra*.
For various reasons, I stumbled over *Vajras?c?*, verse 12, which in the
commentary
(2nd ed. Mukhopadhyaya, 1960: 3) is introduced as having actually been
uttered
(*ukta? hi m?nave dharme*) in this *M?navadharma??stra* (MDh):
          *?k??ag?mino vipr?? patanti m??sabhak?a??t |*
*          vipr???? patana? d???v? tato m??s?ni varjayet ||12||*
          Due to consuming meat, the space-walking seers do fall.
          Hence, observing the seers? fall one should abandon meats.
Although not being a direct quotation, the reference to MDh 5.48
is clear enough, especially in consideration of VS 12d and MDh 5.48d
(quoting Olivelle?s ed & tr in the following):
          *n?k?tv? pr??in?? hi?s?? m??sam utpadyate kvacit |*
*          na ca pr??ivadha? svargyas tasm?n m??sa? vivarjayet || 48 ||*
          One can never obtain meat without causing injury to living beings,
          and killing living beings is an impediment to heaven; he should,
          therefore, abstain from meat.
While this reference may be considered as providing sufficient philological
evidence for historically assuming VS to be later than MDh, the fact that
the
notion of an *?k??ag?min* corresponds to that of a *khecara* would at least
not
contradict the assumption that the author of the *Vajras?c?* may in fact
have
been associated with the social sphere of the *siddh?c?rya*s, being also the
sphere of Vajray?na.
Another twist of the story is provided by the respective arguments for
abstaining from consuming pieces of flesh from the corpses of brutally
slaughtered animals, given particularly in Mah?y?na, prior to the
antinomian
Vajray?na practice of ritually consuming flesh, the main Buddhist reason
for not harming any living beings has been compassion (cf., e.g., the
concise
outline in Schmithausen?s ?The Case of Vegetarianism ? A Buddhist
Perspective? [https://tinyurl.com/qqxhvrf]). ? Comparing the two verses
quoted
above, it is in MDh 5.48, where compassion is appealed to. The *Vajras?c?*,
contrary to what we might expect, is not doing so. How to historically
account
for this evidence? Could it be that, while likewise casting a side-glance
at his
space-walking colleagues, *siddh?c?rya *A?vagho?a?s intention has been to
also
include them in his critique of animal corpse consumers?
Best wishes,
Hartmut Buescher
