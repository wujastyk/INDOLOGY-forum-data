[INDOLOGY] C.W. (Sandy) Huntington
Dear Colleagues,
I don't think the sad news has been shared on this list of the passing of
C.W. (Sandy) Huntington, who was among other things a Sanskritist (a
student of our Madhav Deshpande, in fact) and an important scholar of
Madhyamaka Buddhism. One of Sandy's publishers, Wisdom Publications, has
put out this poignant remembrance of him, and the link to it is just below.
I thank Andy Rotman of Smith College for alerting me and others to this.
