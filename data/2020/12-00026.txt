[INDOLOGY] paleographic question
Dear Matthew,
I briefly discuss this topic in a 2016 article, which you can download from Brill's website:
Formigatti, Camillo A. " 6 A Forgotten Chapter in South Asian Book History? A Bird's Eye View of Sanskrit Print Culture". In Tibetan Printing: Comparisons, Continuities and Change, (Leiden, The Netherlands: Brill, 2016) doi: https://doi.org/10.1163/9789004316256_008
(You can find my thoughts about it on p. 84 and following. By the way, I have continued my research on the issue since then and I have a more informed opinion now, which I can share with you off list.)
Best wishes,
Camillo

[INDOLOGY] paleographic question
Dear friends,
When and where does one first see the development of the ornamental script known in Nepal as Ra?jana (Tib. Lantsha)? I'm assuming Pala-period Bihar/Bengal, but would be pleased to be corrected about this or to receive greater specification.
thanks in advance,
Matthew
