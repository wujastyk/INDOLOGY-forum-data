[INDOLOGY] Article request
Dear colleagues,
Would one of you have a copy of the following article, which I need: Gosta Johnsen, ?Varuna and Dhrtarastra,? in Indo-Iranian Journal vol. 9, 1965-66. I do not have the page numbers, just a citation to page 225 n. 47. Thanks in advance, and much appreciated.
