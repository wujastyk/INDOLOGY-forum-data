[INDOLOGY] K.R. Norman
Dear Colleagues,
I write with the sad news of the death of K.R. Norman, who died this morning at the age of 95.
Roy or Mr Norman, as he liked to be known, was one of the great scholars of Middle Indo-Aryan philology. His academic career was spent almost entirely in Cambridge. He completed an MA at Cambridge in 1954 and went on to become Lecturer in Indian Studies (1954?1978), then Reader in Indian Studies (1978?1990), before being appointed Professor of Indian Studies in 1990, shortly before his retirement in 1992.
His scholarly contribution to the field of Pali studies has been immense, but his output covered also Jaina studies and the Ashokan inscriptions. His publications include translations of the major verse texts of the Pali canon: Elders? Verses I (Theraga?tha?), 1969; Elders? Verses II (Theri?ga?tha?), 1971; The Group of Discourses (Suttanipa?ta), 1992, 2nd ed. 2001; The Word of the Doctrine (Dhammapada), 1997; each of these translations includes meticulous philological annotations.
