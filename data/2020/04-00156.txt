[INDOLOGY] Mayavada (was Lines to an Advaitin)
Probably, if somebody explicitly provides references to the sources of
given
quotations, everybody can understand these. Nobody denied ?a?kar?c?rya's
employment/interpretation of the term *m?y?* as such (to the contrary).
Mayeda?s old investigations of various works ascribed to ?a?kara being
well-known,
yet given that authorship studies often initiate, rather than conclude, the
given
issue, I?d rather be interested in learning about more recent studies
addressing
the authorship of the *Gau?ap?d?yabh??ya* particularly with a focus on how
significant technical terms were understood by respectively Gau?ap?da and
the author of this *B**h??ya*. That is, beyond Bouy?s unfortunately in some
respects
somewhat problematic Gau?ap?da monograph that has received an excellent
review
by J. Hanneder (Indo-Iranian Journal 46 [2003]: 161-165), who had to
conclude:
?To follow ?a?kara in sensitive interpretational details is philologically
and
historically inadmissible and B?s treatment of Gau?ap?da?s work is in this
respect
a step back to the outdated interpretation of Karmarkar?.
The mere differences of understanding technical terms and philosophical
intentions
between Gau?ap?da and the Bh??yak?ra would, however, not necessarily serve
to
reject ?a?kar?c?rya?s authorship of this *B**h??ya* (but then rather throw
some interesting
light on ?a?kara?s hermeneutical relationship to his, traditionally
speaking, Guru?s
Guru). Ironically somebody might even assert that twisting the meaning of
passages
in texts ?a?kara comments upon is actually part of his philosophical
trademark and,
e.g., refer to V. S. Ghate?s study of the BSBh, often taken as the
reference work for
evaluating the authorship of other works ascribed to ?a?kara.
Ghate (*The Ved?nta. A Study of the Brahma-s?tras with the Bh??yas of
?a?kara, *
*R?m?nuja, Nimb?rka, Madhva and Vallabha*, Poona, 3rd ed. 1981: 162)
stated:
?Thus we are quite justified in arriving at the conclusion that ?a?kara?s
doctrine
is out of count so far as the s?tras are concerned, whatever be its value
as a
philosophical system?.
Apparently, Nagaraj Paturi had personal reasons for not at all addressing
my questions
to him; no need to pursue this issue. If I remember correctly, even Hacker
(relying on
colophons, while deviating from his own proper principles of investigation)
accepted
the traditional view (particularly in ???geri, cf. hereto Peter
Stephan, *Erl?sung
im *
*Spannungsfeld von aktivem Leben und Entsagung. Eine Studie zu **?a?kar**as
Exegese *
*der Bhagavadg?t?*. Aachen 2002: 99) of ascribing the authorship of the
*Vivekac???ma?i*
to ?a?kara. Otherwise, among others (as referred to), ?r?
Saccid?nandendrasarasvat?
of Holenarsipur, who considered such an ascription as na?ve (
*avic?rarama??yat?*; cf.
his *Vedanta-Prakriya Pratyabhijna*, Holenarsipur 1964: 13), providing good
reasons,
and argued for ascribing that work to ?r? ?a?kar?nanda.
Kind regards, Hartmut
