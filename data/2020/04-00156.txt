Probably, if somebody explicitly provides references to the sources of
given

quotations, everybody can understand these. Nobody denied ?a?kar?c?rya's

employment/interpretation of the term *m?y?* as such (to the contrary).

Mayeda?s old investigations of various works ascribed to ?a?kara being
well-known,

yet given that authorship studies often initiate, rather than conclude, the
given

issue, I?d rather be interested in learning about more recent studies
addressing

the authorship of the *Gau?ap?d?yabh??ya* particularly with a focus on how

significant technical terms were understood by respectively Gau?ap?da and

the author of this *B**h??ya*. That is, beyond Bouy?s unfortunately in some
respects

somewhat problematic Gau?ap?da monograph that has received an excellent
review

by J. Hanneder (Indo-Iranian Journal 46 [2003]: 161-165), who had to
conclude:

?To follow ?a?kara in sensitive interpretational details is philologically
and

historically inadmissible and B?s treatment of Gau?ap?da?s work is in this
respect

a step back to the outdated interpretation of Karmarkar?.



The mere differences of understanding technical terms and philosophical
intentions

between Gau?ap?da and the Bh??yak?ra would, however, not necessarily serve
to

reject ?a?kar?c?rya?s authorship of this *B**h??ya* (but then rather throw
some interesting

light on ?a?kara?s hermeneutical relationship to his, traditionally
speaking, Guru?s

Guru). Ironically somebody might even assert that twisting the meaning of
passages

in texts ?a?kara comments upon is actually part of his philosophical
trademark and,

e.g., refer to V. S. Ghate?s study of the BSBh, often taken as the
reference work for

evaluating the authorship of other works ascribed to ?a?kara.

Ghate (*The Ved?nta. A Study of the Brahma-s?tras with the Bh??yas of
?a?kara, *

*R?m?nuja, Nimb?rka, Madhva and Vallabha*, Poona, 3rd ed. 1981: 162)
stated:

?Thus we are quite justified in arriving at the conclusion that ?a?kara?s
doctrine

is out of count so far as the s?tras are concerned, whatever be its value
as a

philosophical system?.



Apparently, Nagaraj Paturi had personal reasons for not at all addressing
my questions

to him; no need to pursue this issue. If I remember correctly, even Hacker
(relying on

colophons, while deviating from his own proper principles of investigation)
accepted

the traditional view (particularly in ???geri, cf. hereto Peter
Stephan, *Erl?sung
im *

*Spannungsfeld von aktivem Leben und Entsagung. Eine Studie zu **?a?kar**as
Exegese *

*der Bhagavadg?t?*. Aachen 2002: 99) of ascribing the authorship of the
*Vivekac???ma?i*

to ?a?kara. Otherwise, among others (as referred to), ?r?
Saccid?nandendrasarasvat?

of Holenarsipur, who considered such an ascription as na?ve (
*avic?rarama??yat?*; cf.

his *Vedanta-Prakriya Pratyabhijna*, Holenarsipur 1964: 13), providing good
reasons,

and argued for ascribing that work to ?r? ?a?kar?nanda.



Kind regards, Hartmut
