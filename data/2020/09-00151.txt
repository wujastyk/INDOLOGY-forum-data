Dear Colleagues,

Please allow me to announce a new publication:

Rosane Rocher, with Agnes Stache-Weiske, /For the Sake of the Vedas. The 
Anglo-German Life of Friedrich Rosen 1805?1837,
/Abhandlungen f?r die Kunde des Morgenlandes, vol. 118, XX?396 pages, 
ISBN 978-3-447-11448-6, available in printed paperback form and as e-book.
https://www.harrassowitz-verlag.de/For_the_Sake_of_the_Vedas/title_6630.ahtml 


?If it were not for the Vedas, the university alone would not keep me in 
London? I like to compare myself to an Indian muni, who forsakes other 
concerns for a while to read the Vedas in peace and attain Indra?s 
heaven, which in my case might be some German university.? Friedrich 
Rosen thus wrote his teacher Bopp in 1830. Drawing primarily from a vast 
correspondence, most of it unpublished, this biography documents and 
analyzes his resolve and its impact on the rise of European Indology. 
The works of this first PhD in Sanskrit at a German university and first 
professor of Sanskrit at a British university include the first edition 
and translation of the first book of the Rigveda, with notes incomplete 
at his untimely death, and the first edition and translation of the 
oldest Arabic treatise on algebra. Yet more momentous was the help Rosen 
gave to continental scholars from Humboldt, Schlegel, and Burnouf to 
beginners, with sources uniquely accessible in England. He also 
exercised his influence on the Oriental Translation Fund to publish 
their works as models of critical and comparative scholarship. His 
mentor Humboldt acknowledged ?I can only deeply regret that we ? must be 
deprived of your presence. Yet, it is definitely of greater benefit for 
you, and even more for scholarship, that you remain so many years close 
to the sources of the works to which you are devoting yourself.?

With all best wishes,
Rosane Rocher
