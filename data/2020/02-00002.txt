Dear scholars,
It is my pleasure to present before you the following lexicon
Rabhasako?a of Rabhasap?la.
https://github.com/sanskrit-kosha/kosha/blob/master/rabhasakosha_rabhasapala/orig/rabhasakosha.txt

As the kosha is unavailable to us, the work has been presented by using a
1963 Ph.D. thesis available at
https://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/handle/10603/145373

Title -
The Rabhasakosa - reconstructed on the basis of quotations found in the
commentarial literature

Author -
Mahadevan, R

With regards,
--
