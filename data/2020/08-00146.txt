Dear Jon,
The copyright page for the Motilal Banarsidass reprint of 1999 of their first edition of 1993 describes this edition as: ?(Text and translation taken from the Allahabad edition of 1925 with minor correction and revision)?. I copied this from a Google Books preview (https://books.google.com/books?id=P4V6BE1_bdwC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false <https://books.google.com/books?id=P4V6BE1_bdwC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false>).
I do not see an introduction in this volume or the 1925 volume available at archive.org <http://archive.org/>. In the 2 page preface Sandal writes that he began study of Hindu philosophy in his old age. If there is an introduction in the 1980 edition, it may not be Sandal?s work.
I too did not find a copy of a 1980 edition.
