Oggetto: [INDOLOGY] annual report Indian epigraphy 1900

Dear List Members,

I am looking for a copy of the Annual Report on Indian Epigraphy (ARIE) for the year 1920. The record might also be known as Government Order (GO) of the Madras Presidency, and finally as Madras Epigraphical Record (MER).

Does anyone have a pdf?

Thank you,

Alessandro Battistini
