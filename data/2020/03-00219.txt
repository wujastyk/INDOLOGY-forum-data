[INDOLOGY] The study of Sanskrit as the epitome of uselessness
Dear list members,
For those who could not see the attachment with the text regarding
Sanskrit, its useless, and Garc?a M?rquez, here it is. The Sanskrit primer
symbolises the uselessness of the bookshop and the spirit of the bookseller:
"The bookstore is the place where Aureliano Babilonia finds his Sanskrit
primer, and it is owned by a wise Catalan, or a Catalan sage, 'un sabio
catal?n', who arrived in Latin America as a refugee from what the narrator
laconically calls 'one of so many wars' [345: 367]. He is a former Classics
teacher and an instigator of learning which is both arcane and occasionally
functional, like Jos? Arcadio Buend?a?s curiosity. For the Catalan, 'wisdom
was worth nothing if it could not be used to invent a new way of preparing
chickpeas' [337: 357]. This is both a pose and a credo. The Catalan, like
Jos? Arcadio Buend?a, loves useless wisdom but likes to think of wisdom as
useful too. When Aureliano Babilonia first meets the Catalan he has two
drawers full of scribbled pages 'that in some way made ont think of
Melqu?ades' parchments' [345-346: 368]."
Best wishes,
Aleix
