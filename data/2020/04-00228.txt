Dear Colleagues,
Could any of the wizards of online repositories of texts point me to the translation of Tatpuru??hnika of the Mah?bh??ya by Joshi and Roodbergen? I believe it is vol. 4 in their series through Poona. I see other volumes on archive.org, but cannot find this one. I would like to consult 2.2.6 specifically, in case the full text is not online.
Thanks in advance,
