[INDOLOGY] A distraction from the Coronavirus
While everyone will show understanding and keep politely silent if someone
makes minor mistakes in his first attempts at composing Sanskrit verses, it
is difficult to understand why a director in the Indic Academy and renowned
expert in Sanskrit matters would rate a verse containing *spar?atu *with
24-carat gold - if ?carrot? was not intended to express clandestine sarcasm.
With how many carrots would he have scored, let?s say, *sp??atu*?
