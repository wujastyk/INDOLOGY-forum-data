Dear Dominik,
Others may provide a more informed account ? like you, this is not something I?ve given much thought to ? but a quick look at the Digital Corpus of Sanskrit, while still only representing a limited albeit important range of Sanskrit literature, lists nearly 500 instances for ko?a, starting with ?g Veda (41 occurrences), Atharvaveda (13 occurrences), Ch?ndogyopani?ad (3 occurrences), A???dhy?y? (A???dhy?y?, 4, 3, 42.0 <http://www.sanskrit-linguistics.org/dcs/index.php?contents=texte&PhraseID=526840> ko??? ?ha? ||),  Buddhacarita (4 occurrences), Hitopade?a (10x), not to mention Abhidharmako?a, Amarako?a, and so on, but only 4 instances of ko?a (Nighantu?e?a 1x, Vi??upur??a 1x, and ?ry?sapta?at? 2x), the nod would seem to overwhelmingly favor ko?a. The term can have a range of meanings aside from encyclopedic compendium or lexicon, so many of those instances may reflect a variety of different meanings.
best,
Dan
