Thank you to Madhav Deshpande, Roland Steiner, Nagaraj Paturi,
AleksandarUsk  (and Christophe Vielle (who gave me the reference  Borooah,
A comprehensive grammar of the Sanskrit language, vol. 10: Prosody, 1883,
p. 100 ?207, as a sub-type of tri?.tup, without any name.)
for this fascinating discussion.
1) I couldn't find Mand?ramarandacamp? published in the K?vyam?l? series,
No. 52, Bombay 1895 in archive.org and the link to this text in
sanskritbooks.org (which was to an archive.org address) is broken. Does
anyone have a pdf or a link to an online copy?
2) The three volume enhanced Apte dictionary that Madhav refererd to, is
in  the Cologne Digital Sanskrit Dictionaries websiet
https://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/ but only available on special
request. I'm assuming this is because it is considered to be still under
copyright and not in the public domain.
Madhav gave me this information about the edition: 1959 edition published
in Pune by Prasad Prakashan, with editors P. K. Gode and C. G. Karve. But
the Cologne Digital Sanskrit Dictionaries website gives a publication date
of 1957.
if it was published after  21 January 1958 then the Copyright Act of 1957
applies and it wont be in the public domain until 60 years after the
editors date of death. But if the Cologne Digital Sanskrit Dictionaries
website date of publication (1957) for the dictionary is correct then it
should be in the public domain.
