Dear Fabrizio,

thank you very much for pointing me out Mir Mahmud. I am far more
interested in biographies than in alchemy. It should be relevant for my
purposes also to know if we have any document (hopefully in Latin)
regarding Indian alchemists in European royal courts or in the Middle-East
and North Africa.

Sincerely,
Paolo
