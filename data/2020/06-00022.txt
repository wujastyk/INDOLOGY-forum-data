[INDOLOGY] poison
Dear Jonathan,
I believe vi?a??stra, as its name implies, is a general term for toxicology, dealing with things like poisons, venoms, etc. Many medical works have sections on this. The Caraka-sa?hit? called this kaum?rabh?tyakam; the Su?ruta called it agadatantra; Vagbhata called it da???r?. Yijing, in his survey of Indian Medicine, called it ????? (cf. T 54.2125.223b28-23c6).
Some of our illustrious colleagues who deal with that literature can perhaps guide you to more specific sources.
best,
Dan
