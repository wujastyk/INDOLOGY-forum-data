[INDOLOGY] Johannes Bronkhorst's picture of early India's intellectual history
I planned a conference for last month on this very issue, and Tim was one
of the invited speakers.  See
   - https://www.eventleaf.com/greatermagadha
But it had to be cancelled, back in March, due to the obvious.
We are currently in active discussion about whether to hold it as a
physical conference next April, or maybe June, or whether to go virtual.
We're all getting much more used to virtual than formerly: it's getting
normalized.  And there are advantages but also you lose a lot by not having
folks in the same room.
I have made a new website,

where you can register as an "attendee" if you want to receive future
information about this meeting.
Best,
Dominik
