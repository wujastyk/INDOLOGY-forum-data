Dear Friends, I may be late to the party, but I just saw news of a
supremely well-deserved honor and a welcome piece of good news in our
kaliyuga=

Sally J. Sutherland Goldman and Robert P. Goldman have been awarded the AK
Ramanujan book prize for their annotated translation of the V?lm?ki
R?m?ya?a's final volume, Uttarak???a, the conclusion of their legendary and
standard-setting R?m?ya?a translation project. Congratulations to the two
of you!

It is creative apperception more than anything else that makes the
individual feel that life is worth living. Contrasted with this is a
relationship to external reality which is one of compliance, the world and
its details being recognized but only as something to be fitted in with or
demanding adaptation. Compliance carries with it a sense of futility for
the individual and is associated with the idea that nothing matters and
that life is not worth living. In a tantalizing way many individuals have
experienced just enough creative living to recognize that for most of their
time they are living uncreatively, as if caught up in the creativity of
someone else, or of a machine.--Donald Winnicott, *Playing and Reality*
