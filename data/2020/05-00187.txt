                            Dear Friends,

            Does anyone have access to this 2 volumed book?
                      Tantr?gam?ya dharma-dar?
                      by  Vrajavallabha Dvived?
 Hathi Trust has an ebook version, but only allows one to search for
    word counts, but not view the pages (if VPN is reset to USA).

 It supposedly has a discussion of the Siddh?ntas?r?vali and the rule
  for fixing the widths of the sarvasama-li?gas. If there are other
      discussions of this that are available, please let me know.

                              Thank you.

                            All the best,

                            ?????????????
