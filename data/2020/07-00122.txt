[INDOLOGY] Scan tent
Dear John, I've never tried to buy one, but there's an "order" button on
this web page:
   - https://readcoop.eu/scantent/
If you do get one, I'd love to hear your experience with it.  If it's as
good as it sounds, I'll get one too.  I don't have thousands of images like
you, but I do some manuscript photography in India from time to time.  I've
used a downward-facing Nikon on a tripod with a remote shutter release in
the past.  Good results, but quite a fiddly setup, and good light is
usually difficult.
Best,
Dominik
