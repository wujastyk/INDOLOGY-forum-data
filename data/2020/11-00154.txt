[INDOLOGY] Anniversary of INDOLOGY
I want to add my congratulations too for these very interesting 
discussions and resources.
Although, in my opinion, there are not enough questions and answers 
concerning Indian Mathematics and Astronomy.
But this is definitely not a reproach to be addressed to Dominik !
Best wishes,
