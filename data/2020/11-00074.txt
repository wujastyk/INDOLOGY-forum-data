Very sad news.
Dr. Alexander Dubianski (27.04.1941-18.11.2020) passed away today after suffering from pneumonia caused by coronavirus.
Colleagues, students and friends knew him as a very kind and generous person with great love for life, Tamil language and poetry.
In youth Dr. Dubianski aspired to become a musician and studied at the Moscow Conservatoire, however, his education was interrupted by military service.  After returning from the army, he graduated and did his PhD at the Moscow State University, where he got interested in Indology and later taught Tamil language and literature for more than 40 years. He also taught at the Russian State University for the Humanities.
He is most known for his book ?Ritual and Mythological Sources of the Early Tamil Poetry? Groningen, 2000.
During the last 12 years Dr.Dubianski was conducting an informal seminar on Classical Tamil literature, in which a circle of his former students participated.  His last unfinished work was full Russian translation of Na??i?ai.

and friend Alexander Dubiansky (b. 1941) died in Moscow this morning
because of Covid.
We shall miss him very much.
I include a picture taken in Paris on 28th september 2019 during the 4th
European Tamil conference. This was the last occasion for Eva and me to
meet with him face to face.
