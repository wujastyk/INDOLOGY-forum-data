[INDOLOGY] Academia.edu and privacy issues
I've discovered that the puzzlingly appropriate recommendations I've
received are being sent not from the domain academia.edu but from
academia-mail.com.  But I think it is still the same outfit, so not
phishing.  I've written to ask them what's going on.   Looking at
their notification
system <https://www.academia.edu/settings#email-notifications> I'm
wondering if it's that, somehow working much better than one would
imagine.  But that doesn't explain your examples.
