[INDOLOGY] Claus Oetke
Very sorry to learn of the untimely passing away of Prof. Claus Oetke of
whom I have lively memories since the last World Sanskrit Conference in
Australia (the one in Melbourne) and several other occasions. His numerous
contributions to Indian philosophy, to Philosophy and to philosophical
argumentation are unforgettable. Condolences to his family and friends.
