In the Tamil Vai??ava hagiographic work ???yirappa?i Kuruparampar?prap?vam, the C??a king orders the two Vai??ava devotees Periyanampi and K?ratt??v?? to be punished with netrop??ana (the word netrop??anam is used in the text). Immediately K?ratt??v?? used his own nails to take out his own eyes while the king?s men carried out the orders on Periyanampi. (See p. 256 of the 2006 edition)

 

On the ?aiva side, we have the story of Ti??a? (who later is called by ?iva as ?Ka??appa? (the respectable person of the eye)) in the Periyapur??am in which Ti??a? takes out his own eyes with his arrow to replace the bleeding eyes of ?ivali?ga). Here is a sculpture of the episode. https://www.flickr.com/photos/26216916 at N05/2464433626/

Dear Colleagues,

 

I take the advantage of the muted attempts at postmodern creative writing in Sanskrit to post a request pertaining to the study of material culture and social history in mediaeval India. My source is a representative of ? if I might say so ? ?Sanskrit literary realism?, namely Kavi ?r?vara, who depicts a technique of blinding in his R?jatara?gi?? as it was practised in Kashmir between c. AD 1472 and 1474.

 

Most of you will certainly be aware of the prevailing practice in South Asia of using acid, and possibly of the touching blinding scene shown in Slumdog Millionaire:

but what ?r?vara was watching as an eyewitness at the royal court he was serving in Sultanate Kashmir was done differently. It comes closer to the verbatim meaning of netra-utp??ana (?tearing out one?s eyes?), as they seem to have gouged out the eyes of the victim, to wit, Bahr?m Kh?n, pretender to the throne and uncle of the ruling Sultan Hassan:

 

tasya t?l?cite netradvaye tapt?? ?al?kik?m |

Jonar?j?nako lauh?? d??n???rtham ad?payat || III.107 ||

 

[107]In order to destroy [Bahr?m?s] eyesight, the R?j?naka Jona administered a red-hot copper needle to [his] eyeballs, which had been covered with cotton.

 

?r?vara comments:

nairgh??yam ak?ihartur yat k????k?asya ca y? vyath? |

dvaya? na ?akyate vaktu? yath?rtha? m?d???? gir? || III.108 ||

 

[108][Poets] like me have no words to express in an adequate manner the heartlessness of the one who took his eyes and the agony of the one from whom they were torn.

 

It is not the only instance of netrotp??ana in his work, however to my present knowledge it is the only one to render precise details.

In preparation of a new edition and annotated translation of ?r?vara?s masterpiece I would like to ask if someone might be aware of any other source having preserved details of the techniques of blinding in India? My request does not concern the undisputed occurrence of netrotp??ana, but only the techniques, if known.

 

On- and off-list replies would be equally welcome.

 

Thanking you,

 

Walter Slaje
