What happens after that is someone else's responsibility.
However, in 2009, the organizers of The Pirate Bay were successfully
prosecuted by a consortium of media publishers for sharing links on a
massive scale (The Pirate Bay Trial
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pirate_Bay_trial#cite_note-132>).  The
discussion was about torrent file sharing links, mind you, which could
perhaps be distinguished from ordinary URLs.
I think the likelihood that a consortium of media publishers will pursue
anyone for sharing a link to the Chanda?s?tra is vanishingly small.
