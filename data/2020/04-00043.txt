Dear All,
We have been talking about the G?yatr? a lot.
As it is the weekend, for your amusement:
The Scifi TV channel is streaming (free) all 50+ episodes of their old "Battleship Galactica" series now:

Did anyone notice that the theme song of each episode is the G?yatr?:
"o? bh?r bhuva? sv?h?(!).  Tat savitur ? pracoday?t"
Cheers!
Michael
