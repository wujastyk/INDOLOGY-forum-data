Coronavirus - ?Touch me not? 3

This new Yoga of No Touch is brought to you by the Coronavirus.  I shall
not touch anything and I have turned away even from my own face.

If touching is forbidden, of what use are the two of us.  With this worry,
the two hands just look at each other from a distance.
