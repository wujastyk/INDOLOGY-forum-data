Madhav,

Like you I wondered what time span the writer meant by "  l??poque
moderne." .  The full sentence reads "La mention du *k**?**laka *est
courante ? l??poque moderne.[A.P.]"
  Are [A.P.] the initials of the contributing author or something else:?

There is also the statement in the TAK article: Les manuels de rituel qui
mentionnent le *k**?**laka *le donnent

comme form? par un des ?l?ments constitutifs (mot ou syllabe) du

mantra. Une telle mention ne para?t pas ?tre tr?s ancienne. [A.P.]


But the TAK article  doesn't give the names of these ritual manuals that
mention kIlaka.

I see the *k?laka *in the R?marak??stotra, but there is no *argal? *in it.
