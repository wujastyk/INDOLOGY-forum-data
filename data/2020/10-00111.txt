[INDOLOGY] Mosquitoes
Dear James,
there is indeed very little. About mosquitoes my files only have, beside Jolly, one small note:
SCHWENTNER, E. 1954. ?Drohne und M?cke?, KZ71, 198.
This, I suppose, is from Indo-Europeean perspective. IE is at least the next:
Wood, Francis Asbury 1920. ?Names of Stinging, Gnawing and Rending Animals?, AJPh41, 223?239 & 336?354.
For other disease-carrying insects I could add:
Thieme, Paul 1965. ?Die rigvedische Tierbezeichnungen?, KZ79, 211?223 (Kleine Schriften214?227) has at least flies.
On bugs and fleas:
BURROW, T. 1974. ?Sanskrit matku?a-and utku?a-?, Ksi?ga pami?tkowa ku czi Eugeniusza S?uszkiewicza.Warszawa, 53?56.
LIEBICH, B. 1927. ?Floh oder Wanze??, ZII5, 153?163 (in Pa?catantra).
Finally, I cannot say, what this is, as I have not seen it:
*Moses, S. T. 1926. ?Insect Pests and Some South Indian Beliefs?, QJMS16, 1925/26, 15?19.
Best,
Klaus

[INDOLOGY] Mosquitoes
Dear colleagues,
I?ve been asked whether I know of any studies of mosquitoes or other disease-carrying insects in Indian literature. I don?t, and a search of the indology archive reveals nothing either. I would be very grateful for any suggestions.
Yours, with best wishes,
Jim
