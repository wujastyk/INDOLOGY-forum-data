[INDOLOGY] question about bookseller
Dear Herman,
I think you can order "K. Rajan, Early writing System" at the 
Archaeological Society of Tamil Nadu. As I don't know the actual 
situation due to the COVID 19, you may directly place your order with 
Prof K. Rajan and here is his e-mail: rajanarchy at gmail.com
 ?I will check for Dilip Kumar and will get back to you.
Best regards
Murugaiyan
