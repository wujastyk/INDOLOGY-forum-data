Subject: [INDOLOGY] Searching for a manuscript from Aufrecht's Florentine Sanskrit Manuscript Catalogue
Message-ID: <CAM56PcqW6XA+s-6HNT09ooxs8=XrQJ+XQLNkC5SkEXEbwKz1uw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

Thank you very much for adding me to the list! I hope someone can help me
with advice regarding the Florentine Manuscript Collection catalogued by T.
Aufrecht (1892,
https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.313471/page/n1/mode/2up). I
am looking for a manuscript of the Prabodhaprak??as?ra (454) in the
Instituto di Studi Superiori, which Aufrecht lists on p.156 of the
'Florentine Sanskrit Manuscripts' as well as on p.79 of the Catalogus
Catalogorum (1891,
https://archive.org/details/b30094124_0002/page/n87/mode/2up).
What would be the best way to find out if the Instituto di Studi Superiori
still exists and whether or not it has the manuscript? Who is the right
person to contact if I want to procure a scan of the manuscript (of course
when travel resumes and libraries begin to function safely)? I would very
much appreciate some advice.

Sincerely,
Radhika
