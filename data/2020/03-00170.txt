Dear list members,

A colleague from the Institute for Classical Archaeology has sent me 
this picture of what seems to be a fairly recent panel discovered in 
Rajasthan. I can interpret the iconography but I cannot decipher the 
inscription. I would be very grateful to you if you could indicate what 
the latter says and/or refer me to similar images.

Many thanks in advance for your helpful replies!

All the best,
Jessie Pons
