Dear Madhav,

Surprisingly, the commentary (/M?dhuryara?jan?vy?khy?/) confirms this fault:

/narau naga?araga?au ro raga?a? / GAU GURUDVAYAM //

I guess that the correct entry in the three volume edition of Apte's  
dictionary could be taken from Velankar's /Jayad?man /(Bombay 1949, p.  
126):

"/nararalaga R?jaha?s? /(6,5) Mm. 9.11, /Vibh??a?? /Vjs [=  
/V?ttaj?tisamuccaya /of V?raha?ka] 4.94"

By the way, the definition /kanakama?jar? na? ca rau lagau/ is itself  
written in this meter (/na ra ra la ga/; caesura after the 6th  
syllable) - a practice that was probably first introduced by Jayadeva  
(leaving aside the hardly datable /N??ya??stra/).

Best wishes,
Roland Steiner
