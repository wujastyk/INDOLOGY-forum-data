[INDOLOGY] FW: [ctamil] Alexander Dubiansky (1941-2020)
I?m very sorry to hear about the passing away of my friend Sasha Dubyanskij. 
Among his principal works I would like to mention the new Russian handbook of the Dravidian languages, of which he was the chief editor:
Dubyanskij, A. M., E. B. Markus, N. V. Gurov & A. A. Kibrik (eds.) 2013. Yazyki mira: Dravidijskie yazyki. Moskva: Academia. 584 pp. Hb ISBN 978-5-87444-369-6.
