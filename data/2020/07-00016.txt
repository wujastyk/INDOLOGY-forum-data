=?utf-8?Q?Re:_[INDOLOGY]_Sa=E1=B9=83matu?=
Dear Martin, have you considered the possibility that the sign you read as
u at the end is A) in fact a vir?ma; or B) a scribal error for what was
meant to be a vir?ma? Given that it is a north Indian manuscript, a
Telugu-ish ending seems unlikely as you say. I am sure I have seen "sa?vat"
written (on a copper plate in Nagari) with a vir?ma that looked very much
like an u. I have no particular recollection of ever seeing sa?mat instead
of sa?vat, but it sa?mat would not be a strange development.
