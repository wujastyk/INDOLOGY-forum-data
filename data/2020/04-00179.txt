Dear Prof. Jha,
No ??i-status required: it is not that difficult to derive *y?ji* as action
noun from *yaj* ?to venerate (ritually)?, ?to sacrifice? (hence having a
meaning equivalent to another action noun derived from *yaj*: *yaj?a*
'(ritualized)
veneration', 'sacrifice').
See P??ini?s A???dhy?y? 3.3.110 *vibh???khy?napra?nayor i? ca* and the
K??ik?.
If I understood correctly, Vasi??ha is replying to a question of king
Da?aratha, so the form could probably be justified in the context of the
story ;)
In addition, there is U??dis?tra p?da 4, s?tra ca. 124-134 (depending on
the edition): *vasivapiyaji...v?ribhya i?*.
Commentaries give here examples of mostly feminine action nouns, but in the
case of *y?ji* some commentaries explain the meaning, exceptionally, as an
agent noun : sacrificer. ?abdakalpadruma vol. 4 p. 31 gives *y?ji* as a
masculine noun and notes that it means sacrifice, but acc. to another
authority: sacrificer. Wackernagel AiG Band 2, 2 p. 301 mentions an
occurrence of *y?ji *(also in Hauschild's Register p. 190) in the sense
'offering' ('das Opfern') in Manu 10.79, but this must be a mistake for
*yaji* which I see in all editions available to me and which, unlike *y?ji*,
gives a correct metre.
Best regards,
Jan Houben
