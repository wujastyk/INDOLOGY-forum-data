[INDOLOGY] Idenfication of Sanskrit metres
Dear List,
I would appreciate it if someone could point to a good programme for the identification of Sanskrit and Indic metres. Apparently, the set up by Robert Scharf (http://sanskrit.sai.uniheidelberg.de/Chanda/HTML/) is not longer found.
Many thanks,
Ken
