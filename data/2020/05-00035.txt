*The Legacy of Vai??avism in Colonial Bengal*
Edited by Ferdinando Sardella and Lucian Wong
Routledge Hindu Studies Series

Bringing together scholars from across the disciplines of social and
intellectual history, philology, theology, and anthropology to
systematically investigate Vai??avism in colonial Bengal, this book
highlights the significant roles?religious, social, and cultural?that a
prominent Hindu devotional current played in the lives of wide and diverse
sections of colonial Bengali society. Not only does the book thereby enrich
our understanding of the history and development of Bengali Vai??avism, but
it also sheds valuable new light on the texture and dynamics of colonial
Hinduism beyond the discursive and social-historical parameters of an
entrenched Hindu ?Renaissance? paradigm.
