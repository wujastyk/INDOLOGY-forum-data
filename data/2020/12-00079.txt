Dear all,

I am hoping that someone might be able to provide me with the BORI
Descriptive Catalogues for grammatical texts. I have only Vol. II; Part II
on non-P??inian Schools, but I can't find the first volume/parts (although
I thought I had them at some point).

I have also been slightly perplexed about the publication of the
K?vyak?madhenu, V/Bopadeva's auto-commentary on the Kavikalpadruma. From
what I've found on archive.org and the bibliography in the Encyclopedia of
Indian Philosophy (The Philosophy of the Grammarians), it seems not, but I
would be happy if this weren't the case. I have found an MS on the
archive.org.

Many thanks and a good start to a happier new year.

All the Best,
Victor
