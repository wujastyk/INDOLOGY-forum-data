[INDOLOGY] Anandasrama editions
Dear colleagues,
Allen Thrasher put the following message on Indology (14.6.2017): "Jim Nye of the University of Chicago Library told me that when Anandasrama did a second edition of the same work it would start from scratch, so that another ASS edition of the same title will be a different text." I have meanwhile found that this appears to be true of its editions of the Sarvadar?anasa?graha.
I have inspected two ?nand??rama editions of the Sarvadar?anasa?graha:
(1) one published in 1950;
and
(2) one published in 1977.
Both are no. 51 in the series called ?nand??ramasa?sk?tagranth?vali, and both also include Madhus?dana Sarasvat?'s Prasth?nabheda. According to the title pages, edition (1) is the third impression (a?kan?v?tti), edition (2) the fourth. Edition (1) has been prepared (sa??odhita) by Vin?yaka Ga?e?a ?pa?e with the help of the Pandits of the ?nand??rama; edition (2) only by the Pandits of the ?nand??rama. The text of the Sarvadar?anasa?graha covers 171 pages in edition (1); 174 pages in edition (2). Both editions contain the same list of manuscripts (?dar?apustakollekhapatrik?; edition (2) contains its first mistake in this list, misnaming ms. gha as ba) and the same list of chapters (edition (1) calls it atha sarvadar?anasa?grah?ntargatadar?an?n?m anukrama?; edition (2) calls is anukrama?ik?). Edition (1) then has a preface to the second impression (dvit?y?v?ttisa?bandhi nivedanam) and an introduction (upodgh?ta); edition (2) has neither of these two.
The two editions are not identical. For example, edition (1) has, on p. 128 l. 15: prasajyeteti cet na; edition (2) (p. 130 l. 15) has just prasajyeta. Numerous other examples could no doubt be added.
Interestingly, the editors of Erich Frauwallner's Nachgelassene Werke II (Wien 1992) thought that Frauwallner had used the ?nand??rama edition of 1977 (abbreviation: SDS1) for his translation of parts of the chapter on ?a?kara's philosophy (along with Abhyankar's edition), which is of course impossible (Frauwallner died in 1974). This sometimes leads to confusion, as when the editors point out on p. 200 fn. 108 that the last p?da of a ?loka in the 1977 ?nand??rama edition (p. 152 l. 22) "erscheint ... nur verst?mmelt"; this is true, but this p?da is perfectly in order in the 1950 edition (p. 150 l. 12).
