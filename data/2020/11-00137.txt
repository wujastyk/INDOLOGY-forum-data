[INDOLOGY] Anniversary of INDOLOGY
Thank you, Dominik. The Indology list, in its incarnations, has had a significant impact on our lives for decades. Scholars no longer work alone, awaiting the day when they can visit a library or archive that might solve their accumulated questions by providing otherwise hard to acquire sources. You have provided us with a resource that pools all our resources, improving everyone?s research.
Stay safe and healthy,
Dan
