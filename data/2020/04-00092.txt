Dear list members,

Firstly, I wish you all to stay safe and healthy.

I would be very grateful if any of you could kindly provide me with a 
PDF of volumes 2 and 7 of "T.V. Mahalingam, A topographical list of 
Inscriptions in the Tamil Nadu and Kerala States, ICHR, New Delhi."

Thanks in advance and best regards.
A. Murugaiyan
