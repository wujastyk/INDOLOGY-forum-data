[INDOLOGY] MacDevnag on 64-bit systems
I don't use LaTeX, and have used MicroSoft Word for Devanagari in the
past.  However, for some reason, while Word for Windows supports the use of
Unicode Devanagari, Word for Mac OS does not support typing Unicode
Devanagari. So I am left to work with OpenOffice and LibreOffice.  I am now
thinking of installing Windows on my MacBook and see if I can work with
Word for Windows on my MacBook.  I would appreciate to hear the experiences
of Mac users with Unicode Devanagari. Best wishes,
