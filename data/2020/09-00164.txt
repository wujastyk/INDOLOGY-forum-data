[INDOLOGY] MacDevnag on 64-bit systems
Thanks, Dominik and Gary,
     I just tried LibreOffice and it opened my Word file without major
distortions.  So that is one option.  Will try to update my Word for Mac as
suggested by Gary and see if that alleviates my problems with Devanagari.
I think the problem is not so much with Apple, but with Word for Mac.
