Dear Christophe
Have you found a way to order this work? I read that I may order it "by 
telefax", or from the publisher's website, but I haven't seen a fax 
machine in years and I can't find the book on the website of ?ditions de 
Boccard (http://www.deboccard.com/fr/5366-category 
<https://apc01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.deboccard.com%2Ffr%2F5366-category&data=02%7C01%7Cwill.sweetman%40otago.ac.nz%7C8917bd1b417a4b60e14f08d80ac82151%7C0225efc578fe4928b1579ef24809e9ba%7C1%7C1%7C637271202013071846&sdata=BCn7r%2BC1j44FVzY3ijH8UNSD6o%2FnOY4o6Iwuw7SrrUg%3D&reserved=0>) 
or anywhere else online.
Greetings from a newly COVID-free New Zealand!
