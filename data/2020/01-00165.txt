Dear Hartmut,
In his message to you, Prof. Schlingloff may have modestly omitted a
reference to a publication of his that is in fact quite relevant in this
regard:
D. Schlingloff, *The Superhuman Faculties - Visual Meditation and Miracles
in Buddhist Literature and Art*, Buddhismus Studien 9.
In addition, it may or may not help to date and localise *siddh?c?rya*
A?vagho?a,
but could the "Siddha" part in his title point to a "southern" (not
necessarily as south as Tamil Nadu, but up to around the Parvata mountain
mentioned in the VP) and rasa??stric connection (alleged flying experiences
through mercury)?
Jan Houben
N.B.
The itikartavyat? of the quotation may be clear: don't eat meat.
But what would the verse really express in its original context?
Or what type of  ?k??agamana is it referring to?
?k??ag?mino vipr?? patanti m??sabhak?a??t |
vipr???? patana? d???v? tato m??s?ni varjayet ||12||
"Due to consuming meat, the space-walking seers do fall (or fly, which is
the older meaning of pat?).
Hence, observing the seers? fall (patana rather than p?ta refers rather to
the actual falling, flying?) one should abandon meats."
Did these "seers" fall from the sky like Simon Magus after St Peter's
prayer?
Were they first staying up in space, enjoyed some meat there just like Mary
Poppins and Uncle Albert drinking tea at the ceiling of the living room,
and did they fall down next?
