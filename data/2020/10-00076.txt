[INDOLOGY] Six calamities
Dear all,
A quick follow-up note with a couple of typos corrected in the passages I cited (for those who care, see below) plus some further references to Sanskrit sources from Ludwig Sternbach, Juridical Studies in Ancient Indian Law, Part I (MLBD, 1965), pp. 55?58:
9  Vis Major
A. There existed praesumptio juris ac de jure that the depositary
was always responsible for the loss, destruction, or damage
of the object deposited i.e., that he did not exercise the diligentia
quam suis rebus. Only if the loss, destruction, or damage were
caused by vis major this praesumptio had not to be applied. This
is clear from K?ty (593) wher[e] we read:
nik?iptam yasya yat ki?cit tat prayatnena p?layet,
daiva-r?ja-k?t?d anyo vin??as tasya k?rtyate
(Also quoted in SC 179, VyPr 282, VyS 87)
The non-responsibility on the part of the depositary in
case of loss, destruction, or damage of the object deposited
caused by vis major was very clearly regulated in Y (2.66).
We read there na d?pyo 'pah?ta? ta? tu r?ja-daivika-taskarai?
(Also quoted m ViR ad Y 2.68, SC 179, VRK 88,
NrP 24, SV 266, VyPr 281, VyU 80, VyM 85, VT 558,
VyS 87, AP 254.26)
We find here the most typical examples of vis major, i.e.
the act of king (r?j?), the act of God destiny, fate (daiva, deva),
and the act of thieves ( taskara). Every plundering, by the
forces of a king (foreign king), etc.?was an act of king, every
cataclysm (caused by water, fire, etc.)?was an act of God,
and every loss caused by the act of men (robbers, thieves)?
as an act of thieves.
Some sources of law, such as N (II.9), Brh (XII.10)
and Katy, (593/4 ), enumerate as vis major r?jadaiva only,
others, such as Mn (VIII.189) and almost identically N (XII.12)
mention stealing by thieves (caura), destruction of
things by water (jala) or burning by fire (agni). Certainly
this, rather casuistic, enumeration, is Identical with that quoted
above. The most casuistic enumeration of vis major is
found in K ( 177/ 13?17) were we read "Whenever forts,
or country parts are destroyed by enemies, or wild tribes,
whenever villagers, merchants, 01 herds of cattle are subjected
to the inroads of invaders, whenever the kingdom Itself is destroyed,
whenever extensive fires or floods bring about entire
destruction of v1llages or partly destroy Immovable properties,
movable properties having been rescued before, whenever
the spread of fire, or rush of floods is so sudden that even movable
properties could not be removed, or whenever a ship
laden with commodities is either sunk or plundered (by
pirates), deposits lost in any of the above ways shall not be
reclaimed.? In reality it was not a casuistic enumeration
of cases of vis major, but rather an interpretation of r?jadaiva.   [etc.]

Re: [INDOLOGY] Six calamities
Dear Madhav, Johannes, et al.
Fire is indeed included (alongside flood/water) as a disaster or (from the point of view of property loss) an ?act of God? or ?force majeure.?   Thus the Artha??stra 4.3.1?2: [1] daiv?ny a??au mah?bhay?ni: agnir udaka? vy?dhir durbhik?a? m??ik? vy?l?? sarp? rak???si, iti.  [2] tebhyo janapada? rak?et.
?1. There are eight great dangers arising from fate: fire, water, disease, famine, rats, vicious animals, snakes, and demons. 2 He [the king? or his Collector (sam?hart?]?] should protect the countryside from these.? (trans. Olivelle 2013: 228; see his note on p. 629).?
I seem to recall similar lists in the N?ti literature, though I cannot lay my hand on a particular passage at the moment.
But this sort of list has been received in the Javanese tradition.  For example, a manuscript entitled A???da?a Vyavah?ra (Perpustakaan Nasional, Jakarta, L. 882) quotes a Sanskrit stanza:
de?abha?gabh?y?t tyakta? kr?ta? [read: hr?ta?] taskarap?rthivai[?] |
agnidagdha? jalanoda? pa?casadara?a? smr?ta? || ff. 2v2?3  [read: ? pa?cas?dh?ra?a??]
What is abandoned from fear of destruction of the country, what is seized by thief or prince, what is burnt by fire, [or] what is carried off by water ? this is known as ?the five common [perils].?
This is glossed in Old Javanese prose (ff. 2v3?3r1):
ka[li?anya], dr?vya ika? sa?ke? rundahni? de?a, kanimitan pra? kati?gal ika? de?adr?vya, tinitipak?n salviranya, pa?u kuna?, dr?vya pinet i? task?ra mali?, dr?vya pinet de sa? prabh?, katunv i? ap?y, dr?vya keli ri? ve, kah?l?m kuna?, ika ta sahacihna, tan yogya kat?mpuhan? ri? pana?gapi, titipan kal?bu ri? pa?casadhara?a, ?a[ranya].
This means: Property that, on account of disorder in the locality, because of war, is abandoned, property of the locality of all types that is placed in trust, or cattle; property taken by a robber [or] thief, property taken by the king, [property] burnt by fire, property carried off by water or sunken ? for things with these characteristics the receiver should not be liable; it is called ?a deposit sunk in the five common [perils].?
This classification gets applied in Old Javanese prose format to entrusted goods at various points in the famous lawbook (14th c.-ish?) edited by Jonker (1885):
Ku??ra M?nava 8 :
d?ve titipan, yen pinet denira sa? amava bh?mi, yen colo??n deni? mali?, yen bahak?n deni? vo?, yen katunon, yen keliya ri? ba?u, yen hila?a katahurag deni? gu?i? pra?, tan v?na? iku palakun?n denika? atitip, apan kapa?cas?dh?ra?a arane.
[In the case of] property that has been put on deposit ? if it is taken by the ruler, if it be stolen by a thief, if it be robbed by someone, if it is burnt up (katunon) [or] if it be carried away by water, if it disappear by being scattered in the heat of war ? if the depositor asks for it back, he or she has no entitlement [to it], for these are known as ?the five common [perils]?
KM 211: ri? titipan kati?gal, ak?ra?a deni? de?a rusak binabak deni? vo?, geger deni? ratu apra? pa?a ratu, i?alap i? mali?, katunon , keli ri? ba?u, tan pa??lenana ka? tinitipan yen ma?kana, pan kapa?cas?dh?ra?a arane, li?ira sa? pa??ita vruh i? ?gama.
Regarding a deposit abandoned because of a village destroyed [and] plundered by men, [lost] in tumult on account of a king at war with kings, taken by a thief, burnt up, carried off by water, what was deposited need not be replaced if it is so, for these are known as ?the five common [perils]? according to scholars knowledgeable in scripture.
Likewise KM 95.  Cf. K?ty?yana Sm?ti 178, 601 and B?haspati Sm. 11.4 for other Sanskrit parallels.

Re: [INDOLOGY] Six calamities
I raise a similar question about the sparsity of epidemics in early literature, in ?Plagues and Brahmins? (Zysk felicitation volume, Brill 2021; has just come out).

Thank you much, dear Peter, for the reference.
Now I can add the following article  by F. Wilhelm in IT, precisely on the topic ("Calamities - a dharma problem?) :

Anyway, the ?loka below (also quoted in a commentary to the final stanza of M?lavik?gnimitra, according to Wilhelm) must be earlier than its occurrence in the K?tyakalpataru and V?ramitrodaya digests.
