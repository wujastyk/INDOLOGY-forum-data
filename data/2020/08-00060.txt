I would also be interested in these two books.  Thanks.  As an aside,
recently one of my portable drives failed and I lost a sizable collection
of downloaded pdf files. The lesson I learned is that every drive needs a
backup drive.  Fortunately, most of those pdfs are there on Archive.org,
Scribd etc., but searching takes a lot of time. With best regards,
