Yes, a great many thanks to Jonathan Silk, Rupert Gethin and Bill Mak for providing the files.
I'd happy to pass them on to whoever else needs them. Feel free to email me.

I, too, would like a copy, if it can be found. Some years ago I had photocopied only a few pages of this book, and would be glad to have the whole. Thanks.

I would greatly appreciate it if anyone has a copy and is able to share it (in particular of volume 1).
