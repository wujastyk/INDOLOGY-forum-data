Dear colleagues,
the chapter of the Carakasa?hita concerned with poison (Cikitsasth?na 
23) is called vi?aciktsitam 
(https://sarit.indology.info/apps/sarit-pm/works/carakasamhita.xml?root=1.5.4.13.50). 
kaum?rabh?tyakam is one of the eight a?gas of Ayurveda and includes 
mostly paediatrics.

There is some specialized information on poisoning in N.M. Penzers 
Appendix III (poison-damsels) in "The Ocean of Story" Vol. 2 from 1924 
(pp. 275?313): 
https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.533752/page/n303/mode/2up 
It was reworked into a an essay later (Poison-Damsels and Other Essays 
in Folklore and Anthropology, 1952).
I believe no one has mentioned this so far.

Best wishes,
Vitus Angermeier
