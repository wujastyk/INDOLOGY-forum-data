[INDOLOGY] sources for the idea that reincarnation is a semi-random process?
Dear Colleagues,
I have read this conversation thread with great interest. I am particularly appreciative of the last two postings by Brendan Gillon and and Dean Anderson, which reflect my own views on this subject. I thank everyone involved for a stimulating discussion.
In case it might be pertinent, I am providing a link to a special issue of Religions which I edited last year on this very topic, covering it from a variety of perspectives. The entire issue can be downloaded for free: https://www.mdpi.com/books/pdfview/book/1097 <https://www.mdpi.com/books/pdfview/book/1097>
All the best,
