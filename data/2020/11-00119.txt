=?utf-8?Q?Re:_[INDOLOGY]_vekura=C3=B1ja?=
I appreciate the additional information and sources. This confirms that for at least some authors, a?vatar? was used for hinny. It is still unclear whether that was specialized usage for just these authors, or implicit for all authors and texts even when not specifically explained as such. That Bh?skaraka??ha and ?nandabodhendrasarasvat??s had to provide that explanation, and in similar terms, might suggest that that meaning of the term was not that well known, thus requiring explanation, as well as suggesting that they are drawing on the same or a similar tradition which, since both lived in the 18th century, may or may not have been how the term was used prior to that time. The term is old, appearing in Br?hma?as, the Ch?ndogya-U., Atharva-veda, Mah?bh?rat?, etc.
Since the Chinese translation of the independent non-Pali version of the Assal?yana sutta was made in the late 4th century, and clearly differentiated mules from hinnies by parentage as well as assigning each its own designation ? ?? juxu for hinny and ? luo for mule ? one might assume that the Indic original did so as well, though that is not available to us. It is possible that a?vatar? was the term translated as juxu, but that is not certain. One might also assume that given the importance of equine species for both Indian and Chinese cultures from an early period, they would have been keen observers of breeding habits.
Female hinnies giving birth to foals is apparently a fairly rare event, but I haven?t seen anything in the modern literature indicating it requires C-sections, though hybrids between lions and tigers (which, since they roam in different territories only happens in captivity, often involves birth defects) do often require C-sections.
Again, thank you for that information.
best wishes,
Dan
