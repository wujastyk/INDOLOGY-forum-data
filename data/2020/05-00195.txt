[INDOLOGY] Altekar's "A history of important ancient towns and cities in Gujarat and Kathiawad, from earliest times to about 1300 A.D."?
I can't find this book in archive.org or in other Google searches on the
internet.  My university library doesn't have it and interlibrary loan
isn't working.
Does anyone here have a scan of this book, by any chance?
