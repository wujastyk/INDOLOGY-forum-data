Help with two articles
Dear colleagues,
If any of you have an  electronic version of the following articles by J. P. Losty, I'd be very grateful if you could share them with me:
?Bengal, Bihar, Nepal? Problems of provenance in 12th century illuminated Buddhist manuscripts?, Oriental Art, v.35/2-3, 1989, pp. 86-96, 140-49.
Best wishes,
Camillo
