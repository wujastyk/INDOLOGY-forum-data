Dear colleagues,

If any of you have an  electronic version of the following articles by J. P. Losty, I'd be very grateful if you could share them with me:

?Bengal, Bihar, Nepal? Problems of provenance in 12th century illuminated Buddhist manuscripts?, Oriental Art, v.35/2-3, 1989, pp. 86-96, 140-49.

Best wishes,

Camillo
