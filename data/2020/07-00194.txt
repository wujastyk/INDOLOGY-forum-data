Dear Madhav (and Tim),

Dear Michael,

     This book is now included among the 100 books that the University of Michigan Press is now planning to put on Open Access using the Open Book Initiative of the NEH.  Will let you all know when this actually goes online.  In the meantime, I will send the pdf for this article to your personal email.  Best,

Madhav

Dear All, a colleague (not on our list) has asked me for a pdf of:


Masica, Colin: Aryan and Non-Aryan elements in North Indian agriculture. In Deshpande, M. M., and P. E. Hook, Eds. Aryan and Non-Aryan in India. Ann Arbor: Karoma. 1979

Though I have the book, I cannot get to our offices/library now.
Any help is greatly appreciated!

Michael
