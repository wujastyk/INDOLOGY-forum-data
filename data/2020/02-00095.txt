Dear all,

I am looking for an electronic copy of the *Yoginitantra *edited by B.
Shastri:

Prakashan, 1982.

I have a low-resolution photocopy of this text but I need of a
high-resolution copy.

I am also looking for

Biernacki, L. 2013. 'The Yogin? and the Tantric Sex Rite, or How to Keep a
Secret.' In *Yogin? in South Asia: Interdisciplinary Approaches*, edited by
I. Keul. Routledge.

I hope someone can help me.
