[INDOLOGY] Pdf request
Dear indologists,
May someone can help me. I need to translate from Italian to English a
block-quote belonging to a sub-chapter of
Doniger (O?Flaherty), Wendy. 1973. *Asceticism and Eroticism in the
Mythology of ?iva*. London/New York/Toronto: Oxford University Press.
(or of any other English edition, some of whom are entitled, *?iva: The
Erotic Ascetic*)
More specifically, I need of the sub-chapter, of chapter 5 (?iva and Kama),
entitled
*G: Kama reborn as a tree---Rebirth from fire*
Best wishes,
Paolo
