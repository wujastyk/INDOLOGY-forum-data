[INDOLOGY] A distraction from the Coronavirus
??????? ??????? ?? ???? ?????? ??? ??? ?
???????????????? ?? ???????????? ???????? ?
The child which is playing with flowers and with whom the wind is 
playing in the forest,
she is Shakuntala, innocent in regard to Corona and the like and 
untouched by common life.
In order to avoid verbal forms that are not sanctioned by Panini, I have 
revised yesterday's verse:
d?r?k?t?? sam?j?t sv?? patn?? d???v? sa socati /
tasy?s tu m?gasa?sarga? prek?ya r?mo hi tu?yati //
Thanks to Madhav Deshpande for his note on Panini sent off-list.
