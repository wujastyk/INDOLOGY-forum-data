Subject: [INDOLOGY] aluk-compounds
Message-ID: <b8d6c159-b6b5-abd1-f9a5-e325e099d87b@gmail.com>

Dear fellow list members,

does anybody happen to know of (an) example(s) from Sanskrit literature 
(preferably Vedic or Epic) in which a genitival /aluk/-compound is used 
as an insult? I mean in partcular the type of /aluk/-compounds whose 
usage is described and licensed by P??. 6.3.21 and 6.3.22.

Hints to secondary literature on cursing and swear words in Ancient 
India or on the aforementioned S?tras (and maybe also Details on the 
P??inian treatment of /aluk/-compound in general) would of course be 
highly appreciated as well.

Thanks in advance

Tim
