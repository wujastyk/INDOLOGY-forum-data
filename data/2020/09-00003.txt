[INDOLOGY] Random Weekend Scrapbook Request: WSC 10, 1997, in Bangalore
Hi, John, I do remember the interview, now that you mention it.  I was
hustled over to a journalist with zero notice :-)
I don't have any record of any of that, I'm afraid.  However, the
Taralabalu Kendra might have something in their files.  Shivamurti Swamiji
<https://www.google.com/search?q=shivamurthy+swamiji>, who hosted the WSC,
is still the head of that place and he is available by email.
Best,
Dominik
