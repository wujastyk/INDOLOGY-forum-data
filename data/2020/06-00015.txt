[INDOLOGY] Tikasarvasva kanda 2 varga 1-3
Respected scholars,
If anyone of you is aware about a PDF scan of the following work, or is
willing to scan it afresh for me, I would appreciate it.
Trivandrum Sanskrit Series XLIII
Amarakosha with Amarakoshodghatana and Tikasarvasva.
I am aware about the following archive.org file, but it is not amenable to
OCRing.
A separate scan if any exists would be helpful.
