Madhav,
Does the switch from -Bhatta to -Panta represent the bestowal of some sort of title or mark of distinction?

In an old letter of my father, he lists our genealogy from the 16th or 17th century. Here are some interesting details:Our known genealogy from 16th or 17th century:
Lukambhatta>Avajipanta>Vitthalapanta>Balajipanta>Gobajipanta>Abajipanta>Balajipanta>Sakopanta>Appajipanta>Sakopanta>Krishnapanta>Sakharampanta [wife: Bakula]>Ramchandrapanta [wife: Janaki]>Vasudevpanta [wife: Lakshmi]>Murlidhar Panta [wife: Mandakini]>Madhav [wife: Shubhangi]
My father had recovered this long genealogy from some old land ownership documents.? The land was originally granted to Lukambhatta [probably in the 16th of 17th century] and was handed down to the eldest son till my great-grand-father, and then it was sold.? There is a funny story told about Lukambhatta.? He was a Jyotishi "astrologer" at the court of some local ruler and it was his job to tell the king what Tithi it was on a given day.? One day he made a mistake and told the ruler that it was a full moon night (Paurnima), when actually it was a no moon night (Amavasya).? That obviously created a big problem.? But Lukambhatta told the king that he was such an ardent devotee of some divinity that the king will indeed see the moon in the sky that night.? Evidently the king saw the moon on an Amavasya night, and was pleased with Lukambhatta and granted him the land that came all the way down to my great-grand-father.??A magical story indeed.
My Sanskrit version of this genealogy:
