[INDOLOGY] Overseas students and online teaching (US)
The new ICE regulation is aimed at schools that will be entirely online with no in-class instruction.
?1. Nonimmigrant F-1 and M-1 students attending schools operating entirely online may not take a full online course load and remain in the United States.?
?3. Nonimmigrant F-1 students attending schools adopting a hybrid model?that is, a mixture of online and in person classes?will be allowed to take more than one class or three credit hours online. These schools must certify to SEVP, through the Form I-20, ?Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status,? certifying that the program is not entirely online, that the student is not taking an entirely online course load this semester, and that the student is taking the minimum number of online classes required to make normal progress in their degree program. The above exemptions do not apply to F-1 students in English language training programs or M-1 students pursing vocational degrees, who are not permitted to enroll in any online courses.?
A list of what 800+ schools are currently planning for the Fall is compiled and avaiable on the Chronicle of Higher Education website. https://www.chronicle.com/article/Here-s-a-List-of-Colleges-/248626?cid=cp275 <https://www.chronicle.com/article/Here-s-a-List-of-Colleges-/248626?cid=cp275> (click the arrow to move to the next page - the list, not the top text, changes). Schools that plan to go completely online include the Cal State schools, but most schools seem to be considering a hybrid semester or quarter.
