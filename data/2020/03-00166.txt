[INDOLOGY] The study of Sanskrit as the epitome of uselessness
Regarding:  Introductory Suggestions:
Quit now before it's too late!
Almost the same quote in the same location is given in Felix Otter's
Grundkurs Sanskrit, p. ix:
,,Give up now before it's too late.''
Handschriftlicher Zusatz eines anonymen Vor-
besitzers unter der ?berschrift ,,Introductory
Suggestions'' in einem antiquarisch erworbenen
Exemplar von C.R. Lanmans Sanskrit Reader.
Could this be the very same book or is it a coincidence?
All the Best,
Victor
