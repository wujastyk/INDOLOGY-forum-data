[INDOLOGY] Manusmriti ... (Olivelle, J P)
Dear Tylor W., 
Thank you for your posting.
Thol. Thirumavalavan and other members of his party are my good friends. In fact, Thol. Thirumavalavan & the secretary of his party published one my books (albeit small in size). If I need any clarification about anything political, I can ask them directly. So, no worries. Thank you!.
I?d like to stop participating in this thread with this posting.
