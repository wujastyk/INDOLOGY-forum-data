=?utf-8?Q?[INDOLOGY]_Edgerton's_Pa=C3=B1catantra?=
Dear all,
Does anyone happen to have a scan of Edgerton's Panchatantra Reconstructed?
I have one already (here
<https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RAUY8EMkieyTgqJoevQOnfRenimC2sK2/view?usp=sharing>),
but the resolution, especially in the apparatus, could be improved.
Many Thanks,
Victor
