Dear Chris
I cannot answer your question, but perhaps better to ask at the H-Buddhism
list. However, I can say that to my (of course incomplete) knowledge, *sokushin
j?butsu* does not mean/have anything to do with self-starvation or
mummification, but means becoming a buddha in this very body (rather than
after death). Perhaps it is held that some practices lead to this, but I
would be surprised if the term were used for the practices themselves.
