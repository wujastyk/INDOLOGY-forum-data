[INDOLOGY] Nyay philosophy
Dear Dr Das,
As per my understanding, it is Akshapada/Gautama (Ak?ap?da/Gautama in
IAST, ???????/????
in Devanagari) from 1st/2nd century CE, who wrote the Nyaya-sutras and
considered as the founder of the Nyaya school of Philosophy. Even I have
heard the traditional scholars uses the name Gautama.
Many eminent scholars like Karl H Potter

and JN Mohanty
<https://www.britannica.com/topic/Indian-philosophy/The-logical-period#ref238718>
and
others used *Gautama* in their respective texts. I have seen Satish Chandra
Vidyabhushana
<https://archive.org/stream/NyayaSutra/nyaya_sutras_of_gautama#page/n1/mode/2up>
using the name '*Gotama*' in one of his texts.
Hope this clarifies the confusion.
Thank you.
