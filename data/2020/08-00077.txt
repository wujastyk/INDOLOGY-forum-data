Dear colleagues,

I just received news that the 27th Gonda lecture, *The Mah?bh?rata: The
Epic of the Greater Good* by James Fitzgerald, has been published on the
website of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW):
https://knaw.nl/shared/resources/actueel/publicaties/pdf/2020-gonda_lecture_no27-fitzgerald-web

You can also view and download PDFs of Gonda lectures from previous years
there:
