Dear Colleagues,
I should like to bring another new publication to your attention.
Kindly regarding,
Walter Slaje
Boll?e, Willem: Alphabetic Contents of B??a?s K?dambar?: Based on Gwendolyn
Layne?s and David Smith's Translations (= Studia Indologica Universitatis
Halensis, Band 17). Halle an der Saale: Universit?tsverlag
Halle-Wittenberg, 2020, 168 S., ISBN: 978-3-86977-221-9, EAN: 9783869772219
In the words of David Smith, ?there is no Sanskrit poet more interesting
than B??a, none more original, none greater, and his prose poem ?Princess
K?dambar?? is his supreme achieve?ment. Always held in India to be the best
prose poem, B??a?s K?dambar? is a master?piece of classical Sanskrit
litera?ture, unrivaled in rich?ness and depth.
The late Professor Willem Boll?e (1927?2020) has prepared an index of words
and notions of B??a?s difficult and unique romance K?dambar? with a view to
unclosing the wealth of cultural infor?mation contained in this second work
of genius of B??a. Professor Boll?e has released the present edition for
printing. It is the last mono?graph from his untiring pen.
