The pattern here is
III UIU UIU IU
If you change the first two laghus into a guru , it turns into
UI UIU UIU IU
which can also be written as
UIU IU UIU IU
There is a repetition of  UIU IU
or there are two symmetrical halves  UIU IU and  UIU IU
UIU IU UIU IU is ???????
We can say that by replacing the initial guru of  ???????  with two laghus
, we get ???????? .  This makes  ???????  and ???????? have the same
singing pattern.
First UIU IU  in ????? ascending tone and second UIU IU in ??????
descending tone. / ????? ??? - ????? ???  \
In  ????????,  III UIU UIU IU is the same as  IIIU IU UIU IU and the
singing is IIIU IU   in ????? ascending tone and  UIU IU in ??????
descending tone.
 / ??? ?????  - ????? ???  \  or  / ????? ???  - ????? ???  \
We have many such pairs.
??????????????????? changes into  ?????????????????? by replacing the
initial guru of  ???????????????????   with two laghus , we get
?????????????????? . That is the reason why viraamasthaana shifts one
number from  ??????????????????? to  ????????????????? .  Reason is the
singing style and singing pattern.
That is the reason why in Telugu Satakams , they consider  inclusion of
??????????????????? and  ????????????????? both in the same s'atakam as no
violation of uniformity of meter. Reason is the uniformity in singing style
and singing pattern.
Same with ????????? and ???????? in Telugu. Replacing the initial guru of
????????? with two laghus changes it into  ???????? . Here too,
viraamasthaana of champakamaalaa is one number higher than that of
utpalamaalaa.
That is the reason Gopee geetam is called geetam.
