To me, it is clear that there is no direct link between the Sanskrit
instrumental -ena and Modern Marathi forms like ??????.  Old Marathi has
?????, and at some point -?? in singular and -?? in plural emerge.  It is
unlikely that Marathi would be reverting directly to Sanskrit in this late
phase.  The old Marathi inscription has ??????????? ???????, where Modern
Marathi would have ???????????? ??????.  G. V. Tulpule in his ?????????
????? ???? provides many forms that have a similar ending, i.e ????????,
????????, ??????? etc. and the plural forms like ??????, ???????,
?????????? etc.  The endings that appear in Modern Marathi are not there in
the Marathi of the Yadava period.  But ??????????? has a few forms like
???? and ???? and ????????, indicating that the endings ??/?? do exist at
least marginally in Old Marathi.  Some have connected this to the influence
of Kannada in the neighborhood.  However, the endings -??/?? are to be seen
in the Marathi of the Peshwa period and then they continue into Modern
Marathi.
