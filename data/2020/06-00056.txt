[INDOLOGY] pdf requests
Dear All
A number of you wrote to say that you would also like copies of these.  So
far the only one of the four that has turned up is
author    = {Pappu, S. S. Rama Rao},
publisher = {Chanakya Publications},
title     = {The Dimensions of Karma},
year      = {1987}
It is available here
https://archive.org/details/dimensionsofkarm0000unse
for (digital) borrowing.
Thanks to Elliot Stern and Harunaga Isaacson for pointing this out.
Yours Alex
