[INDOLOGY] Retroflexion and gender in viruses
Very stimulating discussion, John.  By the way, the ???????????? is a
so-called ???????, and Patanjali includes the expression ????? in this
Ga?a.  In any case, my point is that there are exceptions to rules in
P??ini, and this becomes an issue with loan vocabulary.  A good example
that comes to my mind is the Marathi name ???????, the mother of king
Shivaji.  In Sanskrit dramas and epics written on Shivaji's life in the
last few centuries, she is represented by words like ????????.  However,
when it comes to pronunciation, the Marathi word ???? is not like Sanskrit
?.  While ? in ?? is palatal like Sanskrit, ? in ?? is an alveolar.  In
Sanskrit renderings that I have heard in Pune, the Marathi distinction is
retained, because her identity is otherwise lost at least to Marathi
listeners.
