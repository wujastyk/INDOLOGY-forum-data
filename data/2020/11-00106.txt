[INDOLOGY] Text request: Nagarjuna's Ratnavali (Devanagari script)
On behalf of a student, I was wondering if any of you might have a PDF of
the Sanskrit edition of N?g?rjuna's Ratn?val? published in Varanasi by
Bharatiya Vidya Samsthana in 2003, edited by Avadhe?a Kum?ra Caube:
Ratn?val? / ?ryan?g?rjuna viracit? ; s?nvaya "Vimal?" Hind?vy?khy?sahit? ;
samp?daka? vy?khy?k?ra?ca Avadhe?a Kum?ra Caube.
If it is not available electronically, perhaps someone knows where I could
order a physical copy?
I am aware of the Indica et Tibetica Verlag 1982 edition of this work from
Michael Hahn, but if I am not mistaken that edition was published in Latin
script. My student requires the text in Devanagari.
Thanks very much!
Andrew
