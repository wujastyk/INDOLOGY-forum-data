[INDOLOGY] Translations
Dear Patrick,
Marathi renderings of Bhart?hari?s three ?atakas and Jagann?tha's Ga?g?lahar? are attributed to the seventeenth-century poet V?mana Pa??it. There?s some debate among scholars of Marathi literature as to whether there were two V?manas, but either way, those texts were adapted into Marathi in the seventeenth century. The question of what constitutes a translation is worth asking in this case, as these 'translations? are refracted through V?mana?s unique understanding of bhakti and Advaita Ved?nta.
Best wishes,
