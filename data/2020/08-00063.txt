I am puzzled by a curious feature of Sanskrit versification, syntax and
sandhis.  While sandhis are supposed to take place between p?das 1 and 2,
and between 3 and 4, the enclitic forms such as ?? and ??, as they come
under the P??inian restriction of ??????? cannot occur at the beginning of
any p?das.  I am looking for any serious discussion or research on these
features, and whether forms like ?? and ?? do occur at the beginning of
p?das 2 and 4 in known Vedic or post-Vedic literature.  I will appreciate
any help you can provide.  With best wishes,
