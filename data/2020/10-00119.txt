It looks like Skt. nilaya is a borrowing from Dravidian.

A Concise Etymological Dictionary of 1956 by Manfred Mayrhofer gives a Dravidian origin for Skt. Malaya.
The same process that operated in the formation of Skt. malaya seems to have operated in the case of Skt. nilaya (< Dr. *nil-.)
How did Manfred Mayrhofer explain Skt. nilaya in his later etymological dictionary?
Thank you in advance.
