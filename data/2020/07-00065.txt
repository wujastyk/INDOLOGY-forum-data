[INDOLOGY] Scholarship on Kinnar/Hijra
Dear Sri Sravana-ji,
Usage of the word Kinnara in connection with Hijras and other non-binary
gender aspects seems to be new and recent.
Do you or other list members have studies  or references establishing
otherwise, i.e., showing usage of the word Kinnara in connection with
Hijras or related gender aspects ?
