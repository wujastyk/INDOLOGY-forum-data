Dear Friends
My friend Charles Ramble is working on a Tibetan text on poison. It
mentions for instance 32 types. I am aware that (no doubt among others)
*Su?rutasa?hit?* in its Kalpasth?na has much to say about poison, but
understandably, not how to make it. There seems to exist a term *vi?a??stra*,
but more I have not been able to discover. I feel I may have overlooked
something rather well known.
I would be delighted both to learn more myself (no, I'm not looking to
poison anyone!) and to pass along the information to Charles.

Very best,
Jonathan
