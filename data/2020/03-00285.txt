[INDOLOGY] Best English translation and notes for Astadhyayi and Siddhanta Kaumudi
Dear all
I have never used any English books to learn Astadhyayi sutras. One of my
friends who is comfortable with English wants to know the best book. Google
search shows two to three editions. But to buy a hard copy I must be
specific to him. Please suggest.
Thank you.
