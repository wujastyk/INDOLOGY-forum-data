[INDOLOGY] List of texts published in the journal The Pandit
Dear List Members,
Does anyone have a list of Sanskrit texts published around a century ago in
the journal The Pandit.
This was perhaps discussed earlier on this list but I could not find it in
the List Archive: too many hits for "pandit"...
With best regards,
Jan
