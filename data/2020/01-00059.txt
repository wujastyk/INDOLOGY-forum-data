[INDOLOGY] Has all went well?
Dear Rosane,
A small message as I thought of you today, as i?ve struggled to get to the train station and fine a running train that would bring me to where I am now for a couple of day, in Mainz.
Have you well reached Munich? Is you?re colleague and friend faring well enough?
with all my best
