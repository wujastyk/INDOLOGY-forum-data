Dear Rosane,

A small message as I thought of you today, as i?ve struggled to get to the train station and fine a running train that would bring me to where I am now for a couple of day, in Mainz.


Have you well reached Munich? Is you?re colleague and friend faring well enough?


with all my best

Agathe
