Subject: [INDOLOGY] Kumarila Bhatta's Mimamsaslokavarttika?
Message-ID: <E5F571B94D36DB4AA048E0CF279CFC700142C29331@tabvmexdag1mb03.tufts.ad.tufts.edu>

Dear All,
I was hoping someone out there could point me to some online or PDF edition of the Mimamsaslokavarttika. I am aware of portions of it that are on GRETIL, but I actually need the whole thing. Like many of you out there, this virus has left me suddenly housebound without a chance to get the materials I needed to teach the remainder of the semester from home.
Be well,

-j
