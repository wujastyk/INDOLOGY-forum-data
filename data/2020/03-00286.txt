[INDOLOGY] Kumarila Bhatta's Mimamsaslokavarttika?
Dear All,
I was hoping someone out there could point me to some online or PDF edition of the Mimamsaslokavarttika. I am aware of portions of it that are on GRETIL, but I actually need the whole thing. Like many of you out there, this virus has left me suddenly housebound without a chance to get the materials I needed to teach the remainder of the semester from home.
Be well,
-j
