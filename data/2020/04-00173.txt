[INDOLOGY] CORRECTION: Help needed translating tantric verse
Dear Harry,
Please read the whole Chapter 16 ?Astronomy, Time-Reckoning, and Cosmology? of my book ?The Roots of Hinduism? (OUP 2015) for evidence on the basis of which I suggest that the basic ideas of the Ku??alin?-yoga and the tortoise as representing the setting/night sun (and the yogi restraining his senses) go back to the Indus Civilization.
With best wishes,  Asko Parpola
