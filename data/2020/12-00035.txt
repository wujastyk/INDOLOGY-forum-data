Dear list,

I am looking for manuscripts of, and publications about, the Ca?gav?tti (or
Sambandhodde?a or Sambandhopade?a), by Ca?gad?sa. I would be very grateful
if any list member can help me to obtain scans. I am also interested in the
Tibetan version of the text.

Many thanks and best wishes,
Aleix
