Subject: [INDOLOGY] Is this hymn title in sanskrit?
Message-ID: <CAJ3b0o_XzPXc+FqvPrgyL2x92Jayu9Evq5UQn=QZ7nQTT5WEvA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list members,

I'm looking at a hymn whose title is *mah?lak?my? ?rtikyam but I can't
find *?rtikya in any of the sanskrit dictionaries.  Can someone confirm
that  ?rtikyam is in sanskrit and written correctly.
Thanks,
Harry Spier
