Dear colleagues,

Might any of you be able to put me in the way of a scan of this article?

R. Gnoli, 1958 (ed.): ?The Bhagavadbhaktistotra by Avadh?tasiddha?, East and West 9, 1?2 (n.s.): ?Miscellanea Indica?, 1:215?222.

What with Christmas travelling and awkward library timings, I shan't be able to see it until after a publishing deadline...

Yours, with best wishes,
Dominic
