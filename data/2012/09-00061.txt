This inscription is no. 3 (pp. 5-16) in Mirashi's book (which Richard
Salomon referred to). He accepts B?hler's dating. Mirashi rejects the
argument that Suresh Kolichala referred to (about the N??egh?? inscription
being paleographically later than the Besnagar pillar inscription of
Heliodorus) on p. 5 of part I ("Palaeographic evidence is not quite
reliable when the distance in time is not large").
I happen to have Ajay Mitra Shastri's "Age of the S?tav?hanas" here, and in
his article (p. 24-25) he suggests that the N??egh?? inscription was put up
by Vedi?r? during or after the reign of his father S?takar?i I (whom
Shastri dates to 12BC-AD44).
