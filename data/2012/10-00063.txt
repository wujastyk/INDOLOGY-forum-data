Dear List,

We are actively working on a memorial volume dedicated to Frits Staal,
and many have already committed to contributing articles on his work
and his life.  We encourage others to do so as well.  We encourage all
Indologists who have known Frits or who have been influenced by him to
contribute to this volume, whether or not you are Vedicicts.  We want
to accomplish two things in this project:

1.  to celebrate his enormous contributions to early Vedic Studies, and

2.  to give a rudimentary biography of this prolific Vedic scholar.

However, contributions are not confined to Vedic Studies.  Frits'
interest in India was wide and deep.   All Indologists should feel
free and welcome to contribute their thoughts and memories, as we
witnessed earlier this year when news of Frits' passing first
circulated among us some six months ago.

If you have any questions, please post them to me, editor of this
volume, or Richard Payne, who has generously offered to publish this
publication: his email address is:
