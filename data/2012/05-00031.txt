they will receive some books).  From various email chains, I understand
that those sending money from outside India should send it to:
THE KUPPUSWAMI SASTRI RESEARCH INSTITUTE.
Union Bank of India,
Mylapore Branch
Account No. 395702010007408
NEFT NO: UBIN0539571
IFSC CODE NO.600026009
But please do check with the institute first.
Best,
