Dear
Francois Voegeli, dear members of the list,
?
Colleagues have
forwarded your request to me and I allow myself to use the list access of my
wife for a reply and a related request of mine.
?
Unfortunately,
there is very little material available on Aghor?s in Nepal. I am only aware of
some scattered notions, e.g. Axel Michaels (?Der Hinduismus?, Munich: Beck,
1998) mentions the Aghor? ascetic Pagal?nanda who lived at the cremation ground
close to the Pa?upatin?th temple in Deopatan. For Northern India, though, the
situation is different:while in the
accounts of the colonial administration the Aghor?s are stereotypically depicted
as a public nuisance (cp. Balfour
1897, Barrow 1893, Crooke 1896, 1908), more recent research aimed at drawing a
more differentiated picture. (American) Social Anthropologists worked mainly in
Banaras on the tradition of B?b? K?n?r?m Aghor? and its social reforms under Avadh?t
Bhagv?n R?m (which ? at least from hearsay ? had an impact on some Nepalese
Aghor?s too). See e.g.
?
Jonathan P.
Parry. ??The Aghori Ascetics of Benares?
In: Burghard, R. et al. (ed.): Indian
Religion. London, 51-78, 1985.

Roxanne
Gupta. The Politics of Heterodoxy and the Kinarami Ascetics of Banaras (unpubl.
PhD diss., Syracuse University, 1993)
-?The K?n?
R?m?. Augha?s and Kings in the Age of Cultural Contact?. In: Lorenzen, David N.
(ed.) Bhakti Religion in Northern India.
Albany, 133-142.
Ron
Barrett. Aghor Medicine. Pollution,
Death, and Healing in Northern India. Berkeley, 2008. 
?
The works mentioned
focus on different aspects of the Aghor tradition in its modern social context
and contain only little information about the history of the movement or its
literature. Both still deserve to be properly studied. Some more details on K?n?r?m
(and other Aghor? or Augha? of his or of related traditions) and his literary
work can be gathered from Indian publications, for example, Dharmendra
Brahmac?r? ??str?s Santmat k? Sarbha?g-Samprad?y (Pa?n?, 1953). Last but not least, over the last
decades the K?n?r?m?s themselves have been publishing many pamphlets and books
about their tradition. 
?
In case you
read German, I could send you my unpublished MA paper ?Die Domestizierung der
Aghor?s: K?n?r?m und G?t?val?? (Univ. Leipzig, 2004), which deals with the
historical background of the Aghor?s and the hagiographical accounts on K?n?r?m
and contains a tentative translation of the G?t?val?, one of the collections of
poems said to be composed by K?n?r?m.
?
Since I recently
started working on a paper about aghor ritual (or, more precisely, on ?ritual denial? taking the K?n?r?m? as an
example), may I add a question to the list members on my own behalf? To my
knowledge, not much has been done on the tantric texts related to aghoras?dhan?, which is only rarely
referred to by the K?n?r?m?s themselves (an exception is R?mdul?r Si?ha et al.
(ed.): Aghora granth?vali?. Collected Works of Aghora Manuscripts.
Varanasi, 1986). As I did not touch the topic
for several years I might not be up to date. So if someone could provide
further information on the tantric tradition on aghora I would be very thankful.
?
Best
regards

Dear Patrick, Dear Members of the list,
I would appreciate locating that reference too. During a recent fieldtrip to Nepal, we met in Devghat a very interesting member of this community. The chief of our expedition has been doing some fieldwork with the aghoris for some time, and this meeting will probably be mentioned in our report.?
The personality of this aghori very much impressed me, and I became interested in this community I heard of, but never met closely. Any information on them would then be welcomed.

I would also like to take this opportunity to thank all the people on this list who answered my question posted some time ago on p(a)uNDarIka (Mr/Dr/Prof. Eltschinger, Houben, Gengnagel, Salomon, Goldman). Actually, this question stemmed from a project I am pursuing in Lausanne, and which is starting to give some interesting results on the history of Vedic Ritual. I will post them on a website asap and advise the community. Thanks again.

F. Voegeli
