Dear list members,

I got hold of two books from our library: Kirfel's Die Kosmographie  
der Inder, and Billard's L'Astronomie Indienne, and found many of the  
pages uncut and stuck together. Before I "dissect" the books, may I  
check if someone could share a pdf copy, on-list or off-list.

Many thanks,

Bill M. Mak
