Subject: Video on vedic sacrifice and Kane's work in pdf ?
Message-ID: <161227095264.23782.129280561365022087.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear all, 

For teaching purpose, I am looking for a short pedagogical video (30mn to 1 hour) for a course on Vedic sacrifice. I was thinking of taking cuts from F. Staal's great video, but would you suggest anything else ? 
For research purpose, I wonder if anyone had a pdf version of Kane monumental work on dharmasastra ? 

I would be very grateful to anyone who could help in these two matters. 

Best regards,

Rapha?l Voix.
