Video on vedic sacrifice and Kane's work in pdf ?
Dear all, 
For teaching purpose, I am looking for a short pedagogical video (30mn to 1 hour) for a course on Vedic sacrifice. I was thinking of taking cuts from F. Staal's great video, but would you suggest anything else ? 
For research purpose, I wonder if anyone had a pdf version of Kane monumental work on dharmasastra ? 
I would be very grateful to anyone who could help in these two matters. 
Best regards,
