Dear Ryan,
I checked Bandurski?s 1994 catalog of the G?ttingen collection of
S??k?ty?yana?s photographs, and although it contains several of
Ratn?kara??nti?s works, this title is not among them. Could it be
listed under an alternative title? I sent you Bandurski?s indices
in separate email; the whole catalog can be had here:
   http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/record=b15929794~S1
in the Berkeley library.
All best,
