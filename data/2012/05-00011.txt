The University of Helsinki is among the leading multidisciplinary  
research universities in the world. In addition to its 11 faculties,  
the University includes several independent institutes, some of which  
are jointly operated with other universities. Some 36,500 students are  
currently pursuing an undergraduate or postgraduate degree at the  
University of Helsinki.
The University of Helsinki offers a
TENURE TRACK
for teaching and research personnel, intended to increase the  
predictability, competitiveness and attractiveness of academic careers  
while promoting internationalisation at the University.
The University employs talented, motivated academics who have  
completed their doctoral degree within the last ten years and have  
since accrued academic and other relevant qualifications. Successful  
applicants will be employed as assistant professors. The duration of  
the first employment contract will be three to five years, depending  
on the appointee?s background and experience. If the appointee  
produces successful work which fulfils pre-determined criteria,  
employment may be continued with a second fixed-term contract, after  
which the appointee may receive a permanent position as professor. The  
Rector?s decision on the establishment of the tenure track system  
(Decision No. 2012/39) can be found at  
http://www.helsinki.fi/recruitment/tenuretrack.html.
The academic qualifications and teaching experience of applicants will  
be considered when making the selection. Additional merit will be  
granted for international and interdisciplinary experience as well as  
experience in acquiring research funding.
The Faculty of Arts is announcing one open tenure-track position in
SOUTH ASIAN STUDIES

studies, South Asian studies and Indo-European studies.

she may also acquire teaching merits and qualify as a teacher by  
completing studies in university pedagogy. The Department will promote  
the appointee?s international networking and publishing in
