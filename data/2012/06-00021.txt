non-western philosophy as NOT philosophy
David,
The idea that philosophy is a distinctively, even exclusively,  
European phenomenon finds systematic expression in the continental  
tradition (as Victoria Lysenko notes in her fine lecture): Hegel,  
Husserl, Heidegger, in particular. (Nietzsche was a special case.)  
Wilhelm Halbfass offers insightful and nuanced discussions of their  
views in "India and Europe," Part I. I think one of the best "proof  
texts" for this position is Husserl's "Vienna Lecture" (1935),  
contained as an appendix in "The Crisis of European Sciencs and  
Transcendental Phenomenology." (Perhaps Matthew Kapstein and Jonardon  
Ganeri mention this text as well; at the moment I am not where I can  
check.) It makes for interesting reading, especially when read  
together with the "Crisis"; certainly, it is not complete nonsense.  
The strength of Halbfass' work is that he is both critical of this  
tendency and determined to understand it. The disparaging of Asian  
thought in the analytic tradition is more anecdotal, and usually takes  
the form of complaining that Asian philosophy is lacking in worthwhile  
arguments, i.e., arguments that can be employed in solving problems in  
contemporary analytic philosophy. B. K. Matilal (the pioneer) and now  
many others have tried to dispell this impression, but I think with  
mixed results.
Yours truly,
