SARIT and a new e-Mahabharata
Dear colleagues,
Thanks to Dr.Dominik Wujastyk and his team for the support in distributing this e-text through SARIT. 
I would like to share the credit of creating this entire e-text of the Mahabharata edition with my team members that supported my work. Starting from my work in Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha, Tirupati, I continued this work with the support of my research team members in various places - Hyd and Bangalore, the result of which I wanted to share with the scholarly community. I thank one and all who made this possible. My thanks are due to Professor KV Ramakrishnamacharyulu, Amba Kulakarni, Prof. Prahladachar, Members of MSP Bangalore and many others. 
Please improve this version and use. In case any error is found, please let us, which will be helpful in bringing better version.
warm regards,
shrivarakhedi
