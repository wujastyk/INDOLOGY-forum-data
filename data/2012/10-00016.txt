Effects of Title VI cuts in US Area Studies
Hello Tim,
     Sanskrit has never been funded through the federal title VI money,
since it was restricted to modern languages only.  For the sake of the
modern languages of South Asia, we are all concerned about these cuts, and
hope that the Congress will reinstate the money.  But given the political
situation in the US Congress, I am very pessimistic.  Hope I am wrong.
