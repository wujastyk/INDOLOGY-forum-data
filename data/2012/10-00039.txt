INDIAN MUSIC AND THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE: A REVIEW ESSAY
by Harold S. Powers


Source: Ethnomusicology, Vol. 9, No. 1 (Jan., 1965), pp. 1-12

Published by: University of Illinois Press on behalf of Society for 
Ethnomusicology

Stable URL: http://www.jstor.org/stable/850413 .

On p.2, he writes:

[...] In all indological fields the English language has made possible 
an exceptionally close and extensive cooperation between Indian and 
European scholars. But in most subjects the nature of the material is 
reasonably objective, and can be known to a greater or lesser extent by 
anyone, however different may be the approaches to its interpretation. 
Art works, language, social behavior, even religious
belief, are subjects whose data are either directly accessible or 
indirectly accessible through language. Music, however, as well as 
dance, is a nonverbal art in a primarily temporal medium; it presents 
enormous difficulties of scholarly analysis and description even to 
those intimately acquainted with it as a living art. Thus, the 
development of the literature on Indian music in the English
language is an especially valuable illustration of inter-cultural 
contact. [....]


This and many other passages in his article could apply to the subject 
we are discussing, in which a critical mass of information universally 
accessible has not yet been reached.

Best wishes
