Vishnu on the banks of the Volga river
Several things are odd about this. 
Why would someone get sent to Siberia because he "...was suddenly found to have stolen over 500,000 paper clips from work over the course of his tenure at Odessa University"?
What is "contracted poloniumitis of the nose"? (The only google references are to variants of this story.)
Why is a 6th-10th century statue of Vishnu relevant for Russian -- or Indian -- (pre)history?
If Staraya Maina was so important in the history of Russia, why does its name not appear in a (pre)historic or archaeological context on web pages other than the ones reporting this story?
Why is there no discussion of the other finds (coins, etc.)?
What happened to the promised follow-up conference? (This was 5 years ago--plenty of time for some follow-up work, whether at a conference or elsewhere.)
If you check many of the web pages that report the story, you can find plenty of questions being raised. Why does the story keep reappearing without addressing any of these questions?
Cheers,
Hans Henrich Hock
