Lost verse: 'Submerged in the sea of              sa=?utf-8?Q?=E1=B9=81_s=C4=81ra'?=
Dear colleagues
This verse was recited in kath? performance in Mumbai in 2009:
sa?s?ra-s?gare magna? d?na? m?? karu?anidhe
karma-moha-g?h?t??ga? m?m uddhara bhav?r?v?t
It was said to be from the Bh?gavatapur??a, but I have been unable to locate it in that work. I am wondering if any scholar recognises it from another source, or is it perhaps part of an oral tradition.
Thanks in advance
