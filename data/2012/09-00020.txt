Subject: Oldest RV manuscript?
Message-ID: <161227097220.23782.11782637476661604606.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

dear Colleagues,

I was asked one of those questions which I think I *should* have been able
to answer by myself, but --am I just being lazy?-- it seems more reliable
and quicker to ask the ?i??as:

What is the oldest RV MS? I'm guessing (!) that it should be in ?arada, and
I know that the oldest one in Pune is supposed to date to the 15th c. but I
doubt that it just happens to be the oldest overall.

Thanks in advance!  jonathan
