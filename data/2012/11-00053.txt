Thanks Hans and Dipak for the clarification. Now I understand why Witzel
referred to *m/bru?a* without any explanation: splitting of sonorant
clusters by an insertion of a homorganic voiced stop is a well-known
phenomenon in Indo-European.

I also looked at Witzel's references to von Hin?ber 1980 (in German) and
1989, but I still do not see where the ancient self-designation of the
Burusho- people as *m**ru?a *is attested. I appreciate any help in tracing
the attestation of *mru?**a*.

Thanks,
Suresh.
