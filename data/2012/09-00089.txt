Livestream today : Emptiness and Buddhist Ethics
Emptiness and Buddhist Ethics: A cross-cultural symposium
September 27-28, 2012
www.ethicsandemptiness.com
'Emptiness and Buddhist Ethics' is another name for a gathering of The
Cowherds at Central Michigan University.
The Cowherds are an international group of scholars committed to taking
Buddhism seriously as philosophy. This demands not only explication and
cross-cultural translation, but also reconstruction and criticism. Our
current project explores how Buddhist ethics can work in the context of
teachings on emptiness and no-self.
All sessions are in the Park Library Auditorium at Central Michigan
University
Free & Open to the Public
Watch live & participate online if you cannot make it in person
