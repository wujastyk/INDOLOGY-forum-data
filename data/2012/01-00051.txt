Manuscripts in the Allama Iqbal Library (University of Kashmir,              Srinagar)
The Allama Iqbal Library in the University of Kashmir (Srinagar, Kashmir) digitalized all the available manuscripts in their collection some years back and put all of them online. I do not know how many scholars are already aware of this, so I simply want to bring this online accessible collection to the notice of the scholars who may be interested in Kashmir Studies. Please follow the link below;

The copyright remains with the University of Kashmir. 
Best wishes.
