Subject: Manuscripts in the Allama Iqbal Library (University of Kashmir,              Srinagar)
Message-ID: <161227095032.23782.17540127368904626130.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

The Allama Iqbal Library in the University of Kashmir (Srinagar, Kashmir) digitalized all the available manuscripts in their collection some years back and put all of them online. I do not know how many scholars are already aware of this, so I simply want to bring this online accessible collection to the notice of the scholars who may be interested in Kashmir Studies. Please follow the link below;

The copyright remains with the University of Kashmir. 

Best wishes.
