Dear Colleagues,

In the following paragraph of the job posting distributed on this list  
a few minutes ago, which ran

"Arrangements should be made for three letters of reference, at least  
one of which must comment on the applicant's teaching abilities, to be  
submitted via email to the Chair at historical.studies at utoronto.ca.  
Please include the candidate's name and "Classics Search" in the  
subject line",

the term "Classics Search" should be replaced by "Religion Search".

Please accept my heartfelt apologies for the mistake.

With warm regards,
Christoph Emmrich
