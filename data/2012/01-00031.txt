I don't wish to bore anyone; you've all probably read enough about SOPA and
PIPA recently.  So stop reading now.

But if you are still reading, this talk by Clay Shirky for
TED<http://www.ted.com/talks/defend_our_freedom_to_share_or_why_sopa_is_a_bad_idea.html?utm_source=newsletter_weekly_2012-01-20>is
a nice presentation.  As you listen, bear in mind that everything
Shirky
says applies to academic writing and publication too.

Best,
Dominik
