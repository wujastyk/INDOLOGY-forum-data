Narmada and Narbada
Dear J?rgenji,
Thanks for your response. *Narbada *(??????) and *Narvada *(??????) have
been used as proper names in Central and North India for long.
Come to think of it, the transformation of /m/ > /v/ (actually, /w/) is not
only common in Dravidian, it is found in Middle Indo-Aryan as well. For
example,  intervocalic /m/ getting weakened to a nasalized /?/ can be seen
in: OIA *gr?ma*, 'village' > Pali/Pkt *g?ma *> Ap. *g??a*.
So, now I feel more confident about the derivation of *narbada *from *
narmada *as: **narmada *> *narvada *> *narbada*.
Does anyone have an etymologies for the hydronym *Narmada*? What about the
derivations for the other name of this river: *Rewa*?
Regards,
Suresh.
