Dear Allen,

The boards in Topsfield's "Art of Play" were already published in the 
articles mentioned by me, the difference being that the reproductions in 
the former are better quality and - most importantly - in color. All in 
all, it is a beautiful book.

And yes, I would love to know of any boards in your possession (or 
vicinity). I will make sure to remind you.

All the best,
Jacob

>
>  Dear list,
>
> I am currently conducting a study of traditional Indian Gy?n Caupa?
> (skt. j??napa??a) boards used to play a kind of instructional karmic
> game destined to become the precursor of Snakes and Ladders. I have
> found a number of photographic reproductions of various boards (Jain,
> Vai??ava, ?aivite, Muslim) in the following publications:
>
> * Shimkhada, Deepak (1983) "A Preliminary Study of the Game of Karma
> in India, Nepal, and Tibet" in Artibus Asiae 44:4, p. 308-22.
>
> * Topsfield, Andrew (1985) "The Indian Game of Snakes and Ladders" in
> Artibus Asiae 46:3, pp. 203-26.
>
> * Topsfield, Andrew (2006) "Snakes and Ladders in India: Some Further
> Discoveries" in Artibus Asiae 66:1, pp. 143-79.
>
> A reproduction of a Tibetan board also appears in Mark Tatz and Jody
> Kent's "Rebirth: The Tibetan Game of Liberation" (New York, 1977),
> while a somewhat new-agy recreation of a Vai??ava board is found in
> Harish Johari's "Leela: The Game of Self-Knowledge" (Vermont, 1980).
>
> Several of the boards in the above publications also appear as
> illustrations in more popular books on ancient Indian board games.
>
> Owing to the fragile material (cloth, paper) and relatively careless
> handling of the boards, they are apparently few and far between (the
> oldest known versions dating to the late 18th century). I would
> therefore be very interested in learning about the existence of 
> boards
> (published or not) hidden away or on display in places where I have
> not yet looked.
>
> My present focus is on 72-square Vai??ava boards as they seem to be
> the more numerous and widespread (with 84-square Jain boards running 
> a
> close second), but news of any kind of boards unknown to me would be
> heartily welcomed.
