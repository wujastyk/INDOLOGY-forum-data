Dear Allen,
The boards in Topsfield's "Art of Play" were already published in the 
articles mentioned by me, the difference being that the reproductions in 
the former are better quality and - most importantly - in color. All in 
all, it is a beautiful book.
And yes, I would love to know of any boards in your possession (or 
vicinity). I will make sure to remind you.
All the best,
Jacob
