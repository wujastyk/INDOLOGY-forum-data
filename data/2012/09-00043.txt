Vanessa (et al),

I'd recommend two trilogies that I've used very successfully:

1. Sadhus: India's Holy Men (Films for the Humanities & Sciences, 1995). I
break the trilogy up and use it across three different courses, but they
would certainly work well in a single introductory course.

2. Pleasing God (Harvard Films, 1985) includes three installments: "Loving
Krishna," "Sons of Siva," and "Serpent Mother." The three films are not of
equal quality (Loving Krishna is definitley the best of the lot). But I
like that they are all shot in the same Bengali village, and so give a
snapshot of three different bhakta communities in the same regional and
cultural context.

Cheers,

Beth
