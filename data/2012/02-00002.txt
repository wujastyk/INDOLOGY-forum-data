Terms for Negation ?
Dear Stephen,
just out of interest, which Tibetan terms you are trying to "retrovert"? 
The most common distinction between types of negation in Sanskrit is 
that between prasajyaprati?edha and paryud?sa(prati?edha), usually 
rendered in Tibetan as med dgag or ma yin dgag respectively, but you 
probably refer to some other distinction.
Best regards,
Birgit
