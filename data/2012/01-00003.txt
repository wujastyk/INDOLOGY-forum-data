*SECOND CIRCULAR*


Dear Colleagues,

We are happy to announce that the 11th International Conference on Early
Modern Literatures in North India (ICEMLNI) will be held on August 3rd-5th,
2012 at the Indian Institute of Advanced Study (IIAS), Shimla.  For the
past thirty years, the ICEMNLI has provided a space in which researchers
and scholars of early modern devotional and literary traditions can share
their current research and make connections across languages, regions,
cultures and traditions.

The Conference-- which functions as a workshop for 'research in progress'--
seeks to explore the diverse literary and devotional cultures that existed
simultaneously in North India by re-investigating distinctions and
connections between vernacular and cosmopolitan languages, between the
vernaculars themselves, and between the spheres of devotional and secular
or 'courtly' literatures and practices.  Papers thus span the gamut from
textual criticism to performance and ritual studies, from theology to
poetics, from lost texts to living traditions.

By convening conference at Shimla this year, the ICEMNLI has gained both
the benefit of partnering with the Indian Institute of Advanced Study, and
the greater opportunity for interaction between Indian scholars and their
counterparts abroad.

PARTICIPATION AND CALL FOR PAPERS

We are now inviting individual paper and panel submissions for the 2012
ICEMNLI conference.  Scholars who do not wish to present, but would like to
attend, are also invited and may register
here<http://www.icemlni.org/REGISTRATION05A.html>or through the
website.

PROPOSAL DEADLINE: February 10th, 2012

We are now inviting individual paper and panel submissions for the 2012
ICEMNLI conference.  Although prospective participants are encouraged to
apply as part of a panel, individual papers are most certainly welcome, and
an attempt will be made to group individual papers into appropriate panels.

As the conference was originally conceived as a type of workshop for
research in progress, papers are circulated a few weeks before the
conference and presentations are generally short, leaving the maximum
amount of time for discussion.

(Multimedia presentations are also welcome and appropriate facilities will
be provided; participants are encouraged to mention any equipment
requirements in their proposal.)

PROPOSAL SUBMISSION:
Please submit the attached form, including an abstract of no more than 300
words in MS Word or pdf format.  If applying as part of a panel, please
include the title of the panel in your abstract.  If applying as an
individual, please review the list of tentative panel topics to see if one
or more panels might be an appropriate venue for your paper.

Please email your proposal to: info at icemnli.org

Deadline for proposal submission: February 10th, 2012

Participants will be notified by March 1st, 2012 of their paper's
acceptance and sent additional details on conference registration.

Accommodation and food will be provided by the IIAS at a nominal rate for
the duration of the conference; details about room and board and their cost
will be available soon.  (Participants are also welcome to make their own
arrangements for room and board outside the IIAS if they so choose.)

Registration fees (in Indian rupees):
Regular: Rs. 450
Student: Rs. 300

Participants are responsible for their own travel and other expenses.
