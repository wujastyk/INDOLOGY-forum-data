Terms for Negation ?
The other Jhalk?kar (V?man?c?rya) similarly quotes in the *B?labodhin?*, a
composite commentary on the *K?vyaprak??a*:
"tats?d??ya? tadanyatva? tadalpatva? virodhit? apr??astyam abh?va? ca
na?arth?? ?a?prak?rtit??".
Jhalkikar provides a significant note exemplifying each of the six types of
negation, but like his brother, he does not mention the source of the quote.
I remember searching quite a bit for this quote when I was writing my
dissertation in what I thought were the most likely sources but to no
avail. Perhaps others have had greater success?
