Dear colleagues,
Alex Watson has just asked me to forward this query to the list.  Any leads?
Dominic Goodall
Dear Colleagues
I remember that Tuvia Gelblum, in a talk at SOAS about the Yogas?tras, elaborated the difference between the pursuit of mok?a and the pursuit of siddhis as a difference between a search for 'freedom from' and a search for 'freedom to'.
Has anyone seen someone in print applying this dichotomy between two kinds of freedom to the distinction between mok?a and siddhis?
Yours Alex
