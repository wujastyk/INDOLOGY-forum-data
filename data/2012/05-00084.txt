The emendation you are probably thinking of is:

taj j?n?n?ti by B?htlingk in his edition of the Ch?ndogya.

Subject: [INDOLOGY] query on "tajjalaaniti "saanta upaasiita"

dear all

many years ago I had read a paper by some scholar proposing some emendation in the upanishad sentence
"tajjalaaniti "saanta upaasiita".
I donot remember the exact journal or author now.
please help me to locate the exact author and journal issue. if possible please send the scan or pdf of the same.

I also want to know if anybody has done research on Y and U namams (Tilakas in samskrita) of shrivaishnava groups. I know the study of ashtadashabheda by Suiyave (?) but anything else other?
