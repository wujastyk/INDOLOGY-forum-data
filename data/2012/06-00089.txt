Subject: prenasalized stops in dhivehi
Message-ID: <161227096653.23782.3988877436745932381.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear List,

Could anyone, please, tell how the maldivian prenasalized stops (?g, ?j, ?d,
?b) should be written in the thana script?

Just as combination n + g, j, d; m + b? Or with some special diacritical
mark?

Thanks in advance,

Artur Karp
