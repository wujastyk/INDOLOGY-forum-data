Vishnu on the banks of the Volga river
One may note that many possibilities in respect to
the transmission of Asian iconographical elements to Europe are
explored in the remarkable work _Le Moyen Age Fantastique_
of Jurgis Baltrusaitis. He was primarily concerned, however,
with Gothic art - a somewhat later period than that which
has been the focus of this thread.
