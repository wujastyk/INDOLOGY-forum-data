Subject: New version of the DCS
Message-ID: <161227095622.23782.10281665439094156208.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear colleagues,

a new version of the Digital Corpus of Sanskrit is now available at 
http://kjc-fs-cluster.kjc.uni-heidelberg.de/dcs/index.php

Current version 1.6 contains, among other new features, a public interface 
for discourse semantic annotation (FrameNet), a (hopefully) nicer display 
of query results, and a "Book search" function for scanned Sanskrit books. 

Please refer to 
http://kjc-fs-cluster.kjc.uni-heidelberg.de/dcs/index.php?
contents=help_center
for an overview of added texts and features.

As always, feedback and ideas for improving interface and functionality are 
highly welcome.

Best regards,
Oliver Hellwig
