good book on early Vedic period?
Thank you, Dominik, for correcting me on this.  So perhaps I can
attach a brief review of Staal's book for those list members who might
have an interest in it, but who might not be able to access it? This
attachment is small, but it includes a few other brief book reviews
that I was asked to write at the same time that I wrote the review of
Staal's book.  My online access to these reviews is limited because I
cannot afford to subscribe to the journal where they were published,
but I was able to download these reviews as a bundle.
List members from India and other countries who might not have easy
access to  American and European journals may find it helpful to see
this attachment.
I don't know whether it is legal for me to post files of my own
reviews to this list that are under copyright to others [i.e., the
journals].
I will leave it to Dominik and his co-moderators to stop this email if
I am doing something wrong here.
In any case, I do enthusiastically urge all list members who have not
read Staal's book to read it!
