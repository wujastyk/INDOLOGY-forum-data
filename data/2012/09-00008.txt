a question about 'dalit'
Dear Jonathan,
     While the word dalita as a past participle of the verb dalati is
widely used in the classical literature, the use of this term to refer to
"down-trodden" or lower-caste people is entirely new, no more than 20 or 30
years old, but indeed very widespread today in India.
