Abstract: ?The ?Scandalous? Tantric Hymn to K?l? Karp?r?di-stotra: An 
Expurgated Translation, by John R. Dupuche

Through his Tantrik Texts Series (1913-1940) Sir John Woodroffe 
initiated modern Western studies of the tantras. However, his 1922 
translation of the Karp?r?di-stotra reveals how much he and his 
collaborators felt constrained to purge the scandalous aspects from the 
text. It is seriously flawed, and yet still commonly used. This article 
describes the rather complex story of the editions and commentaries on 
the stotra, together with some suggestions on date and authorship. It 
then provides an unexpurgated translation of the Karp?r?di-stotra along 
with the Sanskrit text. Lastly, it provides a short commentary on the 
structure of the text and its purpose.
A question arises: if Woodroffe had to conceal essential elements of the 
Karp?r?di-stotra, how reliable are the other translations and 
commentaries in his Tantrik Texts Series?
