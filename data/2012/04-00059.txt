Fwd: French Institute of Pondicherry / Publications April 2012
Dear Jean-Luc,
I presume the suggestion in your message is that it is improper for several colleagues with a (past) EFEO connection to be involved in a new Indological series published by the IFP outside of the framework of the EFEO-IFP series Collection Indologie, and that you find it ironic that the IFP has named the new/tentative series after a scholar who was for 21 years of the 20th century director of the EFEO.
Could you provide such a convenient link for the diagnosis of Fran?ois Gros, or a scan? I do not know what document you are talking about, and I suppose this holds for most other list members, although I am not sure everybody cares.
Best wishes,
Arlo Griffiths
