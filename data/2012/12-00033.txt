Dear Patrick,

I would guess it is an abbreviated version of a stock passage. In Pali 
we have:

/puna capara?, bhikkhave, tath?gato dibbena cakkhun? visuddhena 
atikkantam?nusakena satte passati cavam?ne upapajjam?ne h?ne pa??te 
suva??e dubba??e, sugate duggate yath?kamm?page satte paj?n?ti/

This is found at AN III 418; V 35f.; 38; Pa?is II 175; cf. MN I 70; Vibh 
344. The sequence occurs elsewhere with various speakers and addressees, 
but here the honorific /tath?gato/ is equivalent to /aha?/. The sequence 
occurs also in abbreviated forms; so a citation as /puna capara?, 
bhikkhave, tath?gato dibbena cakkhun? ... pe ... sugate duggate 
yath?kamm?page satte paj?n?ti/ would not be surprising.

The stock passage occurs in Sanskrit also e.g. in the Sa?ghabhedavastu:
MSV IV 221: /sa eva? sam?hite citte ... divyena cak?u?? 
vi?uddhen?tikr?ntam?nu?yakena satv?n pa?yati cyavam?n?n upapadyam?n?n 
api suvar??n api durvar??n api h?n?n api pra??t?n api sugatim api 
gacchato durgatim api yath?karmopayog?n satv?n yath?bh?ta? praj?n?ti//
/
and in various Mah?y?na contexts, but something closer to the Pali 
version probably existed in /s?tras/ that are no longer extant. Indeed, 
a longer search might find a closer parallel in surviving fragments 
somewhere.
