Kuppuswami Sastri Institute facing a financial deficit
This is very distressing. I have had fruitful contact with the institute since the mid 1960's, and have lectured there on several occasions.  Their scholarly enterprise and hospitality merit the strongest efforts to maintain this valuable institute.  Is it possible for a fund to be set up with contributions from scholars in India and elsewhere?  George
