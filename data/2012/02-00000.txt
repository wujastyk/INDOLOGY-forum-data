Dear Stephen,

You may find it useful to look at B. K. Matilal's The Navya-ny?ya doctrine of negation: the semantics and ontology of negative statements in Navya-ny?ya philosophy (Harvard Oriental Series). Though not at all on Buddhism, it contains a great deal of valuable material on the question in Indian philosophy generally.

On Buddhist approaches in particular, you may wish to consult,
Y. Kajiyama, "Three Types of Affirmation and Two Types of Negation in Buddhist Philosophy," Wiener Zeitschrift fiir die Kunde Sadasiens 17(1973). 

Hope this is of some use.

Matthew
