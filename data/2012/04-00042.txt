International Indology Graduate Research Symposium in Edinburgh
Dear list members,
The fourth International Indology Graduate Research Symposium (IIGRS 4)
will be held this year at the University of Edinburgh on the 4th-5th of
September. Please find information, and the call for papers at
http://iigrs.byethost17.com/ . The symposium is aimed at current graduate
students and early stage researchers i.e. those who have completed their
last degree within the past five years. The deadline for submitting
abstracts is the 21st of May 2012. The proceedings of the symposium will be
published.
I would be very grateful if you could circulate this information to any
students or early stage researchers you know who may be interested.
Many thanks,
On behalf of the IIGRS team,
Robert Leach
