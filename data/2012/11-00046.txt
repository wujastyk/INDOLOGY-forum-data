Subject: m-/b- alternation in Burushaski
Message-ID: <161227098022.23782.10792923119089636902.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

The list may recall our discussion on Narmada and Narbada alternation, and
the possible sound change where intervocalic labial nasal transforms to
become an oral stop along the following lines: *-m- > -**??*- > -v/*b*-.

However, I was surprised to find a word-initial alternation of m and b in
one of the famous papers Witzel wrote in 1999 (he was very prolific in that
year). He  says the following in this paper (
http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~witzel/MT-Substrates.pdf):

North of this area, at the northern bend of the Indus (Baltistan/Hunza),
 Burushaski is spoken. However, the language and the tribal name are
indirectly attested in this general area ever since the RV: **m/b*ru?a
 (mod. buru?o) > Ved. M?ja-vant, Avestan Mu?a.


Is such m-/b- alternation a known Burushaski phenomenon? Witzel seems to
suggest that Mru?a was the the ancient self designation of the Burusho-
people but, unfortunately, without any helpful references.

I appreciate any information or pointers on such transformation.

Thanks,
Suresh.

It is interesting that Brahui, a Dravidian language now found in the
southwestern corner of Pakistan, also shows a similar transformation:

**m?(l)-*  'over, above' > Br. b*?-*
**mi**?- '*to leap'* > *Br.* ***bi**?- *'to throw, let drop'

However, this change is apparently conditioned by a following front vowel
(Dravidian nasals in Brahui, Krishnamurti 2001:121-126), and perhaps
unrelated to the above alternation.
