As someone who will be teaching an intro course called "Philosophy East and
West" this coming academic year, the article Justin Smith published in
nytimes.com resonated with me. I'm glad that Matthew Kapstein posted it to
this list.

This may not be the most appropriate forum to ask, but given the wide
reading of the members of this list, maybe some will have good suggestions
to the following query. I'm currently looking for are clear, accessible
statements -- proof-texts if you like -- from Western philosophical
literature of the claim that non-western philosophy (Indian, Chinese,
Islamic, African, etc.) is not philosophy or is otherwise lesser in some
respect. Most often, this is an implicit assumption or one easily follows.
I'm looking for a few choice quotes or short readings that will make an
impact undergraduates with little to no prior exposure to the issue.

Thanks for any suggestions you might have.

Sincerely,

David Fiordalis
Linfield College
