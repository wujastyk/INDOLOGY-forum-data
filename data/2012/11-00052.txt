Dear  SP,
you write
<QUOTE SP>
"This interpretation of /k?maram/ as /c?k?maram/ is as silly as
  equating the word /r?ga/ with /?r?r?ga/, a specific melody, and 
reflects these commentators' ignorance of epigraphic evidence of the use 
of the word /k?maram/.
</QUOTE SP>
How would you comment on the use of K?maram
in the Tirumu?aika??apur??am?
in this verse:
????????? ??????? ??????????? ??????????? /
?????? ???????? ???????? ??????????????? /
??????? ??????????? ??????????? ???????? /
???????? ?????????? ????????? ?????????? (42)
o???ku? k?nt?ra pa?camattuk k?rira???m /
na????a c?rna??a p??aikku navi??uraikkil /
ku???ta pu?an?rmaik kira???ku? k??umicai /
o???kak k?marattuk ko???kap p???i??r (42)
This is part of the enumeration where ka??a?ai-s are attributed to the 
various pa?-?
See the translation by Karen Pechilis Prentiss
in the /International Journal of Hindu Studies 5, 1 (April 2001)
where this verse is translated on pp. 40-41.
See also the pages 212-213 inside the 1947 book /Y?? N?l/
by Vipul?nanta Cuv?mika?
(published by the Karantai Tami? Ca?kam).
where he reproduces a section of
Tirumu?aika??apur??am.
He later discusses two ka??a?ai-s for c?k?maram
on p. 235-236.
That seems to mean that Vipul?nanta Cuv?mika?
accepts the equation between "c?k?maram"
and "k?maram".
(is this not parallel to the fact that the same place can be referred to 
as K??i and as C?k??i?)
I suppose that means that all of that is open for discussion.
I would like to comment that usings words such as "silly" and 
"parroting" does not belong in an academic discussion. These words are 
unnecessarily aggressive or insulting. :-(
It is enough to say that one disagrees with other people's interpretations.
Thanks for the many interesting insights which your post contains
