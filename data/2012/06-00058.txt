Subject: A verse listing ten uses for the Sanskrit present tense
Message-ID: <161227096560.23782.419101437237089909.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear colleagues, 
 
this is a question for the Vaiy?kara?as. In his Vy?khy?yukti, Vasubandhu cites a verse which lists ten instances where the present tense is used - and these all might be instances where the present tense is used for something past. The text is only preserved in Tibetan translation, and I was wondering whether anyone knows where the list might be from. It is followed by examples for each of these uses. My understanding of the ten uses is: 

(1) Incompletion, (2) proximity to the present, (3) capability, (4) continuity, (5) disposition, (6) general state of affairs, (7) repetition, (8) becoming, (9) desire, (10) perfection. 
  
The Tibetan reads: 
 
ma zin ?id da? ?e ba ?id /
/ nus da? rgyun mi 'chad ?id da? /
/ de ?a? (corr. : da?) chos ?id ya? da? ya? /
/ srid da? 'dod rdzogs rnams la 'byu? /
 
Help would be greatly appreciated, 
 
all the best, 
 
Birgit Kellner
