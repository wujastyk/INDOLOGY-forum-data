Dear Colleagues

We are a small and rather isolated Sanskrit community in Australia. As such, our students cannot reach a very wide audience for their work. I hope you don't mind me sharing this with you. Here is a wonderful creation from two 3rd year students at ANU, Steve Johnston (a professional artist) and Nada Cat.
