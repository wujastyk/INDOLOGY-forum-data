Dear All,
does anybody have access to the Encyclopaedia of Buddhism, ed. Malalasekera, Government of Ceylon 2002(!!!), Vol. 2, p. 389. There is some information on the Kankhavitarani Pitapota on that page.
Earlier versions of the Encyclopaedia do not contain that article. It would be great, if somebody could send me a scan.
Best,
Petra
