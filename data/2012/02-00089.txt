Dear Michael and All,

I cannot believe this sad news.  He invited me to his lecture
at the occasion of the Agnicayana last April.  Without his invitation
I should have hesitated to go to Panjal. 
I was one of his long time friends since I attended his lectures
in Kyoto University in  late 1960s. I visited him at his home
in Berkeley in 1986.
I wanted to visit him at his home in Thailand, but it is now too late!

sad news to us. He will be missed by many. Luckily, some of us saw him 
last at the great Atiratra Agnicayana at Panjal in Kerala, April 2011, 
which he first recorded in 1975 and published in 1983 ("Agni").
