Mangala- title for brahmin physicians
In Tamil inscriptions, one notices that brahmin physicians are given titles with the first component being maGkala- as in maGkalappEraraiyan2. Is there any  Sanskrit/Prakrit inscriptions or literary texts that show any physician in north India with the title maGgala-?
Thanks in advance
