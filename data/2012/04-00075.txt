Subject: Mangala- title for brahmin physicians
Message-ID: <161227096070.23782.14246525857094751612.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

In Tamil inscriptions, one notices that brahmin physicians are given titles with the first component being maGkala- as in maGkalappEraraiyan2. Is there any  Sanskrit/Prakrit inscriptions or literary texts that show any physician in north India with the title maGgala-?


Thanks in advance


Regards,
