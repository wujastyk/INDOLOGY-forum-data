Fw: [INDOLOGY] svara as breathing/respiration
Thank you Sir very much for your valuable information. We?find in?Yogic texts, Svara is used in term of praa.na. 
?
As you would know, there is a text available?known as?"svarodaya". I wonder why it is?called svarodaya"saastra, why not?praa.nodaya.
?
As per avaialble materials we find in its colophon: iti umaamahe"svarasa.mbaade svarodayaj~naana.m sa.mpuur.nam. After?I closely went?through available aagamas and puraa.nas I?could not?find its source text. I would be grateful for?further?information and help on this subject.
?
?
Once again thanks to all of you for your valuable informations.
?
with Best Regards,?

Re: [INDOLOGY] svara as breathing/respiration
In the description of the generation of sound, P??in?ya?ik?? vss 6cd and 7ab state:
?The mind hits the bodily fire, that sends the (bodily) wind (=breath), the breath roaming in the breast generates a charming svara.? 
The place of the wind ie breast seems to indicate that life-breath that is Pr??a is meant. Not itself svara it is held responsible for its generation.

[INDOLOGY] svara as breathing/respiration
Respected Scholars,
I?am looking for the earliest textual?references?of?"svara" used in term of "breathing" apart from Yogic texts. 
I find close evidences i.e ?"praa.na is svara" in Upanisads.Still I look for it?in particular in?tantra literature.?
Thank you all in advance for your help and suggestions!
Regards,
