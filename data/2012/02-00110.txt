FW: [INDOLOGY] Prenatal suffering [Was: A Query re the              development of garbha]
Dear Paolo,
What a horrible view of female anatomy. Thanks a lot for the details. You are correct to note that these yoniyantra atrocities stand as opposites to the Freudian views of fetal womb bliss. However, some of the analysts also devised treatments to enable people to recover from what they called, ?birth trauma?, experienced at exit from the womb. It was called, ?primal scream? therapy.
No surprise about the Shaivite ideas of gestation and birth. 
On to east Asia: have you ever seen this one, the menstruation sutra (attached)? 
Then the Chinese also have tales about the blood pond in Hell, where women who died in childbirth end up.
