the research group ?Practices of Argumentation in Transcultural 
Perspective.? The research group is situated within the Cluster ?Asia 
and Europe in a Global Context,? funded by the German Federal Excellence 
Initiative, and aims at working towards a more credible global history 
of truth and rationality by providing historically situated studies of 
practices of argumentation and the implicit standards of validity 
embodied within them.

here:
