Zvelebil recommended reading Kalki's works, which are written in a simple style, to build up vocabulary and get the language in your head.  Then, for old Tamil, A K Ramanujan would have started with U V Swaminathaier's edition of the Ku?untokai, which I would also recommend.  Jean Luc's recommendations are also excellent -- Rajam is an indispensable reference work, and her chapters on how the literature is put together will provide an excellent introduction.  But, as with learning any classical language, nothing can replace poring over the text and, at first, looking up every other word.  George Hart
