Since many Indologists are from Nepal:

Dear Colleagues,

We are pleased to announce the publication of _Gender, Social Change and
the Media_, eds. by Johannes D. Schmidt and Torsten R. Berg, Delhi:
Rawat Publications, 2012. Pp. 240. Rs.695 / US$45 (Hardcover). ISBN:
978-81-316-0513-4

This book is an informative, engaging and critical attempt to contribute
to a profound discussion about gender and social change in landlocked
Nepal in South Asia. It covers new ground relating to the challenges
women face in terms of the enormous changes taking place in society and
is an important addition to the existing scanty literature on social,
cultural and historical change in contemporary Nepal.
