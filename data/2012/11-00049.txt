Subject: [INDOLOGY] m-/b- alternation in Burushaski
 

The list may recall our discussion on?Narmada and Narbada alternation, and the possible sound change where intervocalic?labial?nasal transforms to become an oral stop along the following lines:?-m- > -??- > -v/b-.?

However, I was surprised to find a word-initial alternation of m and b in one of the famous papers Witzel wrote in 1999 (he was very prolific in that year). He ?says the following in this paper (http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~witzel/MT-Substrates.pdf):?

North of this area, at the northern bend of the Indus (Baltistan/Hunza), ?Burushaski?is spoken. However, the language and the tribal name are indirectly attested in this general?area ever since the RV: *m/bru?a ?(mod. buru?o) > Ved. M?ja-vant, Avestan Mu?a.

Is such m-/b- alternation a known Burushaski phenomenon? Witzel seems to suggest that?Mru?a was the?the ancient self designation of the Burusho- people but, unfortunately, without any helpful references.


I appreciate any information or pointers on such transformation.

Thanks,
Suresh.

It is interesting that Brahui, a Dravidian language now found in the southwestern corner of Pakistan, also shows a similar transformation:

*m?(l)-? 'over, above' > Br. b?-
*mi?- 'to leap'?>?Br.?*bi?-?'to throw, let drop'

However, this change is apparently conditioned by a?following front vowel (Dravidian nasals in Brahui, Krishnamurti 2001:121-126), and perhaps unrelated to the above alternation.?
