new book
Dear All,
Here, with great promptness (thanks to Petteri Koskikallio), is the TOC of this volume (and my apologies for the message a minute or two ago without the attachment -- problems with transmission).
Yours

Re: [INDOLOGY] new book
Great news!  Could you please post a TOC or a link to one? My brief search online did not turn one up (even at MLBD).
My best,
Steven
