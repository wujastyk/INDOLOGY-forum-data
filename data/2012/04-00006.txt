Dear Computer Wizards:

Here is a problem that, I hope, a wizard out there can solve. I am using a MAC (OS 10.7.3) and trying to type Devan?gar? on "Pages" with the Devanagari-QWERTY keyboard and Tahoma font. It works beautifully, except for a few annoying problems.

1. for the conjunct "?v" and "?v" the Qwerty functions well. I can even write well "?vi" and "?vi". But when these come immediately after another letter, for example "?" or "g" -- the ligature between the two letters break down, and we have "?" with a vir?ma followed by "v". However, if the same conjunct is preceded by TWO letters, the ligature remains intact!! This seems like witchcraft perpetrated on me who need these ligatures preceded by just one letter!!!

2. Another big problem with the Devanagari-QWERTY is the it is unable to form a proper ligature of the guttural nasal "?" and a following "k" or "g", even though it does perfectly the ligature between the nasal and the conduct "k?". Go figure!! 

Any help in overcoming these problems would be deeply appreciated by an ignoramus in Texas.

Thanks.

Patrick
