The first picture looks like a board for what is known in
Bengal as the indoor game of ?capturing the tiger?. Sometimes it is also called the ?Mogul-Pathan?
game. The chesslike game is still popular in villages but not in the cities. It
is one of the dying indigenous pastimes. There are quite a few others, both outdoor
and indoor. Only Kabadi has got international recognition.

[INDOLOGY] Games
Dear Colleagues, 
I am looking for some information about the two following questions : 
1) Does anyone know the origin of the Indonesian game Surakarta, beyond the evident fact that its name is related to the name of the city Surakarta ? 
2) When visiting Buddhist caves, one often finds peculiar drawings such as shown by the attached picture (attachment 3), from Nasik. Could it be the board of a game and is there any litterature about the games played by the Buddhist monks ? 
Thank you for your answer(s), 
Regards, 
Dr J.M.Delire, University of Brussels
