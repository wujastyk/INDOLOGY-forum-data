Sanskrit formant frequencies
An addition to the discussion about frequency of speech formants (although 
I'm not sure whether this really answers the initial question): 
You find a dataset of all syllables in the DCS at
http://kjc-fs-cluster.kjc.uni-heidelberg.de/dcs/data/syllables/syllables.htm
(syllables.dat, link at the bottom of the page)
Vowels should be easy to extract from the data.
The top part of the page displays the proportions of consonant types in the 
different historical layers of the corpus. The R code used to produce the 
plot is also linked at the bottom of the page.
Hope it helps!
Best, Oliver Hellwig
