Dear Patrick,
There are quite a lot of free online tools that do this now: 
<http://learnsanskrit.org/tools/sanscript>
<http://www.tyfen.com/sanscription/>
<http://www.yash.info/indianLanguageConverter/hindi.html>
For professional typesetting purposes, XeLaTeX with TECkit works beautifully: <http://cikitsa.blogspot.com/2010/07/how-do-i-install-romdev-mapping-for.html>
Best,
Michael Slouber
