Dear Patrick,

There are quite a lot of free online tools that do this now: 

<http://learnsanskrit.org/tools/sanscript>
<http://www.tyfen.com/sanscription/>
<http://www.yash.info/indianLanguageConverter/hindi.html>

For professional typesetting purposes, XeLaTeX with TECkit works beautifully: <http://cikitsa.blogspot.com/2010/07/how-do-i-install-romdev-mapping-for.html>

Best,

Michael Slouber
