a question about 'dalit'
I have the collected works of Jotirao Phule and will look into that
publication.  But it is my general sense that the modern use of the word is
relatively recent.  During my childhood, the more common term was Harijan
"people of God" made popular by Mahatma Gandhi, and the usage of Dalit came
more from the leaders of the down-trodden communities themselves, perhaps
as a response to Gandhi's usage of Harijan.  In any case, I will look into
the published works of Phule.
