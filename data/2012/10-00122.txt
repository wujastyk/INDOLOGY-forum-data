Dear Indology Colleagues,

I was wondering two questions:

(1) If Sanskrit presents a single term with the ideological baggage of 
the Greek Logos: (a term that stands for thought, reason, word/language, 
opinion)

(2) If the answer to (1) is yes, if such a term is of special importance 
for any particular school of thought.

My impression is that while Indian languages have many words for reason 
or knowledge, opinion and thought, and words for linguistic items such 
as "word," these are often different words.

Thanks in advance!
