Fwd: [INDOLOGY] Edward Conze's Memoirs
If I recall corrrectly, Conze specified that vol. 3 was
not be made public until 50 years after his decease. But
I do not know if this was formally written into his will.
It seems to be well known that, among other things, it
contains his anti-Semitic rants, particularly directed
against Arthur Waley, against whom, despite their
several collaborations (as in _Buddhist Texts Through
the Ages_) Conze could never pardon the fact of having
been born a Polish Jew (apparently a double deficiency!).
