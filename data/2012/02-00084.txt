A Query re the development of garbha
Dear Arthur and List,
/
?ivadharmottara Pur??/a 8, 26-52 describes the different stages of the 
conception, formation and development of the embryo, up to the point 
when the /j?va /acquires consciousness and remembrance of his past 
sorrowful incarnations, pledging to put an end to such course in his 
life soon to begin through the study of /?ivaj??na/! (a pledge, alas! 
soon to be forgotten because of the hellish tortures inflicted by the 
/yoniyantra /and of the agony of childbirth).
The relevant passage (28-29) apparently contemplates three main phases, 
marked by three different terms (which do not include /ka?hina/): 
/kalala/, /arbuda /(/budbuda/ in another MS) and /pe??/.
/tac chukra? raktasa?yuktam ek?h?t kalala? bhavet
     pa?car?tre?a kalalam arbud?k?rat?? vrajet
arbuda? saptar?tre?a m??sape?? bhavet tata?
     dvisapt?h?d bhavet pe?? raktam??sacit? d??h?/
