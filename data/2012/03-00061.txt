Announcement of a Sanskrit Search Engine
Dear list,
Greetings on the Nandana n?ma samvatsara?.
The Department of Sanskrit Studies, University of Hyderabad announces
release of the FIRST Search Engine for Sanskrit -- ???????  available at
* http://sanskrit.uohyd.ernet.in:8080/searchengine*
This search engine integrates a Sanskrit morphological analyser with the
basic search engine resulting in better search results.
*Features:*
    The Sanskrit Search Engine ??????? has following search options
     a)   Basic Search:This is a basic search feature where you can search
a bare string "as it as" .
     b)  Search with regular expressions:This allows one to search a string
with various patterns as shown below.
          i)  str1 AND str2: searches for the instances of both str1 and
str2 in the same text.
         ii) str1 OR str2: searches for the instances of either or both
occurences.
        iii) str1 +str2: occurences where str2 IS present and optionally
str1 may be.
        iv) "str1 str2": literal string "str1 str2"
          In addition you may use the wild characters '?' and '*'.
      c)  Search with morphology enabled: This allows one to search for
strings with variations in their forms due to inflectional suffixes.
            E.g. given ??? as a ??????????? (nominal stem) with gender
?????????? the machine searches occurences of various nominal declensions
of ??? such as ????? , ?????? etc. allowing the spelling variations (such
as ???? / ?????) as well.
