svara as breathing/respiration
The phrases pr??a? svara? and pr??o vai svara? occur many times  
already in the S?mavedic Br?hma?as, cf. respectively  
Pa?cavi??a-Br?hma?a 7,1,10; 17,12,2; Jaimin?ya-Br?hma?a 1,301 & 307,  
and PB 24,11,9; JB 1,123.140.164.215; 2,168; 3,194.229. However, in  
these phrases svara means 'tone' rather than breathing, see W.  
Caland's translation and comments on those text places.
