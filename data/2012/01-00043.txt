Summer Sanskrit @ Harvard
Dear Jack,
Here is some info regarding Michael Witzel's summer intensive at Harvard.
Basically, seven weeks of classes, four days a week (Monday - Thursday),
three hours (continuous) a day (3:15 - 6:15PM), 12 hours of classes a week.
Perhaps we should scale down the class time to make the program desirable.
The students should be able to do three hours of home work a day, and also
enjoy the Berkeley summer. Then it will be an attractive program, indeed!
