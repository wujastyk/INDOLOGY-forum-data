not exactly a Christmas present=?UTF-8?Q?=E2=80=A6?=
dear Elisa,
Thank you for the information, and I was eager to read your comments about
pricing, which indeed I did with much profit and stimulation of ideas (and
wonder at your generosity as well). But: would you please be a bit more
'homeland security' and censor the horrid remarks posted below? This is the
reason that the earlier Indology list locked itself behind some doors. It
can above all not be pleasant for you to be subjected to this rubbish. This
is not a question of freedom of speech but of respect.
very warmest, jonathan
