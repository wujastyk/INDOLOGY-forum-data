Verpoorten's book and article
Dear Members of the list,
My colleague and friend Jean-Marie Verpoorten, whose last book on  karman,  j?ti  and  sa?s?ra in early Buddhism is just issued
(see http://indologica.de/drupal/?q=node/2027 /  http://www.peeters-leuven.be/boekoverz.asp?nr=9084 )
asks me if it is possible for someone to provide him with a copy (.pdf or paper) of Jean-Marie Verpoorten's article entitled
"Les dieux v?diques Varu?a et Indra dans le Canon Bouddhique P?li", 
issued in Studia Asiatica : Revue internationale d'?tudes asiatiques = International Journal for Asian studies  (Romanian Association for the History of Religions ; Institute for the History of Religions, Romanian Academy, Bucharest), vol. 11/1-2 (= Proceedings of the 6th EASR / IAHR Special Conference Religious History of Europe and Asia, Bucharest, 20-23 September 2006, Volume 4-5), 2010, pp. 173-182 (see http://www.ihr-acad.ro/docs/periodice/stvdia_asiatica_xi_2010_1-7.pdf 
Apparently not yet available at: http://www.ceeol.com/aspx/publicationdetails.aspx?publicationid=7a5d5159-bbc2-4612-8ecd-666921f57978).
He is indeed himself unable to get a copy of his own contribution... that he would like to read in its published form!
Thanks for him
(in the case you can help, you can email me or him <jmverpoorten at gmail.com>)
With best wishes,
Christophe Vielle
