Manuscript libraries in India
Thanks to Dr. Rajam for mentioning the collection of the EFEO in Pondicherry (which has now been entirely digitised: see p.2 of www.ifpindia.org/IMG/pdf/pattrika_36.pdf).
The larger collection of the French Institute of Pondicherry should also be mentioned in this regard (http://www.ifpindia.org/-Manuscripts-.html).
