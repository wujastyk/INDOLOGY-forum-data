There is, at least, an alternative described on this webpage: <http://www.aupasana.com/stardict>. Disadvantage: it requires a two-step installation (first app, then dictionary files). On the other hand, one may use different dictionaries within one and the same application. Aupasana provides files with the dictionaries of Monier Williams and of Apte.

Hope it helps
