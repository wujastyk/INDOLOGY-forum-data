Dear scholarly members of Indology list,

As we are all aware, the texts of shastras have got a little chance to be
alive for long with out the technological advancement. The oral tradition
of many Vedic shakhas and texts is in danger. The knowledge that was not
preserved in script form was lost to us. Even the physical preservation of
manuscripts has become a challenge. Digi-techonlogy has given more
life-span to them. Still we need to work on preserving and spreading
knowledge systems. The text which did not enter the press-room has not seen
the light and yet stays in the dark. The branch of knowledge that did not
come to light and was not spread, could not survive for long. The
preservation of existing Sanskrit Sahstrik knowledge and their texts is our
responsibility. We are accountable for passing on them to the next
generation using all means of modern technology. One such technology is
wiki-techonology, which is one-stop solution to all problems.

Wiki-pedia and Wiki-soure have become a power tool for knowledge
preservation and knowledge dissemination. Currently all most all living
languages and cultures find place in wiki. This will create the future
history for any language and its knowledge case.

Very recently Sanskrit-wiki has been taken up by a team of young scholars
motivated by Sri Cha mu Krishna Shastry. With in short period Sanskrit has
got a significant place in Indian Languages in content generation and
usage.

Here is an appeal to you to join us in the great task of restoring Samskrit
Language to its pristine glory. A phenomenal project, which visualizes to
bridge the gap between ancient knowledge base and present world.
