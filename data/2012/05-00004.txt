In Kannada, the commonly used word in ?dhy?tmikate (which of course is Sanskrit ?dhy?tmikat?), but the same word also seems to be used as a supposed equivalent for 'spirituality'. As Dominik already said, it seems we have another example of incommensurability here.

And, most probably, there isn't, quite.  Much interesting work has been done on incommensurability in translation theory.
