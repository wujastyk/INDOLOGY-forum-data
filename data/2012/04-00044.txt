Hero Stone from Vijayanagara
Dear Indologists,
Does anyone, by any chance, have access to a better (higher resolution) of this image, that he/she would be willing to allow me to use for publication? 
The stone is at Vijayanagara, near NN z/2
I am in need of this particular hero stone, and I am in Delhi, and not keen to ramble through the weeds at Hampi in April!
I would be MOST grateful for the help. My apologies for cross posting.
