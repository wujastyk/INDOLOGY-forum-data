Further to my query about the Anup Skt. library catalogue, it appears to me that in the 1993 reprint, all the manuscript numbers have been changed.  The attached PDF, shows what the catalogue looks like now.  The first two columns are "general no." and "serial no.", the latter being serial numbers within the subject divisions of the catalogue.  There are no other numbers.  But I find that older references to Anup MSS, such as in Pingree's 1997 "Astronomy at the Court of Anupasimha," in his From Astral Omens book, Meulenbeld's HIML, etc., all refer to four-digit numbers for each MS.  If you have the 1940s edition of the catalogue handy, could you confirm or deny that the earlier catalogue has a completely different numbering system for MSS?
There's no note about this in the 1993 edition, nor any new prelim material.
Best,
Dominik

Dear Colleagues,
Is anyone aware of a digital copy of the Catalogue of the Anup Sanskrit Library by C Kunhan Raja and
K. Madhava Krishna Sarma (Bikaner: The Authority, [Govt. Press], 1944-1948)?  It was reprinted in 1993.
I've looked in the Digital Library of India, Archive.org, bookfi dot org, and one or two other places.  On Google books I find fasc. II of 1946 and the 1993 reprint, but neither is downloadable.
Best,
