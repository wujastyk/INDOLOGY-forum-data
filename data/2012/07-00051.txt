Ordering Bori mss in microfilm
Dear list,
Does any one have experience ordering copies of manuscripts from the Bhandarkar Institute that have been microfilmed? 
The one time I collected manuscripts from them I went in person and had photocopies made, but I also know that some manuscripts are available on microfilm. I assume that it is possible to order copies of specific mss, but am unclear on how to go about it 
It has been a number of years since I was there and the people in charge have changed. I have not found the website helpful with respect to ordering copies. 
Any help as to the best way to receive copies in a relatively timely manner would be most appreciated! 
Best,Benjamin
