Some members of the list might be interested in the following announcement, apparently applications from South Asianists would be welcomed:


> ANNOUNCING
> 
> 
> A NEW TRAINING Program for Scholars, conservators and researchers in
> the Use of Reflectance Transformation imaging (RTI)  for Documenting
> ancient texts and artifacts  including the Loan of Imaging Equipment
> 
> 
> The University of Southern California's West Semitic Research Project
> (www.usc.edu/dept/LAS/wsrp) has received grants from the Institute
> for Museum and Library Services (IMLS) and the Andrew W. Mellon
> Foundation to establish a Training Program in advanced imaging
> technologies for the documentation of ancient texts and artifacts
> with an initial emphasis on Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI).
> The IMLS and the Mellon Foundation have also funded the purchase of
> imaging equipment to support the Training Program.
> 
> The objective of this project is to develop an infrastructure for
> training scholars in the use of RTI technology and subsequently to
> lend the necessary imaging equipment to participants in the training
> program so they can do an initial RTI documentation project either in
> field environments (archaeological sites, etc.) or in libraries,
> museums and/or other similar venues, worldwide. This initial
> undertaking should be understood to be a pilot project that can
> develop into an ongoing, broader documentary effort and preferably
> may also serve as the catalyst for establishing a consortial network
> for image documentation of a given corpus (or corpora) of ancient
> texts and/or artifacts.  All equipment to be lent out is both rugged
> and compact and is thus ideal for doing sophisticated imaging in
> remote locations. Twenty-four awards over three years (approximately
> eight per year) for traineeships will be provided based on the merit
> and intrinsic importance of a proposed pilot imaging project as well
> as the appropriateness of the subject matter for RTI imaging.
