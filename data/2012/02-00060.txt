Hindu idea of "hidden" verses in heaven
Olivelle wrote that ?[t]he motif of a large treatise composed in illo
tempore and subsequently abridged for the use of humans is a recurrent one
in Indian literature? (in his ed. of the M?navadharma??stra, p. 19 fn. 24).
He adduces the K?mas?tra and the Su?rutasa?hit? as parallels to this motif
in the M?navadharma??stra.
The N??ya??stra is also structured around this motif (the text was composed
by Brahma before it devolved to Bharata and then Kohala, and then Bharata's
sons, to promulgate on earth). ??rad?tanaya's Bh?vaprak??ana also has a
similar story: Brahma asks ?iva to teach him drama, ?iva delegates this
task to Nandike?vara, and the tradition is given to a sage and his five
students (Bharatas) to take to earth and perform for Manu. Then there's a
process of summarization: the Bharatas condense the original N??yaveda into
a half-length epitome of 6,000 verses (p. 287 of the GOS edition, lines 7
ff.).
