Dear Friends,

In searching the online edition of the WZKS for Toru Funayama's
1995 article on "Arca.ta et al. on the Aim of a Treatise"
(WZKS 39: 181-203), I have not been able to locate it.

Might any of you be able to help with a pdf, or let me know
if there some better way to access the WZKS online than
the site of the Austrian Academy?

with thanks in advance;,
