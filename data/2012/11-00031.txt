Question on Pali syntax
Dear Madhav,
Edgerton, BHSG #25.4, p. 129 notes "frequent use of atthi with plural subject," referring to Geiger 141.1 ("otherwise this usage seems to be virtually ignored in the books on Pali or Pkt." -- I haven't checked Oberlies on this).
As noted by Edgerton, this is a manifestation of a broader phenomenon in MIA whereby  the 3rd. sg. verb is beginning to be generalized to all persons and numbers.
