I already had this one sometime ago. One has to download each letter-volume. But this is quite reader-friendly.Perhaps, the frequent updating of adobe often renders the many other online editions? difficult to use or time consuming. I gave up the some others after some attempts.
Many help seekers must have been silent ones like me and also thankful for the information received.. Once I contemplated buying Malalasekhara's work. Now I find that unnecessary.
Best

There are also at least two online versions of the Dictionary of Pali Proper Names, very easy to use.
