Relics cult in India - a query
Dear Dipak, dear List Members,
Thanks. The search at JSTOR, sadly, doesn't show any results. And I
don't believe any library in Poland would have JRASB on its shelves.
Could anyone with access to the Journal make, please, a copy - xerox,
scan - of the first 15 pages and post it here?
Regards,
Artur Karp
