sad new: Frits Staal
I was also introduced to Staal through his 'Euclid and Panini', which gave
me a totally new perspective about Panini.
Most of his articles served as bridges for students like us who did not
have any formal training in Sanskrit shastras.
I was also benefited personally when he accepted my invitation and
delivered a distinguished lecture at the University
of Hyderabad on 5th March 2008 on 'The Classification of Knowledge ACROSS
THE CENTURIES'.
This was the first distinguished lecture our department organised.
May his soul rest in peace.

Amba Kulkarni
