gay-atri
Dear List,
I recently attended a satsanga where the acarya of the ashram revealed the
secret to preventing one's children from becoming homosexuals was indeed to
have them engage daily for several months, if not years, in the performance
of 12,000 rounds of japa of the *gay*-atri mantra.
However, he qualified his statement by insisting it must be done before
puberty, otherwise it is too late...
I found his pun delightful, however, it has led me to ponder what, if any,
advice is there in the shastras for explaining/rationalising homosexuality?
Or for mitigating this "affliction that has come to India from the
licentious West"...?
All the best,
