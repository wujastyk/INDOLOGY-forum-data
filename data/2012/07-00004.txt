Date of Bhavatr=?utf-8?Q?=C4=81ta?=
Dear Indologists,
In his article, 'Codification of Vedic domestic ritual in Kerala: Pa?rvan?a-stha?li?pa?ka', in the International Symposium, The Book , Romania, 20-24 September 2010,  Asko Parpola writes, "In any case, the Nampu?tiris were in Kerala in the 7th century CE, when the grandfather of the great Jaimini?ya commentator Bhavatra?ta migrated to Kerala from the village of Vasis?t?hakut?i (modern Tit?t?agud?i near Vr?ddha?calam) in the Co?l?a kingdom (cf. PARPOLA 1984)." (Unfortunately the reference PARPOLA 1984 seems to be missing.)
I am puzzled by this reference. because the name Vasi??haku?i makes its appearance for the first time in a ca. 1398 CE  inscription of the Viruppa??a U?aiy?r (SII 8, No. 286) which mentions "?ri Vasi??haku?i ??a Vidy?ra?yapurattu...". Earlier inscriptions only mention the brahmadeyam Ti??aiku?i aka  Tirucci??ampalaccaturvetima?kalam (or its variants). The earlier inscriptions cover several C??a and P???iya inscriptions.  It was probably Viruppa??a who renamed Ti??aku?i as Vidy?ra?yapuram in honor of the M?dhava-Vidy?ra?ya.  For a long time I had assumed Vasis?t?hakut?i  was a slightly earlier awkward attempt at Sanskritization of Tamil Ti??aiku?i. After all the earlier inscriptions could have rendered the name Vasis?t?hakut?i since these inscriptions used a mixture of both Tamil and Grantha script characters. I cannot think of any reason why the inscriptions would not have used the name Vasis?t?hakut?i.
Can somebody with access to Bhavatr?ta's work tell me if he refers to Vasis?t?hakut?i and C??a kingdom in his work? Given that there was no C??a kingdom in the area at that time, is the ca. 700 date for Bhavatr?ta confirmed? 
Thanks in advance.

Palaniappan
