simple work on Vyakarana for non-specialists
I have a friend who teaches English grammar in a correspondence school.? I would like to give him a notion of the glories of? the Sanskrit grammatical tradition.? Can someone recommend a good sketch for someone with no indological background of how Paninian grammar works, and of the tradition of grammar and philosophical grammar after him?? I am thinking of something of the length of a chapter in a book or a pamphlet.
Thanks,
Allen
