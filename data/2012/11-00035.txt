Question on Pali syntax
Dear Madhav,
I wouldn't discount Sujato's explanation either. I think the two types of explanations are on different levels, and not mutually exclusive; more like two sides of the coin.
As Mark pointed out in his response, we see this sort of thing ("wrong" verb forms, syntax, etc.) all over the place in Gandhari manuscript texts; language change in action! I also suspect there is more of it than meets the eye (because leveled out by editors ancient and modern) in Pali and even in Sanskrit.
