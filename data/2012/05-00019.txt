Fwd: [INDOLOGY] Edward Conze's Memoirs
Sorry for noticing only now that these Memoirs are available through the wiki page on Conze:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Conze
(cf. also http://www.conze.elbrecht.com/)
But maybe some people know more about the manuscript of the "unrevealed" third part of these Memoirs (of which only the Table of contents is given)
D?but du message r?exp?di? :
