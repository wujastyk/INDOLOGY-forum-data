This list is unmoderated, George.  Your INDOLOGY posts go straight to all
the members as soon as you hit "send."

Neither I nor the INDOLOGY managing committee accept responsibility for
copyright violations by members.  It is up to you to check whether you
signed away your copyright and, if so, whether the new owners of your
research publications will give you permission to distribute copies.

I leave it to you to deduce the moral of this tale.

Best,
Dominik, INDOLOGY committee
