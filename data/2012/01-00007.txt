The ongoing debate on research publishing
The latest salvo in the contemporary debate on access to research
publications is discussed in yesterday's New York Times:

The new Bill says:
No Federal agency may adopt, implement, maintain, continue, or otherwise
engage in any policy, program, or other activity that--
(1) causes, permits, or authorizes network dissemination of any
private-sector research work without the prior consent of the publisher of
such work; or
(2) requires that any actual or prospective author, or the employer of such
an actual or prospective author, assent to network dissemination of a
private-sector research work.
Thus, while the wording of this Bill is muddy, it aims to legislate that no
Federal body in the US can have a policy that requires or even encourages
an academic researcher to publish their work in Open Access journals, or
put a copy on their own, or their university's, website.
