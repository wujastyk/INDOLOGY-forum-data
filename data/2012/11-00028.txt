Hello Joseph,

     The Pali expression paccorohanii almost certainly corresponds to
Sanskrit Pratyavaroha??, rather than Pa?carohani.  The verb pratyavarohati
(Ardhamagadhi: paccoruhai) is commonly found in the Br?hma?a texts like the
?atapatha.  I am not so familiar with all the  ritual literature, but there
may be a ritual in the Br?hma?as that is referred to by this name.  Best,

Madhav Deshpande
