Annual Report of South Indian Epigraphy, 1917, part II, para 24
Annual Report of South Indian Epigraphy, 1917, Vol. V, p. 111

JRASB, Letters, Vols, VIII, pp. 317-21; IX, p. 101; Vol. XIV, p. 106; XVII, pp. 296ff 

Indian Antiquary, 1893, pp. 57f.

I would greatly appreciate anyone who can email me a scan of any of these.

Thanks in advance.
