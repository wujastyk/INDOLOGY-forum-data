Dear members of the list!
I am happy to inform you that our new encyclopedia (after the Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophy, Vostochnaya literatura, Moscow 2009), this time on the Buddhist Philosophy, has appeared in Publishing House Vostochnaya literatura (Moscow, Russia). There are entries on different philosophical and religious terms, notions, schools and problems in Indian, Chinese, Japanese, Tibetain and other forms of Buddhism. Indexes in different languages cover over 80 pages. The total number of pages is 1045. It is a huge and heavy volume! The general editor of both encyclopedias is Marietta Stepanyantz. Entries are written mostly by Russian scholars, only some papers  on Japanese Buddhism were contributed by Japanese buddhologists.
