the Brill Typeface--MAC. Linux
I attach a sample of text typeset with the new Brill font.  I used the
"Rare" ligature setting that give the c+t and s+t ligatures, etc.  I also
used non-lining digits.  Brill says that the font is modelled on
Baskerville.
For this document, my fontspec setting, for use with XeLaTeX, was:
\setmainfont[Mapping=tex-text,
Numbers=OldStyle,
Ligatures={Rare},
AutoFakeBold=1.5]{Brill}
The Brill font is rich in diacritical marks, symbols, IPA, Greek, Cyrillic
and other glyphs.  It does not include Devanagari.
Best,
Dominik
