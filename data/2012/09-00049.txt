Dear Colleagues, 

Here are two films that I use quite often in the introductory courses I teach on Hinduism : 
The Wages of Action, Religion in a Hindu village, a great film on popular hinduism in a village of Uttar Pradesh. It is easily divided into different section, which is useful when teaching. The classical (and marvelous) Satyajit Ray's Devi, The Godess, that find it very good to illustrate darsana. 
All the best, 

Rapha?l Voix

Dear colleagues,

sorry if the film "Vari - an Indian Pilgrimage" by the great ethnologist Guenther Sontheimer and Henning Stegmueller (1989 http://www.onlinefilm.org/de_DE/film/51112) has already been mentioned during this exchange of information.
It is one of the most fascinating and moving - in the best sense of the word - documentaries I have ever seen.

Best wishes
Tatiana

Zitat von Lance Nelson <lnelson at SANDIEGO.EDU>:

> Colleagues,
> 
> One of my favorites, though now a tad dated, is the BBC film "The Fourth Stage," which documents the deliberations of a retired Deccan Herald editor as he tries to decide whether he should follow a family tradition and take samnyasa in his old age.  Included is his pilgrimage to Srngeri (where he has an interview the Sankaracarya) and Banaras (where he observes a ritual initiation into samnyasa), as well as a fascinating discussion with his family ("We're all against your idea!).  Now available on DVD. See:
