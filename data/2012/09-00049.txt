hinduism film recommendations
Dear Colleagues, 
Here are two films that I use quite often in the introductory courses I teach on Hinduism : 
The Wages of Action, Religion in a Hindu village, a great film on popular hinduism in a village of Uttar Pradesh. It is easily divided into different section, which is useful when teaching. The classical (and marvelous) Satyajit Ray's Devi, The Godess, that find it very good to illustrate darsana. 
All the best,

Dear colleagues,
sorry if the film "Vari - an Indian Pilgrimage" by the great ethnologist Guenther Sontheimer and Henning Stegmueller (1989 http://www.onlinefilm.org/de_DE/film/51112) has already been mentioned during this exchange of information.
It is one of the most fascinating and moving - in the best sense of the word - documentaries I have ever seen.
Best wishes
Tatiana
