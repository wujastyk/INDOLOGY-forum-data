Query
Dear Patrick,
the problem is not with the Devanagari-QWERTY keyboard but with the font (Tahoma in your case, but Devanagari-MT would work the same). Each font comes with a definite set of glyphs, i.e. graphic representations of characters and ligatures: Tahoma simply doesn't include the graphic ligatures you wish (e.g. a single grapheme for 'g?v-' or '?k-') and for this reason breaks the ligature using the vir?ma.
In other words, when you type devan?gar? the file you create is made up only by the Unicode codes of the basic (=single) characters: whenever ligatures are involved, the way they are graphically represented depends only on the availability of gliyphs in the font you are using.
I'm sorry but I don't know of any font for Mac that includes the ghlyps you mentioned.
Best,
