Manuscript copies of printed books
Two points:
1. I remember that the manuscripts of  ratnakiirti's apohasiddhi.h and/or k.sa.nabhaGgasiddhi.? in the Natioal Archives, Kathmandu, collection are Newari script copies of the texts in Six Buddhist Nyaya Tracts.
2. While it may be necessary to collate printed editions, it may not be required to report their readings in a critical edition, if the editor is confident that the only significant readings are conjectures. The critical editor may eliminate previous editions: if the editor is reasonabally confident that a given editor used manuscripts represented in his or her edition, it should be acceptable to report only the readings in the previous editions that appear to be conjectural. Printed editions whose only contribution is the odd contribution clutter a critical edition's apparatus and make it more difficult for the reader to evaluate the editor's choices.
