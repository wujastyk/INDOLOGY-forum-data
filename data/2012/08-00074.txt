Dear Colleague,

I discover your query only today. I have got a BORI's consent to get  
copies from the IGNCA, a few months ago. I know your concern is  
different, yet you may try to write also to Maitreyee Deshpande, Hon.  
Secretary, BORI, Pune: <deshpandemaitreyee4 at gmail.com>, who has been  
quite helpful in my case.

Best,

Prof. Lyne Bansat-Boudon
