Pingree's 1997 "Astronomy at the Court of Anupasimha," in his *From Astral
Omens* book, Meulenbeld's HIML, etc., all refer to four-digit numbers for
each MS.  If you have the 1940s edition of the catalogue handy, could you
confirm or deny that the earlier catalogue has a completely different
numbering system for MSS?

There's no note about this in the 1993 edition, nor any new prelim material.

Best,
Dominik
