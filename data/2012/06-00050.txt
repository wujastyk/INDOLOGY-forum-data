A copy of the font can be downloaded from here:

   - https://dl.dropbox.com/u/2372616/SantipurOT.ttf

I just wanted it to check it's ligature features.  It's got an appealing
design for anyone raised on Nir?ayas?gara/Lanman type fonts, as does
Sanskrit 2003.

I won't answer any questions about the font, installation, etc.  And it
will disappear from the above location after a while.  I don't want to
tread on the toes of the author of the font, who has his own preferences
about distribution.  Presumably he will update his email address in due
course.

Enjoy,
Dominik
