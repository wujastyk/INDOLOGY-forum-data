As I have already written to Prof. Varakhedi, I am delighted to see this development.  Having read the main page and some articles, however, may I urge that a good font be used which would preclude some of the numerous typographic problems one encounters. There are good Unicode devanagari fonts available that can be used across platforms. Making these available to potential contributors would encourage many of us to take an active apart.  With best wishes for success, George Cardonia

This is, in my view, a very good idea, and much preferable to creating a separate wiki for Sanskrit contributions, that would inevitably become ghettoized.  It will enable Sanskrit language contributors to make use of the substantial writing aids and editorial support and control systems that already exist within the main Wikipedia.  It will also give visibility to Sanskrit as a member of the world family of languages that are important enough to have representation in Wikipedia.

The knowledge that was not preserved in script form was lost to us. Even the physical preservation of manuscripts has become a challenge. Digi-techonlogy has given more life-span to them. Still we need to work on preserving and spreading knowledge systems. The text which did not enter the press-room has not seen the light and yet stays in the dark. The branch of knowledge that did not come to light and was not spread, could not survive for long. The preservation of existing Sanskrit Sahstrik knowledge and their texts is our responsibility. We are accountable for passing on them to the next generation using all means of modern technology. One such technology is wiki-techonology, which is one-stop solution to all problems.
