Sanskrit wiki - participation of scholars - an appeal
As I have already written to Prof. Varakhedi, I am delighted to see this development.  Having read the main page and some articles, however, may I urge that a good font be used which would preclude some of the numerous typographic problems one encounters. There are good Unicode devanagari fonts available that can be used across platforms. Making these available to potential contributors would encourage many of us to take an active apart.  With best wishes for success, George Cardonia
