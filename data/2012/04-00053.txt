The book presents an edition, English translation and study of the Dharma P?ta?jala, a previously unpublished Old Javanese-Sanskrit ?aiva scripture transmitted through a single palm-leaf codex of West Javanese origin dating back to the 15th century AD. 
The cultural and doctrinal background of the text, as well as its codicological and philological aspects, are introduced in Part I. Part II presents an annotated diplomatic edition of the text with facsimile reproductions of the codex on facing pages, followed by a critical edition with English annotated translation. Part III is a systematic study focusing on the interpretation of the doctrines taught in the Dharma P?ta?jala in comparison with related Sanskrit texts from the Indian Subcontinent and Old Javanese scriptures from the Indonesian Archipelago. 
The Dharma P?ta?jala is doubly important: first, because it has been preserved on a codex belonging to a rare tradition of manuscripts from Java, which is significantly older than the majority of Balinese manuscripts containing Old Javanese texts; and second, because it documents an early tradition of speculative texts (Tattva), which was previously known to us only through two Old Javanese scriptures, namely the V?haspatitattva and the Tattvaj??na. The Dharma P?ta?jala thus fills a gap in our knowledge of ?aiva theology and philosophy in pre-Islamic Indonesia, and also casts light on the origin and development of ?aivism in the Indian Subcontinent.
The author of the Dharma P?ta?jala adopted a variety of P?ta?jala (a????ga) yoga instead of the ?aiva (?a?a?ga) yoga that is common in other Old Javanese texts, and attuned it to a ?aiva doctrinal framework. When elaborating his syncretic system, the author seemingly followed a hitherto unknown commentarial tradition to the Sanskrit Yogas?tra that is related, albeit by no means identical, to that of the Yogas?trabh??ya. The Dharma P?ta?jala also documents a variety of non-dualist ?aivism that may be regarded as early Saiddh?ntika in nature, but in which more archaic, pre-Saiddh?ntika (i.e. P??upata) elements have been retained as doctrinal ?fossils?.
