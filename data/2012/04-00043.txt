Dear Colleagues and Friends,

I would like to share some information with you on a new specialist Jaina
library in Bonn which is open to students and scholar wishing to access the
publications, and on a lecture series on Jaina manuscripts organised to
inaugurate this new research centre.

With best wishes,

Julia Hegewald.


PIANAROSA JAINA LIBRARY, Bonn
The Pianarosa Jaina Library is a specialist collection on Jaina art and
architecture, literature, religion and philosophy. Since 2011, it is housed
in a separate room forming an integral part of the library of the Department
of Asian and Islamic Art History at the University of Bonn. The roughly
1,600 scholarly monographs, edited volumes, traditional Jaina ma- nuscripts
and periodicals in European and Indian languages (e.g. Sanskrit, Hindi,
Gujarati, Kannada etc.) were donated by the family of the late Paolo
Pianarosa (1949 - 2010).

Mr Pianarosa, a specialist librarian from Turin (Italy) worked for the
Soprintendenza Beni Librari della Regione Piemonte. He developed an interest
in Jainism, particularly in Karnataka. He started taking private classes in
Sanskrit in 1983 and continued studying the laguge for the next tweve years.
In the early 1980s, Paolo Pianarosa commenced gathering books on Jaina
subjects and from 2001 visited India regularly.

The more than one and a half thousand publications of the original Pianarosa
private collection have been supplemented by additional books on Jaina art
and architecture from the library of the Department of Asian and Islamic Art
History. Further volumes will join the collection from the Gritli von
Mitterwallner bequest (2012).

The aims of the Pianarosa library are to preserve the present collections,
supplement them with further texts on Jainism and provide easy access for
on-site study to scholars wishing to work with the material. The
bibliographic records of
the growing collection are being catalogued. A full list is available via a
link on the departmental webpage (www.aik. uni-bonn.de).

The Pianarosa Library Bonn will be inaugurated with a lecture series by
international scholars from Germany, Italy, Belgium, France and Great
Britain and opened officially with two scientific presentations and a public
reception by the end of June 2012 (please see information below or back of
flyer for further details).

If you would like further information on the work of the Pianarosa Library,
wish to access the publications or would like to make a book gift or
financial donation to aid the running and enlargement of the library, please
contact the Depart- ment of Asian and Islamic Art History
(aikinfo at uni-bonn.de, 0049-228-73 72 12).

We are striving to further enhance the collections and to make the Pianarosa
Library Bonn one of the world?s most comprehensive research and resource
centres for material on Jaina studies.
