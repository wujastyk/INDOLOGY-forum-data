Commentators on the Vishnu Purana
Dear Colleagues,
Are any of you aware of works that take up commentators on the Vishnu
Purana?
I have been asked about commentaries on this text by a student and am
embarrassingly ignorant!
Should anyone have any texts of these commentaries (or references for them,
if printed editions exist), I would also be grateful.
The student reads Sanskrit well.
Thanks in Anticipation,
