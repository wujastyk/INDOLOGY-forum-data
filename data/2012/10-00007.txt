Dear Colleagues,

 

Are any of you aware of works that take up commentators on the Vishnu
Purana?

 

I have been asked about commentaries on this text by a student and am
embarrassingly ignorant!

 

Should anyone have any texts of these commentaries (or references for them,
if printed editions exist), I would also be grateful.

 

The student reads Sanskrit well.

 

Thanks in Anticipation,

 

James Hegarty
