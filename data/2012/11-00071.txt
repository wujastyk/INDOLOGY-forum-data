Jasmine vs. basil
There is a famous Namputiri brahmin household called Svar?attu Ma?a near Kochi. It is supposed to be a 12-ke??u (i.e., it has three courtyards each of which is a n?lu (4)-kettu). According to tradition, ?di ?ankara is supposed to have composed the Kanakadh?r? Stava there. In any case, what I found interesting in the main courtyard is that it has the mullai (jasmine) plant rather than the usual tu?aci (basil) plant. According to Mr. Narayanan Namp?tiri of that household, jasmine is considered more auspicious than basil. This reminded me of the CT usage 'mullai c???a ka?pu' Is this a tradition specific to Kerala? Is this tradition also found in any Sanskrit literary sources?
Thanks in advance
