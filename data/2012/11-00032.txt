Question on Pali syntax
Hello Colleagues,
     I am reading the Mah?satipa??h?nasutta from the D?ghanik?ya with a few
students.  In this Sutta, phrases like atthi k?yo, atthi cittam, atthi
vedan? are quite frequent, and pose no problems.  However, then comes the
phrase atthi dhamm? a few times.  It is quite clear from the context that
dhamm? is nominative plural (other refs in the context in plural: dhammesu
dhamm?nupass?).  I am wondering how to explain the syntax of the phrase
atthi dhamm?.  Any suggestions?  Perhaps, K.R. Norman might have an
explanation.  Does anyone have his email address?  Thanks.
