Terms for Negation ?
Perhaps you might try St. Petersburg with hara. It will be time consuming. There should be other terms like ??a that I do not remember immediately. These terms are taught in primary class arithmetic meaning denominator and minus. al?bha? ?and ?anuccheda? mean no profit and no loss respectively. 
There is a paper in Sanskrit ?V?rt???str?ya? ?ki?cit? ??by Vibh?ti Bh??a?a Bha???c?rya on the accounting system and
market management in Kau?ilya?s
Artha??stra published in
the S?rasavat? su?am? VS 2006 and 2007. The concepts come into
discussion. One may disagree on some points but the paper is informative and
innovative. But I read it in the seventies and cannot accurately tell
everything.

Re: [INDOLOGY] Terms for Negation ?
Dear List,?
A bit tangentially: what is the Sanskrit term for 'liability' (minus-value)??
Could philosophical interest in the idea of "negated reality" ('zero-value', 'lack of existence', 'emptiness')?mirror in any way the development of accounting methods and techniques?
Regards,?
