poets from Bihar?
Dear Colleague,
Vidy?pati
of Mithila ? Vai??ava devotional poems
If k?vya
is meant then one may count 
B??abha??a ? K?dambar? and Har?acarita-- prose romance, Vi??khadatta ? Mudr?r?k?asa -- drama. Eastern UP is culturally akin
to Bihar. This region too produced poets like Vatsabh??i. 
Best

[INDOLOGY] poets from Bihar?
Dear list,
Is anybody aware of Sanskrit poets from the area that is now Bihar? ?I imagine there may have been some well known poets from Pataliputra whose works have survived, and perhaps from other places and periods too.
I would be grateful for any leads or ideas.
Thank you
