Dear All,

I am desperately looking for the original Sanskrit text of the 
Spho?atattvanir?pa?a of ?e?ak???a (or K???a?e?a) and just wondering any of 
you have come across it in the Internet as an e-Text or a scanned PDF or 
possess a copy of it. It will also be great if any of you could kindly give 
me even a hint at a location I could find it as an electronically 
transferable copy. 

Thank you in advance,

Best wishes
Rohana Seneviratne
