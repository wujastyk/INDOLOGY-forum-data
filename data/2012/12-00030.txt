Citation
Friends:
I have what appears to be a citation from a Buddhist work by Medh?tithi, the great commentator of Manu. On Manu 2.6 (Jha's ed. p. 57) he cites: "pa?y?my aha? bhik?ave divyena cak?u?? sugati? durgati? ca."
Jha reads "bhik?????", but this is probably an error. I have emended it following five manuscript readings given in the Gharpure edition.
Thanks for any leads. Best,
Patrick
