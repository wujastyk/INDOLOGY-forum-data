Mangala- title for brahmin physicians
28.4.12
Dear Dr. Palaniappan
I do not know of physicians being called
Ma?gala in North India, but the hymns to the fathers are called Ma?gal?in the Orissa tradition
of the Paippal?da-Sa?hit? of the Atharvaveda.
Those Paippal?da
hymns (AVP 18.57-82) have been termed M??galikas in the ?aunaka-Sa?hit?of the
Atharvaveda (AV? 19.23). The same hymns appear with variants in the ?AV? (18) too but the name Ma?gal?does not appear
for them in this branch. They appear also in the ?gveda and the Taittir?ya ?ra?yaka. Here
too the name Ma?gal?is missing for
them.
If it could be of any help to you, I
request you to note that a relatively elaborate treatment of the origin and
nature of the hymns and of the name Ma?gal? given to them may be found in the Paippal?da-Sa?hit? of
the Atharvaveda Vol. Three, Asiatic Society, (2011), Introduction ?6, pp.lxxxiii
? xc (also ?7, partly). Unfortunately the book has been temporarily
withdrawn from circulation after the detection of some recurrent errors. The
press is expected to rectify the defect in a month when it can again come into
circulation.
Among others, the Mars is Mangala in Indian astrology.
Astrologers, in Bengal at least, make a fuss of any Mangala ?defect? in the
bride whatever that may mean.
?Best
wishes

[INDOLOGY] Mangala- title for brahmin physicians
In Tamil inscriptions, one notices that brahmin physicians are given titles with the first component being maGkala- as in maGkalappEraraiyan2. Is there any ?Sanskrit/Prakrit inscriptions or literary texts that show any physician in north India with the title maGgala-? 
Thanks in advance

S. Palaniappan
