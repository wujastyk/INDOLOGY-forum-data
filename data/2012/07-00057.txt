Dear All,
Thanks to those on and off list for the contact info for Shreenand. I now have three working emails through which I can contact him. Hopefully I will be able to rustle up the manuscript that I need in this way.
Best,BF

> Hello Ben,

>      The email address for BORI that you gave is the old/out-dated address.  Their new address is: bori at dataone.in.  I was in Pune most of June 2012 and been to BORI recently.  I think you can use this email address and direct your message to Bapat.
