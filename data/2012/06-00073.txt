Subject: Hardy on Venkatesa
Message-ID: <161227096598.23782.504590634317119626.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

In his 1979 article in JIP, "The Philosopher as Poet," Friedhelm Hardy states that he is preparing "a full study and translations of Venkatesa's stotras and prabhandhams." Was this ever published? and, if so, where? I can't seem to find anything that fits the bill.

Thanks in advance,

Christian
