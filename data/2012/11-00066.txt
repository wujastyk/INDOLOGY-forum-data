Better Quality Scan of Katre's Intro to Indian Textual Criticism
Greetings to all,
Glad that I could have been of use regarding the scan of Katre's ITC, though I should say that the real thanks go to the anonymous original scanner of the book. 
Luis Gonzalez Reimann has very kindly repackaged it into a more compact size with OCR to do word searches, and so I've uploaded it here-- http://cl.ly/0u0s1Q2W1P0e
Please feel free to download this smaller and more useful version of Katre's ITC instead! 
All best wishes,
