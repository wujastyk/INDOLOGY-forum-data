Death of Prof. Hajime Sakurabe              (=?UTF-8?Q?=E6=AB=BB=E9=83=A8=E5=BB=BA)?=
dear Colleagues,
I just received the very sad news of the passing of Prof. Hajime Sakurabe
(???) on June 8th. I trust that a proper appreciation of this remarkable
scholar (and, as far as I knew him, lovely person) will be published in
short order.
