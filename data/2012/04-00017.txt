PuNDarIka sacrifice
Dear Joerg,
The 11 days of the Braahma.na and ;Srauta-suutra sources (and the 1996
performance in Delhi) which I indicated refer to the sutyaa-days
(Soma-pressing days) of the Pau.n.dariika and does not count the
preparatory days (those on which the Diik.saa, Pravargya-Upasad etc. take
place).
Best, Jan
