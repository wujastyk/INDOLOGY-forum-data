Manuscript copies of printed books
Dear Emmanuel,
It is not exactly the same thing, but perhaps also of interest: One of the
??rad? manuscripts of Mahe?var?nanda's Mah?rthama?jar? which I collated for
the specimen edition in my PhD thesis contained a considerable number of
marginal annotations in a second ??rad? hand.  That same hand, however,
'corrected'  the ms. to bring it in line with the readings of Ganapati
Sastri's 1918 edition of the text in the Trivandrum Sanskrit Series.  Since
he blotted out the original readings, and since the northern and southern
versions of the MM represent two very distinct recensions, this annotator
inadvertently obliterated all of this ms.'s value as an independent
witness, producing a hybrid Northern-Southern (and print-manuscript)
version in the process,
Best,
Whitney
