Manuscript copies of printed books
Among Tibetan materials one frequently encounters
manuscripts that were copied from xylographic prints.
The difficulty and cost of arranging for prints to
be struck from the blocks often meant that it was
both easier and more cost effective to prepare hand
copies.
