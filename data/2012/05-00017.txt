*Epigraphical Evidence for the Formation and Rise of Early ?aivism*
*The Religious Landscape at the time of the Composition and Spread of 
the /Skandapur??a/*
Towards the end of the Gupta-V?k??aka period, religious sectarian 
movements started to feature prominently in the political landscape of 
early medieval India (ca. 400 - 900 CE). One of the most dominant 
religious traditions in this period is ?aivism, revolving around the 
worship of the god ?iva. Its propagators developed strong ties to royal 
houses and grew to be successful in establishing a range of religious 
institutions under its authority throughout the Indianized world, as 
recently laid out in Sanderson's seminal work 'The ?aiva Age' (2009). 
The theology, mythology and ritual codes of the various branches of 
?aivism are recorded in an array of textual material but the most 
important sources for assessing their historical reality on the ground 
are contained in the epigraphical corpus. These traces of institutional 
activities often long predate our extant textual evidence.
The contributors of the symposium will present religious epigraphical 
data on early forms of ?aivism and its competitors pertaining to its 
formative period in India, Nepal, Cambodia and Camp?. These data will be 
contextualized and correlated with the political history and findings 
from the study of the religious textual corpus. Insights generated in 
this symposium aim to contribute towards a more differentiated 
understanding of the historical and social reality of these religious 
traditions themselves, as well as of the religious milieu and 
socio-political dynamics which facilitated the creation and 
dissemination of a large body of religious scriptures. One important 
example of such a scripture is the oldest extant version of the 
/Skandapur??a/, which is our earliest evidence of a systematization of 
?iva mythology and contains the earliest extant origination myths of the 
?aiva P??upata tradition, the precursor of the various forms of Tantric 
?aivism. By linking epigraphical material with such textual evidence and 
/vice versa/, we hope to shed more light on the religious developments 
in this transitional period from the classical to the medieval.
