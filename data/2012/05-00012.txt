Kapadia ashvamedha article
Dear colleagues,
I wonder whether anyone is in a position to send me a PDF of the following article:
B. H. Kapadia, 'Asvamedha, the King of Sacrifices', in the Journal of the University of Bombay, vol. 30, part 2 (1961).
I would be very grateful! 
Yours faithfully,
Simon Brodbeck
