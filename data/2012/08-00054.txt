I am in need of a PDF article for a colleague who needs it very quickly (faster than our inter-library loan service can get it for him).  If someone has a PDF of the following, I would be much obliged.

Herman Kulke, ?The Historical Background of India?s Axial Age.? In The Origins and Diversity of Axial Age Civilizations, ed. S.N. Eisenstadt, 374-392 (Albany: SUNY Press, 1986).

 My best,

Steven
