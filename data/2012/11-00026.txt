Current advice on Intro Sanskrit programmes
Dear Colleagues, 
I'm writing to ask for current advice for English-medium programmes in introductory Sanskrit. The programme could be a regular semester programme, or a summer intensive. 
I would be especially grateful for recommendations of institutions based in Canada, Europe, Asia-Pacific (India / Nepal / Thailand / Sri Lanka?) that would be relatively affordable. 
If colleagues wish to reply to me off-list, I would be glad to collate responses and post a summary (sasamp at nus.edu.sg).
With many thanks in advance for your help, 
Andrea
