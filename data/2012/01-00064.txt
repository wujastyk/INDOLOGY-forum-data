jIvanmRta and jIvanmukta
Dear all,
A colleague who does not subscribe to this list has asked me to pass on the following query:
Are there any studies that discuss the notion of jIvanmRta (though not necessarily focussed on that term), or any work in which one can find a comparison between jIvanmRta and jIvanmukta?
Many thanks and regards,
Christian Coseru
