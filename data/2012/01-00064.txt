Dear all,

A colleague who does not subscribe to this list has asked me to pass on the following query:

Are there any studies that discuss the notion of jIvanmRta (though not necessarily focussed on that term), or any work in which one can find a comparison between jIvanmRta and jIvanmukta?


Many thanks and regards,
Christian Coseru
