Subject: R. S. Bhattacharya on commentarial writing
Message-ID: <161227095496.23782.9982664312347693173.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear List members,

At several points in his brief and interesting article "Use of Manuscripts
in Textual Criticism by our Commentators" (in V.V. Dwivedi and Janardan
Pandey, ed. Samp?dana ke Siddh?nta aur Up?d?na, Sarnath: CIHTS, 1990), Ram
Shankar Bhattacharya refers to his own forthcoming book-length study on the
same subject.  Do any of you know if this project was ever completed, and,
if so, its publication details?

Thanks in advance,

Whitney
