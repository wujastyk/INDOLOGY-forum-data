Subject: South Asia Archive?
Message-ID: <161227096849.23782.739970155913595037.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Routledge is selling an online archive of mostly Bengal-related digitized
source materials:

   - http://www.southasiaarchive.com/

Does anyone have experience with this?  If so, could you give us a
thumbnail sketch or opinion?

Many thanks,

Dominik Wujastyk
