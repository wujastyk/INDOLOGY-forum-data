Dear Members of the List,
In 1883, B?hler edited and translated an inscription found in the N?n?gh?t cave (Andhra Pradesh) in the Archaeological Survey of Western India, Vol. V, pp. 59?74.
On the basis of epigraphic evidence, B?hler concluded that this inscription was incised between 200 and 150 BC (op. cit. p. 73).
Has this dating been challenged since?
Also, has any secondary literature on this inscription been produced after B?hler's paper and where can I find it?
Many thanks in advance,
