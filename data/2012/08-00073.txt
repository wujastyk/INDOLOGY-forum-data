Ordering Bori mss in microfilm
Hello Everyone,
Just to clarify that Maitreyi Deshpande is no longer the Hon. Secretary of
BORI.  She has been replaced a few months ago by Mr. Arun Barve.  For the
changes that have occurred, take a look at the following news report:

I was in Pune in June for three weeks and gave a talk at the BORI, but did
not see Maitreyi Deshpande.  I would suggest that you write to Mr. Arun
Barve who is now the Hon. Secretary.
