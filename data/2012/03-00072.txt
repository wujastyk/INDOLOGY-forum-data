Sanskrit Search Engine: Up again
Dear all,
Thank you for your patience. There was some technical problem in the server.
Now the server is restored back.
Since the bandwidth is low, we have also disabled some of the features.
We will be back with them, soon.
Sorry for the inconvenience.
With regards,
Amba Kulkarni
