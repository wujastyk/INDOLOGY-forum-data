Hindu idea of "hidden" verses in heaven
Just a marginal addition: a comparable idea is also found in  
P??car?tra and in Vi?i???dvaita, when it is claimed that there  
used to be a single original Veda (ek?yanaveda), of which we only  
possess fragments. Some texts claim to be fragments of this  
ek?yanaveda and the whole theory probably aims at claiming a Vedic  
status for the P??car?tra (Marzenna Czerniak-Dro?d?owicz spoke  
about the ek?yanaveda in the last WSC).
The ek?yanaveda-theory  is sometimes found in connection with the  
Pr?bh?kara M?m??s? claim that beside the Veda we know there is  
another Veda which is nity?numeya (always only inferable [through  
other works which are too good not to be rooted in the Veda]). Since  
this is only inferable, it does not exist as such in heaven or in any  
other "world".
