Vajra sources
Dear All:
I am having problems tracking down several articles and rejoinders (?) 
on the vajra. My interlibrary loan people need the correct vol. and year 
of the two listed below (as the vols and years do not match, see below). 
Can someone help? Does anyone simply have pdfs they can send me?
Journal Title: Orbis
Article Title: Erwiderung auf B. Schlerath
Article Author: Rau, Wilhelm
Vol.: 25     Issue:
Month:     Pages: 356-358  Year: 1976
TN: 378194
Journal Title: Orbis
Article Title: Nachtrag zu vajra
Article Author: Schlerath, Bernfried
Vol.: 26     Issue:
Month:     Pages: 133-134  Year: 1977
TN: 378195
Also we are having problems getting hold of the following as well: Rau's 
Metalle und Metallgeraete...(1976), Das Gupta's Der Vajra (1975), and 
Schlerath's Vedisch vajra. Orbis 24 1975. Does anyone have pdfs of these?
Cheers again
