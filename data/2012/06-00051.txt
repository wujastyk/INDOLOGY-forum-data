A copy of the font can be downloaded from here:

  *   https://dl.dropbox.com/u/2372616/SantipurOT.ttf

I just wanted it to check it's ligature features.  It's got an appealing design for anyone raised on Nir?ayas?gara/Lanman type fonts, as does Sanskrit 2003.

I won't answer any questions about the font, installation, etc.  And it will disappear from the above location after a while.  I don't want to tread on the toes of the author of the font, who has his own preferences about distribution.  Presumably he will update his email address in due course.

Enjoy,
Dominik

If anyone has this font, would they be so kind as to send me a copy?  The email address given at http://www.scsmath.narod.ru/6ot/ot.htm
doesn't work.

I'm after Shantipur OT, not Shantipur 99.

Many thanks,
