Dear Dominik,

Somehow my message below does not seem to have appeared on the Indology
Liverpool forum. Will you kindly post it for me? Thanks and best wishes. --

On 2012-09-14, Remmer, Ulla <Ulla.Remmer at assoc.oeaw.ac.at> asked:

>can anybody help me with a translation of the following text? We have an
old recording of this song here in the Phonogramm-Archiv of Vienna. It was
recorded in 1905 in Varanasi and sung by Madhus?dan Ke?ava Jo??. On the
protocol it is described as "Maratti-Song". But is it Marathi at all?<

The language is definitely Marathi (full of Skt words). The transcription
needs to be improved, especially in the area of separating the words. I
suggest the improvements I can easily think of. For others, the original
musst be heard and the context must be known, and one must have more time
(which I do not have at present).

The transcription provided:

avalo kita madhum?sa nava?r? yetamah??vet?h?

ha?sakanyak? savesakh?ccya h?sata bolata k??h???
                         tijal? maini?at? s??gej? ?nakopudartiva

I would suggest:
 avalokita madhu-m?sa-nava?r? yeta mah??vet? h?
 "Observing the fresh beauty of the month of Caitra, here comes Mahaa-;svetaa
(or resplendently fair/white as an adjective of the next word)

ha?sakanyak? save sakh?cya h?sata bolata k??h???
 The daughter of Ha.msa (or a swan), along with (her) friends, laughing (or
smiling)  and saying something
                        tijal? maini?at? [= maitri.na tii ?] s??ge j?.una
kopudartiva [= ?]
 Going near her, the friend [?] conveys xxx

If Mahaa-;svetaa is used as a proper name, the song may have something to
do with the story in Baa.na's Kaadambarii.

As I recall, there was an opera composed by Mr. Govinda-r?o .Tembe
titled Mahaa-;svetaa,
but I do not know if it is as old as 1905.
