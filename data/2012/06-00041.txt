Sinhala ligatures
Dear Professor Karp,
I happen to have been doing some limited research on digital Sinhala
script just last week (I was writing a Sinhala <-> Roman
transliterator), and I think the following may be of help to you:

As you know, there are several different kinds of ligatures in Sinhala
script, and to get them to be displayed in a given environment requires
three things:
1) font support (the font must contain the necessary graphemes and
glyphs, and must have the necessary ligature tables);
2) software support (the rendering engine of the software platform you
are using must invoke and apply the correct ligature substitutions); and
3) the ak?aras you're using must be encoded correctly.
Since many (I think all?) of the fonts you mention can do at least the
non-vocalic -y (ya?saya ????) and -r (rak?r??saya ????????) strokes (and
the rendering engines of modern word-processors shouldn't be a problem),
I think you might not have correctly encoded ak?aras.
The problem is that many ligatures in Sinhala script are optional, and
so the Unicode standard for Sinhala is capable of representing different
forms.  Generally, you need to add the Unicode "Zero Width Joiner" (ZWJ,
U+200D) in the right place (usually after the Sinhala vir?ma, aka hal
kir?ma or al-lakuna, U+0DCA) to specify that you want the rendering
engine to render the ligature form, if its available in the font.
Standard combining ligatures (b?n?di akuru ???? ?????), including r-
(repaya), are optional and few of them are commonly used in modern
Sinhalese, as I understand it.  As such, in the absence of the ZWJ after
the vir?ma they will be rendered with the explicit vir?ma visible
(although if this is intentional, the use of an explicit ZWNJ, U+200C,
is strongly recommended by Unicode PR-96[1]).  I think this is what you
must be seeing?

"Touching" ligatures (spar?a akuru ??????? ?????), which I believe are
only found in classical and Buddhist texts, are specified by placing the
ZWJ _before_ the vir?ma.
I created a document showing a range of different kinds of ligatures,
how they are constructed in Unicode, and how they are rendered by
different fonts.  You can take a look here:

The only freely-available font I could find which renders all of them
"correctly" is BhashitaComplex, which you can get from here:
http://www.locallanguages.lk/sinhala_unicode_converters
and the most useful documentation on Unicode Sinhala I could find last
week was this document:
http://www.siyabas.lk/files/Sri_Lanka_Standard_Sinhala_Character_Code_for_Information_Interchange_SLS_1134_-_2004.pdf

Disclaimer:  I don't really read Sinhala script (and certainly not
Sinhalese), and this information took a whole afternoon to track down
and assemble from different sources, so I would appreciate corrections,
clarifications or comments!
I hope this information is useful to you.
Take care,
simon
