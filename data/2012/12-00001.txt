Dear colleagues,

we are happy to announce the last of three volumes on Hindu- and Buddhist life-cycle rituals among the Newars in Nepal, published in Ethno-Indology - Heidelberg Studies in South Asian Rituals series by Harrassowitz. The volumes contain descriptions and analysis of all major rites de passage along with the edition and translation of many related ritual handbooks as well as a DVD. To my knowledge it is the first time that all the major samskaras have been studied at one place, in one community and in a way that combines fieldwork with philology. The project that is financed by the DFG started in 2002 will come to an end in the next year.
