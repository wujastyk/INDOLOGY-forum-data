Release of Sanskrit Heritage Engine system as freeware
Dear list,
at the occasion of the 15th World Sanskrit Conference, I am happy to announce the first release of the Sanskrit Heritage Engine system as open source freeware (under LGPL license).
This set of Web services may be installed on Linux and other UNIX-based systems such as Mac OSX.
You will need an HTTP server on the host machine, such as Apache. 
You also need to install the OCaml programming environment, freely available at http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/index.en.html
(click on "Latest OCaml release").
The compressed tar archive (20.6Mo) may be downloaded as: http://sanskrit.inria.fr/DISTR/SktEngine.260.tar.gz
It contains installation and configuration instructions. 
With my best wishes for the New Year,
Yours truly
G?rard Huet
