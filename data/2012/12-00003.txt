Dear colleagues,

in case you are considering to visit Rome for Christmas, here is an additional reason for doing it:


A Coffee Break Conference on the quotations and re-use of texts in Sanskrit ??stra.
Rome, Institute of Oriental Studies 21-22 December 2012

The Coffee Break Conference (CBC) project is the result of a larger reflection on the common sensical statement that "the most interesting parts of a conference are the coffee breaks". One yawns or falls asleep while most papers are read ? apart from a couple of them and one's own one. By contrast, one often takes part of challenging and fascinating debates while sipping at a cup of tea or coffee. Often, the same papers sound thought-provoking and insightful during the breaks, and extremely boring while they are actually read. Therefore, what a "coffee break conference" aims at is to leave behind the rigidity and formality of the official academic and scholarly meetings and to favour an open-minded exchange of ideas, suggestions, discussions and criticisms, within the spirit of a friendly dialogue held in an informal atmosphere.

Provisional programme:
