Sanskrit kaThina 'hard, firm, stiff' indeed goes back to the Dravidian  
root *kaNTTu (whence Tamil kaTTu etc.) 'to harden, consolidate,  
congeal, coagulate, swell (as boil or tumour)', derivatives including  
i.a. Tamil kaTTi 'clod, lump, concretion, anything hardened,  
coagulated, boil, abscess, tumour, enlarged spleen, foetus'. Cognates  
in other languages are not recorded as having the meaning 'foetus',  
but the basic meaning is  anything becoming hard or solid like milk  
coagulating into solid lumps of butter etc.  The etymon is distributed  
widely in the Dravidian languages, all main branches being  
represented. See T. Burrow & M. B. Emeneau, A Dravidian etymological  
dictionary, second edition, Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1984, no. 1148 on  
pages 108-109.
