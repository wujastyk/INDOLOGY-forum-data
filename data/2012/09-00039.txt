The idea of a list of such films is an excellent one.

A wonderful classic is "The God with a Green Face" which centers upon a
Kathakali performance of the Ramayana in Kerala. Besides providing many
insights into the training and techniques of this performance tradition,
the film provides one of the most compelling representations of bhakti on
the visual record, especially in the look on the face of the young tabla
player in the course of the performance. Unfortunately, copies of the film
are now scarce (and in bad shape) and something needs to be done to
digitize a decent copy before they have all disappeared. (Sorry to say I do
not have one.) Many years ago I successfully tracked down the man who made
the film, but he had no copies and no longer knew where any might be.
