Indian philosophy as philosophy
Dear indologists-philosophers,
While working at the Institute of philosophy I often come across europeocentrism as well as the arrogance of those of my colleagues who believe that philosophy is an exclusively Western phenomenon.  To make them change their mind or, at least, cast a glance beyond their horizon I have developed a number of apologetic arguments for Indian philosophy as a philosophy in its own right. Those who are interested may read the text of my lecture to a non-indological audience which is attached to this letter. I would like to suggest to those who have something to say on this subject to make a special issue of some journal (it is for you to decide which one).
With best regards,
