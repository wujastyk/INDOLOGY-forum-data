Games
Dear Dipak Bhattacharya, dear Jean?Michel Delire,
from the looks of the Nasik board, that would be the game known in
Hindi and Nepali as B?gh C?l. Turner?s CDIAL has an entry for it:
   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagh-Chal
What is the Bengali term for the game?
Maybe there is hope. The Wikipedia page for B?gh C?l
   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagh-Chal
lists quite a number of computer versions of the game ? including
one for the iPhone. Do we have a good date for the Nasik board (or
any other information on how far back this game goes)?
All best,
