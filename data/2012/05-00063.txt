Buddhism Across Boundaries
It is certainly not a secret, but it might bear repeating that the papers
in this very welcome volume were delivered in 1993. A number of technical
problems marred the first issue, which was also almost impossible to get
(and given its first title "Collection of Essays" [!!] is also almost
impossible to find in databases). Thus this is all the more welcome.
However, the papers have not been updated (which given the speed things
move in our field might not be crucial). Nevertheless: Caveat lector.
