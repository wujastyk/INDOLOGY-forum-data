Ramayana
Dear Prof. Dehejia,
"ayana" means "going", "advancing", etc. 
Thus, "Ramayana" can be translated as "Rama's journey".

[INDOLOGY] Ramayana
Friends~
What is the meanog of the word 'ayana' as in Ramayana?
The dicitonary defines ayana as: disposition, character etc.
Does this meaning apply to Ramayana namely the character of Rama?
Kind regards.
