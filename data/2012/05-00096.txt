Dear Prof. Dehejia,

"ayana" means "going", "advancing", etc. 

Thus, "Ramayana" can be translated as "Rama's journey".

Friends~

What is the meanog of the word 'ayana' as in Ramayana?

The dicitonary defines ayana as: disposition, character etc.

Does this meaning apply to Ramayana namely the character of Rama?

Kind regards.
