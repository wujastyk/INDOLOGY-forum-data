Sad announcement: Passing of Prof Tilmann Vetter (1937-2012)
Dear Jonathan, 
Let me add my deep condolences to all at Leiden and Wassenaar at the indeed shocking news of Tilman Vetter's passing. 
Tilman and I have closely worked together (such as in a joint class on the Brhad Aranyaka Upanisad) during my nearly 9 years at Leiden.
He also was my close and always helpful neighbor, two houses down, at Wassenaar.
He will be missed by all serious students of Indian philosophy.
