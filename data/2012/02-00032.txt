font]<http://track.brill.nl/y.z?l=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.brill.nl%2Fbrill-typeface&e=5614&j=270225034&t=h>After
careful consideration, Brill has taken the initiative of designing a
typeface. Named ?the Brill?, the new typeface  presents complete coverage
of the Latin script with the full range of diacritics and linguistics (IPA)
characters used to display any language from any period correctly, and
Greek and Cyrillic are also covered. There are over 5,100 characters in
total, some of which are combining characters, and by using these, myriads
of other characters with diacritics can be generated. This indispensable
tool for scholars is now freely available for non-commercial use. You can
download the font package on
brill.nl/brill-typeface<http://track.brill.nl/y.z?l=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.brill.nl%2Fbrill-typeface&e=5614&j=270225034&t=h&p=2>
 after agreeing to the EndUser License Agreement. ?The Brill? is available
now in roman and italic styles, and bold and bold italic will be released
at a later stage. The typeface contains all necessary punctuation marks and
a wide assortment of symbols. It will be especially welcomed by humanities
scholars quoting from texts in any language, ancient or modern.""The Brill"
complies with all international and web standards, the most important of
which is the Unicode Standard."John Hudson of Tiro Typeworks, well-known
for his multilingual fonts, is "the Brill"'s designer.You can download the
font on our website
