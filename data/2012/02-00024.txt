Message-ID: <161227095142.23782.2494029795418395569.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I should like to enquire if someone has a copy of the edition of the Kuvalayama?la? by Uddyotana-suuri, i.e,  vol. 1 of the Bharatiya Vidya Bhava edition from 1959. I should greatly appreciate it if I could be directed to a website where it can be download, or if some could provide me with a pdf. version.
Many thanks,
Ken
