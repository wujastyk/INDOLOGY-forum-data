Asia as seen through the Sanskrit manuscript collections of the University

funded by the UK Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC), I am pleased
to announce the release of the first batch of catalogue records and digital
images of South Asian manuscripts, which you can find at the following

The next release will be in the autumn. In the meantime, we look forward to
