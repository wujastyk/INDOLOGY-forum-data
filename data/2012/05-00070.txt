Sanskrit proverb?
?Yesterday is but today's memory and tomorrow is today's dream.? Khalil Gibran, The Prophet.
I can't bear to read through the whole text to check for the longer version of this thought which has been posted, but it does sound like either Khalil Gibran or an imitator (parodist?).
Richard Gombrich
