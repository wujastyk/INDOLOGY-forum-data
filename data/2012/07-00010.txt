In my earlier post, the name 'Tirucci??ampalaccaturvetima?kalam' should actually read 'Tirucci??ampalaccaturvetima?kalam'. I regret the typographical error.

PARPOLA 1984)." (Unfortunately the reference PARPOLA 1984 seems to be missing.)

Earlier inscriptions only mention the brahmadeyam Ti??aiku?i aka  Tirucci??ampalaccaturvetima?kalam (or its variants). The earlier inscriptions cover several C??a and P???iya inscriptions.  It was probably Viruppa??a who renamed Ti??aku?i as Vidy?ra?yapuram in honor of the M?dhava-Vidy?ra?ya.  For a long time I had assumed Vasis?t?hakut?i  was a slightly earlier awkward attempt at Sanskritization of Tamil Ti??aiku?i. After all the earlier inscriptions could have rendered the name Vasis?t?hakut?i since these inscriptions used a mixture of both Tamil and Grantha script characters. I cannot think of any reason why the inscriptions would not have used the name Vasis?t?hakut?i.
