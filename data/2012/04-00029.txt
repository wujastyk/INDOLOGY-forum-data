Subject: PuNDarIka sacrifice
Message-ID: <161227095912.23782.8435021012970024393.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

In the fragmentary Nanaghat inscription of a Satavahana queen, which lists 
numerous yajn~a and the accompanying daks.in.aa-s, line 9, after a break, 
begins:  ...riko yam.n~o. I guess this must be another reference to the 
Pun.d.ariika sacrifice.,
References: Bu:hler, Archaeological Survey of Western India, v.5, p. 60; 
D.C. Sircar, Select Inscriptions I, p. 194; further refs. on p. 192. Perhaps 
Sircar mentions this in "Studies..." (cited below), as I don't have a copy 
at hand, but he doesn't note it in Select Inscriptions.

The Badami inscription noted below refers only to "as'vadedhaadiyajn~aanaam 
yajvaa," not to the Pun.d.ariika specifically.

Dear Fran?ois,
In his Studies in the Religious Life of Ancient and Medieval India (Delhi
1971), D.C. Sircar mentions at least once a Pau.n.dariika sacrifice (pp.
177-178). Sircar refers to Pulake'sin I, the Caalukya king of Baadaami,
who is "credited with the performance of the Agni.s.toma, Agnicayana,
Vaajapeya, Bahusuvar.na, Pau.n.dariika and A'svamedha sacrifices and the
Hira.nyagarbha-mahaadaana." Among his sources, Sircar refers to Epigraphia
Indica XXVII, p. 8.
Best,
Vincent Eltschinger
