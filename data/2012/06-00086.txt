Dear Arlo,
On page 83 of the article, the name of the king is ?r? M?ra. Has not somebody already noted the connection between this name and the name M??a? of Tamil P???iya dynasty? (I am unable to recall the reference.) A P???iya king Mu?a-t-Tiru M??a? has authored two Classical Tamil poems. The Sanskrit form of Tiru M??a? will be ?r? M?ra. The name of a a later P???iya king was ?r? M?ra ?r?vallabha?. 
According to R. C. Majumdar (Study of Sanskrit in South-East Asia, p. 25), a Sanskrit inscription was discovered in a place called Vat Luong Kau dated to be of the second half of 5th century AD. "It begins with an invocation to Brahm?, Vi??u and ?iva and then refers to the great king (mahar?j?dhir?ja) ?rI Dev?n?ka and compares him with Yudhi??hira, Indra, DhanaJjaya, Indradyumna, ?ibi, Mah?puru?a, Kanakap???ya(?), the great Ocean and Meru."
Has the possible P???iya connection to Southeast Asia been explored by scholars after K. K. Sarkar?
Thanks
Regards,
Palaniappan
