Sanskrit onomastics
Dear colleagues,
Does anyone have a good text on Sanskrit onomastics? I?ve been trying to
have a clear understanding of such name variations as in the case of
Bhartr-hari (Hari, Hari-vrsabha), if the parts bhartr and vrsabha are surely
or questionably no more than honorific appendices.
