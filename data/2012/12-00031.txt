Citation
Sorry to bug you. But one more question. Just after this citation, Medh?tithi refers to a group of non-Vedic sects -- P??car?trika, Nirgrantha, and P??upata. But in the middle there is a group referred to as "an?rthav?da" OR "?n?rthav?da" (the external sandhi makes it impossible to decide). Has any one see a reference to this or know what this group may have been? 
The Poona Dictionary is not very helpful. It gives the reading "anarthav?da" and says "one of the heterodox sects (lit. having senseless deliberations)!!!
Thanks.

Friends:
I have what appears to be a citation from a Buddhist work by Medh?tithi, the great commentator of Manu. On Manu 2.6 (Jha's ed. p. 57) he cites: "pa?y?my aha? bhik?ave divyena cak?u?? sugati? durgati? ca."
Jha reads "bhik?????", but this is probably an error. I have emended it following five manuscript readings given in the Gharpure edition.
Thanks for any leads. Best,
Patrick
