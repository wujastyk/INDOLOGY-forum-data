I have retired and use either alanus1216 at yahoo.com or allen.w.thrasher at gmail.com.? Our AOC recommended gmail but I am now worried about Google's privacy policies and wonder if I should disassociate myself from it.? But for the time being use either.


Allen

Does anyone have contact information for Allen Thrasher?
