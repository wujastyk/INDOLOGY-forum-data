Joint Letters
Dear all,
A few attestations of k??a, k???k?ara, k??ab?ja are mentioned in volume 2 of the T?ntrik?bhidh?nako?a.
Another term that has not been mentioned in this discussion is pi??a/pi???k?ara.  This too is an old tantric usage, but it is not restricted to tantric literature, for we find it also in V?mana?s K?vy?la?k?ras?tra (4.1.7) and in some anonymous verses he quotes in his auto-commentary.  Now the word pi??a clearly does refer to things having being lumped together, and so such usages suggest that the same idea of ?heaping or lumping together" might indeed be at the root of k??a, k???k?ara, etc.
Today, the expression most commonly heard is perhaps sa?yukt?k?ara, which may sound as though it might have been a calque upon ?conjunct letters" or the like, but it is in fact some centuries old (it is used, for instance, in the K?madhenu commentary on the K?vy?la?k?ras?tra).
