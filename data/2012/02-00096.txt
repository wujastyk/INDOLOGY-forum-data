So sorry to learn of his passing.

Years ago when I was a grad student presenting one of my first conference papers, and no doubt doing so with a great deal of trepidation, Prof. Staal was kind enough to spend some time with me afterwards suggesting future directions for that particular project.  So very kind of him to take the time with a student like that.
