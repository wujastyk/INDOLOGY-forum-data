=?utf-8?Q?Trouble_finding_an_Advaita_=C5=9Bloka?=
Dear All,
I am having trouble locating a quote which the M?dhva thinker Jayat?rtha mentions in his commentary on Madhva's Up?dhikha??ana. The well-known quote is clearly from an Advaitin source, and I am almost certain it is Vimukt?tman's I??asiddhi. It reads as follows:
durgha?atva? avidy?y? bh??a?a? na tu d??a?a?
katha?cid gha?am?natve, 'vidy?tva? durgha?a? bhavet
If anyone knows precisely where this quote comes from, I would be most grateful for the details.
Thanks and best wishes,
Michael Williams
