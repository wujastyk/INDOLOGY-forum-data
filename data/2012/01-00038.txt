The sa?hit? does not provide explicit formulation with regard to the  
equinoxes and solstices, although there are scanty references to the  
seasons. The details are given in Ved??ga-jyoti?a which comes in  
rc and yajur recensions, although according to Pingree this work could  
be quite late (c 400 BC). You shall find discussion on this topic in  
the following works:
Kuppanna Sastry, T S, K V Sarma, and Lagadha. 1985. Ved??ga
