manuscript library in Patan
Respected scholars,
I'm trying to trace 2 manuscripts, the library origin of which is indicated
in a recent edition of the text as "Hemcandra Lahera Bhai Vakil, Patan" and
"Hemcandra, Sree Sangh Jain; Patan" respectively.
I would be immensely thankful for any help locating and, if possible,
contacting the concerned library (libraries?).
Thanks a lot in advance,
sincerely
Andrey Klebanov
