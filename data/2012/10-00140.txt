Improvements on La Tex?
Dear Jonathan and others,
Many critical editors now use the recently updated LaTeX package "eledmac" along with XeLaTeX to be able to typeset with Mac fonts.  Here are a few useful links:
The package itself:  <http://www.ctan.org/pkg/eledmac>
The users listserv:   <https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/ledmac-users>
The list archive:       <https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/ledmac-users/>
Many useful posts: <http://cikitsa.blogspot.com/search/label/XeLaTeX>

Dear All,
I use Mac and I've started to work with La Tex for the purpose of noting variants in texts.  I find La Tex a bit non-user-friendly, and I'm wondering if someone could recommend a good website for Indologist, Sinologist, etc. who are making critical editions, or (preferably) if anyone knows a better program that will allow for multiple footnote bars, margin notes, etc.
Sincerely,
Jonathan Edelmann
