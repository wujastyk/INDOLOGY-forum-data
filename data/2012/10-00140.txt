Dear Jonathan and others,

Many critical editors now use the recently updated LaTeX package "eledmac" along with XeLaTeX to be able to typeset with Mac fonts.  Here are a few useful links:

The package itself:  <http://www.ctan.org/pkg/eledmac>
The users listserv:   <https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/ledmac-users>
The list archive:       <https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/ledmac-users/>
Many useful posts: <http://cikitsa.blogspot.com/search/label/XeLaTeX>
Some sample files: <http://www.garudam.info/category/xetexledmac/>
Many useful tips:    <http://www.djdekker.net/ledmac/>

Best of luck,

Dear All,

I use Mac and I've started to work with La Tex for the purpose of noting variants in texts.  I find La Tex a bit non-user-friendly, and I'm wondering if someone could recommend a good website for Indologist, Sinologist, etc. who are making critical editions, or (preferably) if anyone knows a better program that will allow for multiple footnote bars, margin notes, etc.

Sincerely,
Jonathan Edelmann
