A Query re the development of garbha
murch/m?rch meaning "congeal" is also common in rasa??stra literature,
where m?rcchana (various spellings) is one of the standard eighteen
sa?sk?ras or operations performed on chemical substances.  See, e.g., *
Rasaratnasamuccaya* chapter 11, vv. 15 ff.
P. C. Ray did not know this, and translates m?rch- as "swoon" throughout
his foundational "A History of Hindu Chemistry".
