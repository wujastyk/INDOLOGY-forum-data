A Query re the development of garbha
Dear Colleagues,
my thanks to All for useful bibliographical pointers on the use of
expressions related to "thickening, congealing, solidifying", such as
ka?hina, ghana, m?rch - as used in texts describing both the stages of
embryonic development and (as I am informed by my colleague, Dr.
Joanna Jurewicz) the stages of cosmogony.
The Buddhist Agga??a-sutta (DN, XXVII) contains in its description of
the evolution of the universe phrases drawing, it seems, on quite
widespread concepts of cosmogonical process.
"[...] ras? pa?hav? udakasmi? samat?ni seyyath?pi n?ma payaso tattassa
nibb?yam?nassa upari sant?naka? hoti, eva meva kho s? p?turahosi.
[...] Seyyath?pi n?ma sampanna? v? sappi sampanna? v? navan?ta? [...]"
(6).
"[...] earth with it savour was spread out in the waters. Even as scum
forms on the surface of boiled milky rice that is cooling, so did the
earth appear. [...] Even as well made ghee, or pure butter [...]".
(transl. T.W. and C.A.F. Rhys Davids, Dialogues of the Buddha, Vol.
III, Motilal Banarsidass Publishers, Delhi 2007 [reprint ed.], p. 82)
 Are the comparisons to coagulated milk (sant?naka), ghee (sappi) and
fresh butter (navan?ta), to be found in the descriptions of embryonic
processes?
Best,
Artur Karp
