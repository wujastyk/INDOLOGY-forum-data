Help with Gundert's Malayalam dictionary
Dear Indologists,
The online Malayalam Dictionary by Gundert at the following site does not seem to have the pages proving the key to abbreviations. 
http://dsal.uchicago.edu/dictionaries/gundert/
I would appreciate very much if someone could send me offline a scan of the pages with the key.
Thanks in advance
Regards,
Palaniappan
