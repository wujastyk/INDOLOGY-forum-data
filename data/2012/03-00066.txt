Manuscript copies of printed books
Dear Emmanuel, dear list,
I am aware of a couple of manuscript transcriptions of editions of ?aiva Sanskrit works that were printed a century or so ago in Grantha script.
The e-text of the Kriy?kramadyotik? of Aghora?iva, for example, that is downloadable from the Muktabodha site records that it was copied from an incomplete Devan?gari transcript (kindly furnished by Richard Davis) of the Grantha edition of the 1920s.  There is a similarly partial (but still huge) Devan?gar? transcription of the Grantha-script edition of the Pau?karav?tti of Um?pati?iva (of which I have somewhere a photocopy thanks to the kindness of Juergen Hanneder and Jayandra Soni).
In these cases too, I suppose, the editions could not be purchased, but the desire to have Grantha transcribed into Devan?gar? was probably a factor too.
