Hi Joseph,
     The following article by S.G. Kantawala discusses the rite of pratyavarohana:

Hope this helps you.  Best,

Hello Joseph,
     The Pali expression paccorohanii almost certainly corresponds to Sanskrit Pratyavaroha??, rather than Pa?carohani.  The verb pratyavarohati (Ardhamagadhi: paccoruhai) is commonly found in the Br?hma?a texts like the ?atapatha.  I am not so familiar with all the  ritual literature, but there may be a ritual in the Br?hma?as that is referred to by this name.  Best,

There are three sutras in the Anguttara Nikaya that mention a Paccorohanii festival celebrated by brahmins. The Chinese version of AN 10.167 gives a few more details than the Pali, but not much. Does anyone out there know of any discussion of this festival? Better yet, has anyone ever found a brahmanical source discussing this festival? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
