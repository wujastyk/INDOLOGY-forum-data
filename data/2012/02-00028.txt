Dear colleagues,
I read in BEFEO 1911, p. 267, that ??mare?vara would be a name of Avalokite?vara. This concerns a Buddhist inscription of Camp? which actually seems to read rather ?amare?vara. Either way, I cannot confirm the idea that this would be an alias of Avalokite?vara. Can anyone help me confirm or reject this identification? 
Thank you. Best wishesm
