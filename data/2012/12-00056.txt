I am very sorry to read the sad news. But he should have been around 75 now. He went early. For sometime he sent his papers regularly. About a few years I have not heard anything from the learned Professor.? Was he ill? I am not acquainted with any of his relation but can realize the feeling of his near ones. I convey general condolence. And a special for Professor Victor van Bijlert who did his doctorate under him and who belongs to this Forum.

dear Friends,

It is with great sadness and shock that I pass along the news that Prof Tilmann Vetter passed away this morning quite suddenly. The funeral will be private. If you would like to send messages to Mrs Vetter, I can collect them?and convey them to her?(please send them to me privately if they are intended for her, and not to the list).?

Jonathan Silk
