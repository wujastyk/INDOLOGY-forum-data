Mysticism
2 5 12
According
to V?caspati Mi?ra?s explanation occurring in his comments on the first verse
of the S??khyak?rik?s the term ?dhy?tmika means ?relating to self - mentally
or physically?. ?The same meaning of the
term will be found in the Nirukta. When the speaker of a hymn is in the first
person, it is called ?dhy?tmika. The term adhy?tmayoga is used
very generally in the G?t? for spiritual practice. The Kanna? usage might have
its influence.
Though Plotinus
had been preceded by the Upani?ads and Buddhism, it will be futile to find exact
parallels. Earlier Indian theologians were more concerned with salvation so
that the soteriological i.e salvation related aspects, with or without
unity with divinity, gained prominence in their deliberations.
However,
the type of erotic mysticism that appeared in, say, very late medieval Dutch
religious practice and thought will be found also in contemporary India. They go
under the term bhaktis?dhan?There were strong anti-erotic-mystic movements too
within India.? As late as the 20th century some British theologians decried the ?corruptions? in Indian religions
by which they meant erotic mysticism. 
The works on bhakti by Dr.
Chinmayee Chatterjee deal with some aspects of what one calls Vai??ava
mysticism.
I am sorry for the long lecture.
But the aim was clarification.

Re: [INDOLOGY] Mysticism
In Kannada, the commonly used word in ?dhy?tmikate (which of course is Sanskrit ?dhy?tmikat?), but the same word also seems to be used as a supposed equivalent for 'spirituality'. As Dominik already said, it seems we have another example of incommensurability here.
