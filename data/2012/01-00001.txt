Devanagari newsgroup?
I have a little problem with a ligature, if that's the proper term, while 
composing in Devanagari via xeLaTeX. I remember someone mentioning there was 
a newsgroup devoted exclusively to Devanagari composition questions, but I 
have not been successful in finding it. Can anyone direct me?
Gratefully,
Bob Hueckstedt
PS: If you're interested, the problem has to do with j~na. It comes out fine 
in regular text, but it does not come out fine in footnotes.
Here's a sample file:
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{fontspec}
\usepackage{xunicode}
\usepackage{xltxtra}
\setmainfont{IndUni-P}
\newcommand\dn{\catcode`\~=12
     \fontspec[Script=Devanagari,Mapping=velthuis-sanskrit]{Sanskrit2003}}
\begin{document}
{\dn j~nAna}\footnote{The meaning of this is {\dn j~nAna}.} {\dn vidyA}
\end{document}
