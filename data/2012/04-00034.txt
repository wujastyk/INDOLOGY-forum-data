Dear Indology List Members,

I am pleased to be able to forward this announcement from the University of Virginia, which has received a substantial gift in support of the study of yoga and other, similar systems of knowledge and practice.

Among its various activities, the Center will sponsor research both in the medical and natural sciences and in the humanities.

Sincerely,
John
