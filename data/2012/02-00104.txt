Prenatal suffering [Was: A Query re the development of garbha]
Dear Johanna,
While still residing in the womb (/garbhastha/) the embryo is said to be 
pressed by the /chorion/ like one squeezed down by mountains; soaked by 
the amniotic fluid like one fallen into the sea; ?cooked? by digestive 
fire like one thrown into a hot brass pot; and experiencing eight times 
as much suffering as one pierced by red-hot needles. The suffering 
inflicted by the dreadful contraption of the vagina (/yoniyantra/) at 
deliverance is, however, 10 million times as much as that experienced in 
the womb. The /dehin/ who has finally ?thickened? (/samm?rchita/!) and 
is ready to be born is thoroughly crushed like a cane by a grinder, his 
head pounded by a nasty hammer while he is helplessly blown out by the 
powerful winds of childbirth. Crushed by the /yoniyantra/, the newborn 
body is as sapless as a sugar cane driven through a grinder. Then the 
text goes on to expatiate on the impurity of the bodily frame by 
detailing its filthy components.
As a consequence of the agony of childbirth the newborn baby is seized 
by a violent fever which erases the memory of past lives and the 
embryo?s former resolve to attain liberation through /?ivaj??na./ It is 
indeed as a remedy for such forgetfulness that the present /??stra 
/(i.e. the /?ivadharmottara/) has been proclaimed by ?iva, in order to 
denounce the evils of /sa?s?ra/ and make for heaven or liberation.
All this surely stands in stark contrast to Western psychoanalytic views 
of a prenatal ?paradise lost?! What about East Asian views?
