Dear all,

I'm sorry for wasting your bandwidth and possibly brainwidth.  I've just
worked out that the running numbers in the General No. column are
abbreviated, and the head-number on each page gives the actual four-digit
MS number.  I think I knew this once, long ago.

Please ignore my query, and accept my apology.

Dominik
