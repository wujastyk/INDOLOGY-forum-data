Aryan and Aristos/Arete
Dear Indologists,
I have a quick question the answer to which I don't have time to track down
myself, but I imagine someone on this list knows far better than I do.
Are the Greek terms for virtue, excellence (arete and aristos) connected
etymologically with Aryan?
Thanks so much to anyone who can shed some light on this for me.
