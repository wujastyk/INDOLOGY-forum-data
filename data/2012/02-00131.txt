> Dear Sir,
> I also feel very sorry for the demise of Dr.Staal. But every body has to leave the earth at a particular time. As per Hindu philosophy, the soul leaves the body and search for another body for re-birth. Let us hope that Dr.Staal will have a re-birth in India as a Kerala Brahmin, who will perform an Athirathra himself.

(O.N.Damodaran is the son of O.M.C.NARAYANAN NAMBOODIRI PAD, the translator of the complete Rg-Veda into Malayalam: several exemplars still available for free at the mana)

and the "Frits Staal Corner" of the Library:

(O.N.Damodaran has also a video of the recent last visit of Staal at the mana)

Of course, since, as it is told, the birth-sufferings makes the embryo forget the knowledge of his past-lifes (that he fully has within the womb), this young Nambudiri brahmin will have to restart the Vedic learning...
