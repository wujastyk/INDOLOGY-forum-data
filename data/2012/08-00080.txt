Friedrich Weller Price
Belated Congratulations to Isabelle Rati? for being awarded the  
Friedrich Weller Price of the Saxon Academy of Sciences 2012 for her  
outstanding work:
*Le Soi et l?Autre. Identit?, diff?rence et alt?rit? dans la  
philosophie de la Pratyabhij??, Jerusalem Studies in Religion and  
Culture 13, Brill, Leiden, 2011.*
The decision of the jury was unanimous.
The statutes of the price are now being revised. I will send the new  
statues to this list as soon as they become official.
With best wishes,
Eli Franco
