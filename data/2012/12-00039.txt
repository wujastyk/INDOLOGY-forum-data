Orissa Historical Research Journal
Dear colleagues,
I had a vague memory of having seen a website with the complete OHRJ in digital (pdf) format, but I cannot find it through google.
Concretely, I'd like to have the article "Asanapat" by Aniruddha Das, OHRJ 13 (2), 1965, pp. 1-8 (with plate).
Many thanks for any help in this regard.
