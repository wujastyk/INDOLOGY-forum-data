Toponym help ?
Since Kadali vana (Plantain Forest) and Kadali nagaram (Plantain city) are
most frequently mentioned in the N?th Siddha legends as located near
Tryambaka k?etra (Nasik), we have to assume that the place-names mentioned
here are in the vicinity of N?sik (where God?vari originated) in the state
of Maharashtra (also see White 1998:113). There is a town named Ambad south
of Nasik, and a few villages named Kelewadi (Kele < *Kadali 'banana') but
not sure if any of them refer to the places you mentioned.
You are right, it can't be the Kadali near the Andhra coast, just north of
the God?var? delta, as it is actually spelled as Ka?ali with retroflex ? (Ka
?ali=ocean).
Another perspective is that if consider k???a-giri 'black hill' same
as Nallamala
Hills (nalla' black', mala 'hill'), in Andhra Pradesh, then the reference
may be about the region in and around Srisailam. There is, in fact, a  Kadali
Vanam at about 25 km distance from Srisailam. The caves here, also known as
Akkamahadevi caves, are a big tourist attraction. The only problem with
such association, however, is that the river near this region is not
Godavari, but Krishna.
For What it's Worth,
Suresh.
