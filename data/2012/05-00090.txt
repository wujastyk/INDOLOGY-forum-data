Johannes Bronkhorst Felicitation Volume
Dear Friends and Colleages,
On behalf of the editing committee, I am pleased to announce that the Felicitation Volume for Professor Johannes Bronkhorst has finally appeared in the series "World of South and Inner Asia" published by Peter Lang.
This (rather voluminous) publication contains contributions on many different topics by distinguished scholars in our field.
It can be ordered directly from Peter Lang in traditional or electronic book form (http://www.peterlang.com/index.cfm?event=cmp.ccc.seitenstruktur.detailseiten&seitentyp=produkt&pk=61802&cid=367&concordeid=430682). 
Hoping it will be of interest to many, 
Yours sincerely,
Dr Fran?ois Voegeli
