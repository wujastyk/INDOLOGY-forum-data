Certificate of Affiliation
Dear List,
My name is Patrick. I'm a first-year Phd candidate at The ANU, Australia.
My focus is sociolinguistics. I'm interested in identifying Sanskritic
nodes of power within a Sanskrit speaking community in southern Gujarat;
the resultant valency patterns of truth/knowledge; the functions of
Sanskrit during transactions of capital (economic-social-religious), and
Sanskrit's relationship to processes of legitimation of authority,
contestation of space and cultural reproduction. I'm also interested in the
broader processes/discourses of interdependency between this community and
the local region/state.
I have just returned from the Indian High Commission in Canberra. Mr Kumar
wants to give me a student research visa, however, he requires a
Certificate of Affiliation from a UGC recognised college/university.
I have had no luck obtaining such a certificate. All of my emails to
academics at Indian universities have remained unanswered.
 I hope that someone on this list may be able to assist me?
I look forward to hearing from you. I have attached my CV.
All the best,
Patrick McCartney
