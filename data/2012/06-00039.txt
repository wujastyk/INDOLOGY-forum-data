Sinhala ligatures
Dear List Members,
I have agreed to prepare the international transliteration and Polish
transcription
tables for the Sinhalese script - for a publication planned by the
Commission on Standardization of Geographical Names outside the
Republic of Poland.
Unfortunately, the Sinhalese fonts I have at my disposal (Potha,
Iskool Pota, Kandy & Kaputa Unicode) do not allow one to create
ligatures ( sucha sa: kva, k?a, ??a, ddha, dva, tva, nda, etc.). The
same goes for grafemes with adscript consonants (r-, -r, -y: ??a, rya,
dra, dya, kya, tya, vya).
The Web has a lot of examples of such ligatures, but always inserted
in the text as graphic files.
Does anyone, by any chance, know of a downloadable Sinhala font that
would show these elements? Or - of such ligatures emebedded in some
document - but not as graphics?
Thanking you in advance,
Artur Karp
