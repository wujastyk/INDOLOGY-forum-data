Chinese representation of Sanskrit names
Dear colleagues,
Can anyone help me obtain a pdf of this work?
Grunds?tzliches zur Wiedergabe fremder L?nder und Ortsnamen im Chinesischen by O. Franke
(see: http://www.sudoc.fr/103468544)
Tips for other studies relevant to personal names are welcome.
In particular, I want to known the pros and cons of the argument (which I'd like to make) that 
Zhan-da-bo ??? in the Xin Tang shu would be a representation of the name Candravarma(n) attested in a possibly 8th-century inscription from Western Borneo.
Thank you.
