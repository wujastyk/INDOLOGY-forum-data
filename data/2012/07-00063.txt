Subject: Chinese representation of Sanskrit names
Message-ID: <161227096897.23782.10863520947678190846.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>


Dear colleagues,

Can anyone help me obtain a pdf of this work?

Grunds?tzliches zur Wiedergabe fremder L?nder und Ortsnamen im Chinesischen by O. Franke
(see: http://www.sudoc.fr/103468544)

Tips for other studies relevant to personal names are welcome.

In particular, I want to known the pros and cons of the argument (which I'd like to make) that 













Zhan-da-bo ??? in the Xin Tang shu would be a representation of the name Candravarma(n) attested in a possibly 8th-century inscription from Western Borneo.

Thank you.
