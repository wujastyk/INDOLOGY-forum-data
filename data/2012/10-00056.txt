svara as breathing/respiration
In the description
of the generation of sound, P??in?ya?ik?? vss 6cd and 7ab state:
?The mind hits the bodily fire, that sends the (bodily)
wind (=breath), the breath roaming in the breast generates
a charming svara.? 
The place of the wind ie breast seems to indicate that
life-breath that is Pr??a is meant. Not
itself svara it is held responsible for its generation.

[INDOLOGY] svara as breathing/respiration
Respected Scholars,
?
I?am looking for the earliest textual?references?of?"svara" used in term of "breathing" apart from Yogic texts. 
I find close evidences i.e ?"praa.na is svara" in Upanisads.Still I look for it?in particular in?tantra literature.?
?
Thank you all in advance for your help and suggestions!
Regards,
