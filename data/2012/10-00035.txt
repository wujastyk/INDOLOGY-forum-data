Indian school children offered courses in Knowledge              Traditions and Practices of India
Dear SP,
why should you be disappointed?
Which books in English can you recommend for an initiation of all Indian 
children to ancient Tamil music (which is an important branch of ancient 
Indian music)?
I have recently acquired a book (??????? ???? [i??icai y??]) by ????????? 
???????? (m?rkare? p?s?i?) which appeared in 2006 (see attached file) in 
which she comments on the path-breaking 1947 book ???? ???? ??????? ?????????? 
???? [y?? n?l e??um icaittami? n?l] by ?????????? ?????? [vipul??anta cuv?mi],
and it seems to be interesting, but until an English version appears, 
what to do?
The books by Prof. P. Sambamurthy are not specific enough.
And the 1979 book by S. Ramanathan (/Music in the Cilappatikaaram/) was 
not written for the general public.
I don't suppose you would recommend the reading of books by Abraham 
Pandithar (who was a believer in Lemuria) ...
If the instances which are capable of action in Tamil Nadu had 
concentrated their energy in preparing English translations of important 
Tamil books rather than fighting for a long time against Unicode (this 
is fortunately now a thing of the past), there might be more useable 
documents in wide circulation.
