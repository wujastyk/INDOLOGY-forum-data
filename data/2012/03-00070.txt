Another point in favor of including the readings of printed editions is that they often contain conjectures and emendations that might be valuable for reconstituting the text.  It is an open secret that scribes are not, in fact, imperfect copy-machines, but often seek to improve real or perceived deficiencies in a text.  To privilege the reading of an editor writing by hand from a hundred years ago to one writing today with a computer is based on fallacious understanding of textual criticism.  Each reading must surely be evaluated on its own merits and based on all of the available evidence that backs it up.

There could be pragmatic and substantial reasons for using them. Pragmatically -- and this was my principal reason -- I thought it good for people who have been using these editions in the past to see how their readings compared with both the critically constituted text and the readings of various manuscript traditions. It was illuminating to see that most followed the Kull?ka manuscripts; actually one can make a stemma of these printed editions that tend to follow each other!!

There were some used by Jolly that I was unable to use, and thus I used the variants from these provided by Jolly. The same happened in my edition of the Vi??u Sm?ti -- the Adyar Library edition had used some manuscripts that I was unable to obtain.

He discovered that Ananadashrama Press eds. of the same title frequently represent different readings, that instead of resetting the text from a copy of an earlier ed. they published, they would sometimes start over from scratch.  Consequently he was trying to get copies of all the Press's editions for the Regenstein, not only all its titles.
