Manuscript copies of printed books
Another point in favor of including the readings of printed editions is that they often contain conjectures and emendations that might be valuable for reconstituting the text.  It is an open secret that scribes are not, in fact, imperfect copy-machines, but often seek to improve real or perceived deficiencies in a text.  To privilege the reading of an editor writing by hand from a hundred years ago to one writing today with a computer is based on fallacious understanding of textual criticism.  Each reading must surely be evaluated on its own merits and based on all of the available evidence that backs it up.
