Indology is not large enough to necessitate an active web forum, I don't think (in fact, I imagine the annoyance of logging in, scanning forums, posting between forums, etc. will decrease activity), so if the choice is "one or the other," I would much prefer an email-based system like we use now.
Best,

         At some point in the future, this INDOLOGY list will need an
         update or overhaul.  Looking around at the software that's
         available, it looks as if we would have the choice between
         continuing with an email-based discussion forum very much as we
         do now, or switching to a "bulletin board" style of system,
         which would be manipulated through a website.  It would be nice
         to have both in one package, but so far I haven't found that
         (except Google groups, which I'd prefer not to use for other
         reasons).
         I've put together a simple poll to ask your opinion.  Would you
         vote here please?

         If there's an option I haven't thought of, you can add it.
