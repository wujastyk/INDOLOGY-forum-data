Pu=?UTF-8?Q?=E1=B9=9Fam?= 332.5-6
I wanted to respond to this posting earlier, but got tied up with  
other things. I'm glad George stepped in.
The usage "ma?kala maka?ir" in pu?an????u 332 has a  
parallel in cilappatik?ram where m?tavi is referred to as a  
"ma?kala ma?antai" when she and k?vala? give away a great deal  
of gold on the occasion of celebrating the birth of ma?im?kalai. It  
is not clear what the author meant -- m?tavi was a participant in a  
charitable activity (which was also 'auspicious' considering the  
occasion of childbirth)? or, the cilappatik?ram supports the view  
that the attribute "ma?kala" has some connection with courtesan(s).
Other contexts/phrases to consider from early texts: v??  
ma?kalam, ku?ai ma?kalam, ?r ma?kalam, n?? ma?kalam,  
ma??u ma?kalam, and so on.
However, the tirukku?a? uses the term ma?kalam differently:  
"ma?kalam e?pa ma?ai-m??ci ..."
There seems to be a semantic shift in the usage of the term under  
consideration.
