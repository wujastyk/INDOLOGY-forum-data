Dear Colleague,

After convening two intensive courses in Indian codicology in the years

2010?2011, Centre for Eurasiatic and Afroasiatic Studies (CEAS), Bucharest,
organizes between September 27th and 1st October 2012 a course on Sanskrit
metrics, entitled ?Introduction to Sanskrit Prosody up to 12th Century CE
with
demonstration and practice?.

The course shall be taught by Dr. Shreenand Bapat, assistant curator at
Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Pune, grammarian (PhD in Tilak
Maharastra Vidyapeeth, 2010) and archaeologist (MA in Deccan College), a
fluent
speaker of Sanskrit, language in which himself is capable of composing
verses in
various metres.

On behalf of the Centre for Eurasiatic and Afroasiatic Studies (CEAS) I
invite
you to the course which is offered free of charge. A part of the didactic
materials shall be provided one month in advance via email, upon firm
admission.

A basic knowledge of Sanskrit is required for successfully attending the
said
course.

For the course description and general information, please refer to our
site at the link below:

I would be very grateful if you could let your students learn about the
prosody
course organized by CEAS.

Looking forward to hearing from you,
Julieta Rotaru
