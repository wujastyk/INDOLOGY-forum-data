Hello Stephen,

     The Ny?yako?a of Bh?m?c?rya Jhalkikar (2nd edition, BORI, Pune, 1928, p. 399) quotes a traditional verse giving six meaning of negation:

s?d??yam tad-abh?va? ca tad-anyatva? tad-alpat? / apr??astya? virodha? ca na?-arth?? ?a? prak?rtit?? //

No source is given for this verse, but I have heard it being cited when I was reading ??stric Sanskrit works in Pune.  Best,

Madhav

Dear Colleagues,

The general term in tradtional Sanskrit grammars for negation is, of course,
prati?edha.  Due to my lack of in-depth familiarity with the traditional
grammars, I wonder if somebody might be able to help me.  I am trying to
find Sanskrit terms, if any, for the different sub-classes of negation, in
particular for the various types of "a-" (for the negative of privation
etc). All I can find are examples of about 6 sub-categories, but no
terminology. I am trying to retrovert with a modicom of accuracy some terms
from Tibetan. Any suggestions most welcome.

Best wishes,

Stephen Hodge
