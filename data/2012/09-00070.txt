BORI contact
Dear List,
Has anyone had success contacting BORI via email recently? Their email
address <bori1 at vsnl.net> is no longer active. I get this message: Recipient
address rejected: USER IS SUSPENDED.
I know Arun Barve is the new Secretary, does he have a personal email
address?
Be grateful for any suggestions,
Joydeep
