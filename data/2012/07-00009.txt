Anup Sanskrit Library catalogue scan?
Dear Colleagues,
Is anyone aware of a digital copy of the *Catalogue of the Anup Sanskrit
Library* by C Kunhan Raja and
K. Madhava Krishna Sarma (Bikaner: The Authority, [Govt. Press],
1944-1948)?  It was reprinted in 1993.
I've looked in the Digital Library of India, Archive.org, bookfi dot org,
and one or two other places.  On Google books I find fasc. II of 1946 and
the 1993 reprint, but neither is downloadable.
Best,
Dominik Wujastyk
