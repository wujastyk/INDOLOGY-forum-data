Utilising printed edition for a critical edition
While I do not want to pick a fight when you have also made a good point, I must note that you have unfairly cut what I have said. I said: "While it may be necessary to collate printed editions, it may not be required to report their readings in a critical edition, if the editor is confident that the only significant readings are conjectures. The critical editor may eliminate previous editions: if the editor is reasonabally confident that a given editor used manuscripts represented in his or her edition, it should be acceptable to report only the readings in the previous editions that appear to be conjectural. Printed editions whose only contribution is the odd contribution [sic - here should have said emendation or conjecture] clutter a critical edition's apparatus and make it more difficult for the reader to evaluate the editor's choices."
I am well aware that not all editors are careful to identify their emendations and conjectures. Further, they do not all carefully identify the manuscripts they used, if indeed they identify them at all. The Pandit edition of vidhiviveka.h and nyaayaka.nikaa, for example, identifies the manuscripts of nyaayaka.nikaa simply as 1 pu. paa. and 2 pu. paa. The same edition fails to mention that it reconstructs the beginning of vidhiviveka.h and one or two other passages from nyaayaka.nikaa.
