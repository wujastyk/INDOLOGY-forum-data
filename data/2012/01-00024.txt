In addition ... the ?cole Fran?aise d'Extr?me-Orient at Pondicherry  
in India has an excellent collection of manuscripts.

Dominic Goodall was its Director for more than a decade, I think.  
John-Luc Chevillard is a permanent scholar there, but occasional  
visitor I suppose. If I'm wrong about this information, please pardon  
me and correct me.

The point is ... that both Dominic Goodall and John-Luc Chevillard  
can update this forum about their wonderful, excellent, library in  
Pondicherry. I was there during the Summer months last year. I'm  
planning to return to that place as soon as I can this year! :-)

Thanks and regards,
Rajam
