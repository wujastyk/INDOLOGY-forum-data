hinduism film recommendations
Dear colleagues,
A few weeks ago, I asked for film recommendations for an introduction to Hinduism course and received a flood of wonderful suggestions. As promised, I am sending you here the results of that discussion thread. I am sure many of you will find the list of recommendations useful for your own classrooms as well.
I mentioned in the email that a similar discussion took place on H-Buddhism a few months back and a number of you asked if you could see the list of sources that circulated as a result of that discussion. I have asked Sarah Jacoby, the scholar who offered to compile the suggestions into one file, if I could share her file with this list and she happily agreed. I am therefore attaching here for you two  documents - recommendations for Buddhism and recommendations for Hinduism. If I can figure out, I will also post these on the Indology FAQ.
Best wishes,
vanessa
