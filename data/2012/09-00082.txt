Amarakosa commentary
Dear all,
I am overwhelmed by the prompt replies of Benjamin Flemming, Christopher
Vielle, Dominik Wujastyk, Victor Davella, Peter Wyzlic and Reinhold
Gruenendahl.. I have already received scans of parts 1, 3, and 4 (DW)
and will hopefully get part 2 in the near future. Hence the problem of
my Indian colleague seems to be perfectly solved.
Thanks to everybody!
