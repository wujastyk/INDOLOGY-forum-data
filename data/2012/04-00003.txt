Thank you very much!


I am translating a note in Tamil by Dr. Dayalan of Archaeological Survey of India. "There is a temple carved out of a monolith in the Gwalior fort. This temple is called Caturbhuja temple. In the four agni ku??as in this temple two contain the sculptures of Pa?c?gni Tapa P?rvat?. These four ku??as along with the sun are together called pa?c?gni. In the North Indian region in the temple art of the Mauryas and Pratih?ras, this type of P?rvat? figure will be shown in sitting or standing postures. Near the Pa?c?gni Tapa P?rvat? figure in Gwalior, a lion and a blackbuck are shown as her vehicles. It is noteworthy that this tradition is  shown in many places in Tamil Nadu especially in the Durg? sculptures in Mahabalipuram. Shown with the four hands with varada mudr?, rudr?k?a string, kama??alu, and darbha grass, this figure is related to the agni ku??a." (Aru?miku Periyan?yaki Amma? E??a Vayaln?cciyamma? Tirukk?yil Tirukku?a Na???r???u Vi?? Ci?appu Malar, 2009, p.97)


It is nice to see the lion and blackbuck clearly in the sculpture. I can see the kama??alu clearly too. Is her upper left hand holding the string of rudr?k?a beads? Is her lower right hand holding the darbha grass? Is her broken upper right hand supposed to show the varada mudr??


This sculpture clearly parallels the Tamil Nadu figures showing lion and blackbuck and the date is shown on the picture to be 10th century AD. Since is Suhaniya in Morena District is some distance from Gwalior, I am assuming this sculpture is one that is similar to the Gwalior fort sculpture but not identical. This is indeed very valuable. I am still interested in the Gwalior fort sculpture and its date.


Thanks in advance.
