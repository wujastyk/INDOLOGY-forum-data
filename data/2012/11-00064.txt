role of Nirukta in Vedic mythology
Dear Colleague,
Nirukta 7.5-7 give a
general assessment, 8-10 are more particular, 11-13 go even farther and pedantically. After
that each god is individually treated.
There is a note on anthropomorphism according to the Nirukta in Indian Etymologists and their Etymologies,
Rabindra Bharati University, Kolkata 2002:31. Some comments will be found in Maxmueller's History of Sanskrit literature, 1858(?). There are other stray comments elsewhere but no comprehensive treatment.
Best
