Dear colleagues and friends,

although I would not recommend it for Christmas, I realise I did not announce the release of this book of mine:

Duty, language and exegesis in Pr?bh?kara M?m??s?: Including an edition and translation of R?m?nuj?c?rya's Tantrarahasya, ??straprameyapariccheda.
The book is included in the Jerusalem Studies on the History of Religion Series and has been published by Brill, Leiden in November 2012.
 
Apart from the Indologica.de (to whose author goes my gratitude for his great work) and the Brill webpages, you might find further information here:

Further information, including my attempts to overcome the high price of the book:

Any suggestions and criticisms are warmly welcome,
