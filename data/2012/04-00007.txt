Gwalior Fort Pancagni Tapa Parvati
You are right, this is not the image from the Caturbhuja Temple of the
Gwalior Fort.
This one is displayed in the Museum of the Gwalior Fort.
The rudr?k?a in upper left hand is clear to me.
The vararadamudr? would be shown in lower right hand.
As for the darbha, maybe it was in the upper right hand.
For other P?rvat?s with lion and stag/dear/buck
outside Tamil Nadu, see, as indicated to me by Charlotte
Schmid, fig. 202, 245, and 247 in "Discourse on ?iva" ed.
W. Meister.
On fig. 245, lower right hand varadamudr? is clear and
rudr?k?a is in upper right hand.
I would not correlate these images to the Tamil "Durg?s."
Lion and stag are vehicles of the Tamil Ko??avai.
In the case of our ascetic P?rvat?s, I see them as the usual elements
of a peaceful ??rama, as in the images of the preaching Buddha or of
Dak?i??m?rti.
With best wishes.
