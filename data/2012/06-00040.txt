Dear Colleagues,

my sincere thanks to?Tatiana Oranskaia, Rohana Seneviratne, James Gair
and Simon Wiles - who used some of their valuable time to answer my
request for assistance re Sinhala fonts and ligatures.

I am now well equipped to tackle my task head on.

The bhashittha complex font sent by Simon Wiles seems to solve all my
problems with the Sinhala script (simple and conjunct letters), and
all what is needed for the transliteration is supplied by the gandhari
unicode font.

Thanks once more,

Artur Karp
