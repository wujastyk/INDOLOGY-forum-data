Santipur OT
Dear All,
The problem is already solved. A friendly and kind advice (or 'hitopade?a')
from Dr. Viacheslav Zaytsev from the Institute of Oriental Manuscripts of
the Russian Academy of Sciences, St. Petersburg.
To whom my special thanks.
In fact a simple operation. To produce, say, *ndrya*: from the symbols
table of, say, Arial Unicode, select *?*, add *virama*, add *?*, add *virama
*, add *?*, add *virama*, add ?:
[na + virama - n + da - nda + virama - nd + ra - ndra + virama - ndr + ya =
ndrya]
? - ?? - ??? - ???? - ????? - ?????? - ???????
??? ????? ???
The same rule goes for santipur OT, bengali fonts, like shonar.ttf or
vrinda.ttf, etc.
Best,
