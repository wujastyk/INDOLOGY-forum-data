       To: Soni at staff.uni-marburg.de

Dear Dr Soni,

This is the final call for proposals for papers, panels and
roundtables for ICAS 8 in Macau, 24-27 June 2013.

Deadline Proposals: 15 July 2012

The International Convention of Asia Scholars (ICAS) is the premier
international gathering in the field of Asian Studies. It attracts
participants from over 60 countries to engage in global dialogues on
Asia that transcend boundaries between academic disciplines and
geographic areas. Since 1998, ICAS has brought more than 15,000
academics together at seven conventions.

ICAS 8 will be hosted by the University of Macau (UM) and will be
held in the Venetian Macao-Resort-Hotel. Some 1,500 to 2,500 Asia
specialists are expected to attend. This city is located in the heart
of East Asia and successfully merges its long history of culture and
tradition with diversity and cosmopolitanism.

Submission of Individual Papers, Organized Panels (organized by a
group of varying (national) backgrounds), Institutional Panels
(constituted and sponsored by an institution, association, network or
company), and Roundtable proposals.

Please note that all abstracts and presentations should be in
English. Submission of abstracts for panels, roundtables and papers
can be made using ICAS 8 registration forms, available from
