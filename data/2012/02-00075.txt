Dear Artur Karp, dear list-members,

I think that the more commonly used Sanskrit name for the ka.thina is probably the ghana, e.g. in this quotation in the Abhidharmako"sabhaa.sya:

kalala.m prathama.m bhavati kalalaaj jaayate ?rbuda.h
arbudaaj jaayate pe"sii pe"siito jaayate ghana.h
ghanaat pra"saakhaa jaayante ke"saromanakhaadaya.h

You could look at Carl Suneson, 1991, "Remarks on some interrelated terms in the ancient Indian embryology", WZKS XXXV (1991), pp. 109--122.
For some further "Saiva passages, you could look at footnote 348 on pp. 244--246 of my translation of the Paraakhyatantra.
