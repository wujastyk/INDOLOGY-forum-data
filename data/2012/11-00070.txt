Scan of Katre's Intro to Indian Textual Criticism?
Dear Will,
thanks a lot for the pointer.
I have been able to install the software
and to download my first book,
which resulted in a 100 Mb pdf file
(for 527 pages)
[An Indian Ephemeris, Vol. I, Part I]
I had to try, however, seven times
before succeeding...
[After the second try, I switched to "safe mode"]
The morning hours (here in Pondicherry)
seemed more favorable than the evening hours.
:-)
Thanks again
Best wishes
