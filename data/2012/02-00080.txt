Subject: FW: [INDOLOGY] A Query re the development of garbha

Please, Prof, Magnone,

 

Would you also describe what these tortures entail: 

?(a pledge, alas! soon to be forgotten because of the hellish tortures inflicted by the yoniyantra?)?. So what are these?  I want to compare them to East Asian views on childbirth and the female.

 

Thanks,

Joanna Kirkpatrick

Dear Arthur and List,

?ivadharmottara Pur??a 8, 26-52 describes the different stages of the conception, formation and development of the embryo, up to the point when the j?va acquires consciousness and remembrance of his past sorrowful incarnations, pledging to put an end to such course in his life soon to begin through the study of ?ivaj??na! (a pledge, alas! soon to be forgotten because of the hellish tortures inflicted by the yoniyantra and of the agony of childbirth).

The relevant passage (28-29) apparently contemplates three main phases, marked by three different terms (which do not include ka?hina): kalala, arbuda (budbuda in another MS) and pe??.
 
tac chukra? raktasa?yuktam ek?h?t kalala? bhavet
    pa?car?tre?a kalalam arbud?k?rat?? vrajet
arbuda? saptar?tre?a m??sape?? bhavet tata?
    dvisapt?h?d bhavet pe?? raktam??sacit? d??h?

Dear List,
 
According to the Garbhopani?at  human embryos "solidify" one month
after conception, they become ka?hina. Turner (CDIAL 2650) informs the
word is used in the Su?rutasa?hit? and suggests it could be a
Dravidian borrowing.
 
[an embryo becomes] m?s?bhyantare ka?hina?: "in a month, it hardens".
A quick check of the Su?rutasa?hit? text doesn't show any phrase
combining the two: garbha and ka?hina.
 
Are there any other words used to describe this stage of the embryo's
'hardening' or 'solidification'? Does also the Hiranyagarbha undergo
this stage?
 
 
Thanks in advance, and greetings from snowy Warsaw,
