Fwd: [INDOLOGY] Edward Conze's Memoirs
I have kept the following email communication by Paul Williams, Centre  
for Buddhist Studies, University of Bristol, on the 20th of Oct. 1995.
With best regards, AP
The bulk of Edward Conze's books and papers are held in the University  
of Bristol Library. However, when they were bought from Mrs. Conze  
soon after her husband's death, she did not let the library have the  
manuscript of Vol. 3 of the Memoirs, saying that EC did not wish it to  
be published until all those mentioned in the book were dead. Around  
1992 Mrs Conze told that she had destroyed the manuscript, thinking  
that its publication would not be good for the reputation of EC. But  
there may be another copy. Shenpen Hookham (the author of "The Buddha  
Within") may have access to some of Conze's papers not in Bristol --  
perhaps she knows where it is.
