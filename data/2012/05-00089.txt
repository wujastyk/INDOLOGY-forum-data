Subject: Lost later Chalukya sculpture of Dattatreya
Message-ID: <161227096342.23782.11107031922275664502.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear Colleagues,
for the front-cover of a book dealing with a (hitherto unpublished) Medieval Puranic text consisting in a dialogue between sage Dattatreya and king Janaka, in course of issuing in the Publications de l'Institut Orientaliste de Louvain series (http://www.peeters-leuven.be/boekoverz.asp?nr=9120), I would like to reproduce the image of the handsome piece of Later Chalukya sculpture that is
the Dattatreya (in yoga posture) said from Badami, 
as reproduced in Gopinatha Rao 1914, Pl. LXXIII (facing p. 254):

(vol. 2 available at: http://www.archive.org/details/cu31924071128841)
However, my estimate colleagues specialists in the field (Claudine Bautze-Picron, Carol Radcliffe Bolon, Gerard Foekema, J?rgen Neuss, Emmanuel Francis) who kindly tried to help me, did not success in tracing this sculpture, which appears to be neither in a temple, somewhere in situ, nor in any museum of India (AIIS, Huntington and IFP photography-archives have also been checked).
I would therefore very much appreciate if somebody happens to know more about this lost sculpture, and if a picture of it could be got and used for a book-cover. Of course, the author of the picture will be mentioned and will receive an exemplar of the book when issued.
With best wishes,
Christophe Vielle
