Dear Colleagues,
        In the the alchemical text, the Ras?r?ava, there are the following lines, mentioning several toponyns. I presume the author is alluding to real places, so if anybody can help with identifying the locations etc of the places mentioned, I would find it very helpful for a long-standing puzzle arising from other research.

asti martye mah?pu?y? pavitr? dak?i??-pathe |
nad? god?var? n?ma prasiddh? j?hnav? yath? || Ras 12.236 ||
dak?i?e ca ta?e tasy?? kadal?-nagara? param |
tasya dak?i?ata? ?aila? sarva-loke?u vi?ruta? || Ras 12.237 ||
n?mn? k???a-giri? ceti d??yate sarva-ma?gale |
suprasiddh?mbik? n?ma gr?mas tasy?sti sa?nidhau || Ras 12.238 ||

These are the places I need suggestions / help with:

kadal?-nagara? (of course, not the Kadali near the Andhra coast, just north of the God?var? delta)
k???a-giri?
ambik?

Best wishes,
Stephen Hodge
