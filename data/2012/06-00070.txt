Somehow this reminds me of the old joke about the Japanese development 
team's visit with the chief minister of Bihar:
Japanese: "given the rich resources of your state, give us three years and 
we'll turn Bihar into a second Japan."
CM: "that's nothing. Give me three months and I will turn Japan into a 
second Bihar!"
