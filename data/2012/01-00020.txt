  Dear Colleagues and friends,

Does anyone have access to a PDF copy of these articles? Our library
apparently doesn't have online access to these particular articles and
before trying to find a printed copy in the library or through the
inter-loan I would like to ask you if you have them at hand. Any efforts
are highly appreciated.
