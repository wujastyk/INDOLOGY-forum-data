R. S. Bhattacharya on commentarial writing
Pandit R.S.Bhattacharya died soon after. I did not find anyone taking interest. But more intensive search might give result.

[INDOLOGY] R. S. Bhattacharya on commentarial writing
Dear List members,
At several points in his brief and interesting article "Use of Manuscripts in Textual Criticism by our Commentators" (in V.V. Dwivedi and Janardan Pandey, ed. Samp?dana ke Siddh?nta aur Up?d?na, Sarnath: CIHTS, 1990), Ram Shankar Bhattacharya refers to his own forthcoming book-length study on the same subject. ?Do any of you know if this project was ever completed, and, if so, its publication details?
Thanks in advance,
Whitney
