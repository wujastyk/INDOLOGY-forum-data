sad new: Frits Staal
Dear Colleagues,
This is very sad news especially for us here at Berkeley where Frits spend so many years and where he was the founder of our Department of South and Southeast Asian Studies. He contributed enormously to Indological scholarship and was a friend and mentor to many.
