Improved DEDR Search
Dear all,
The Dravidian Etymological Dictionary (1961; revised in 1984) is a landmark
contribution of Burrow and Emeneau to the study of Dravidian

My friend Periannan Chandrasekaran and I have plans to work on providing

I appreciate any feedback from the scholarly community.
Regards,
Suresh.
