Sanskrit wiki - participation of scholars - an appeal
Dear colleagues,
Further to Prof. Varakhedi's post, may I clarify that he is promoting the
development of a Sanskrit-language section of the world-famous Wikipedia.
This is, in my view, a very good idea, and much preferable to creating a
separate wiki for Sanskrit contributions, that would inevitably become
ghettoized.  It will enable Sanskrit language contributors to make use of
the substantial writing aids and editorial support and control systems that
already exist within the main Wikipedia.  It will also give visibility to
Sanskrit as a member of the world family of languages that are important
enough to have representation in Wikipedia.
The Sanskrit Wikipedia pages are here:
