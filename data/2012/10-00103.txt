NS? (Re: [INDOLOGY] What about thirty-seven?
Dear Jean-Luc,
My apologies for answering quite (quite) late to your question. I  
wonder whether it is still a topical subject for you?
At least, I can give an element of answer : according to the  
Abhinavabhaaratii, Abhinavagupta's commentary on the Naa.tya"saastra   
?  see, especially,  the mangala of the commentary on the first  
chapter ?the number 36 is justified by, and correlated with, the  
number of the tattvas in the nondualistic "saivism of Kashmir  (where  
there are 36 tattvas, the system adding a superstructure of 11  
tattvas to the 25 tattvas of the Saa.mkhya).
Nevertheless, some editions of the texts present a 37th chapter, also  
commented by Abhinavagupta!
On those questions, allow me to refer to my work:  Po?tique du  
th??tre indien. Lectures du Naa.tya"saastra. Paris, ?cole Fran?aise  
d?Extr?me-Orient (? Publications de l?EFEO ?, 169), 1992, p.  27, and  
notes 39 and 40.
