Subject: Shantipur OT font
Message-ID: <161227096517.23782.10751181471859621609.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

If anyone has this font, would they be so kind as to send me a copy?  The
email address given at http://www.scsmath.narod.ru/6ot/ot.htm
doesn't work.

I'm after Shantipur OT, not Shantipur 99.

Many thanks,
Dominik Wujastyk
