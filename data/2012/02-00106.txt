Wonderful article.

A send-up of something reported in the Times of India in 2007:

It is sad to hear that the great discoverer, Smirrzkoff, was sent to 
Siberia because he "...was suddenly found to have stolen over 500,000 
paper clips from work over the course of his tenure at Odessa University."

Even better than the article are some of the comments...
