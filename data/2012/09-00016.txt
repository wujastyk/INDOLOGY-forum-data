The mere thought of benefitting [others] is better than worshipping a Buddha.

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Literary Histories of Jainism

Dear Indology list-members,
I am trying to compile a complete as possible list of literary histories of Jainism. With "literary histories" I do NOT mean studies or translations of specific works or studies of Jain doctrine, but only broader surveys that attempt to provide a historical outline of authors and works over a longer span of time. I also include histories of literature in specific languages, such as Prakrit, provided that these involve a substantial amount of Jain texts. However, I do not include library and manuscript catalogs or reports.

Below is a list of the Jain literary histories that I have already identified. I would like your feedback on whether there are any histories that I have overlooked.

List of Jain literary histories (in chronological order):

U.D. Barodia, 1909, History and Literature of Jainism.

Moritz Winternitz, 1920, Geschichte der indischen litteratur (A History of Indian Literature), vol. II.

Helmuth von Glasenapp, 1922, Die Literaturen Indiens von ihren Anf?ngen bis zur Gegenwart (The Literatures of India from their beginnings until the present).

Johannes Hertel, 1922, On the Literature of the Shvetambaras of Gujarat.

Hiralal Rasikdas Kapadia, 1941, A History of the Canonical Literature of the Jainas.

Appaswami Chakravarti, 1941, Jaina Literature in Tamil. Revised edition 1974.

Hariva??a Kochar, 1956, Apabhra??a-S?hitya (Apabhra??a Literature).

Jagdish Chandra Jain, 1961, Pr?k?t s?hitya k? itih?s (History of Prakrit Literature).

Ramsingh Tomar, 1964, Pr?k?t aur apabhra?? s?hitya, tath? hi?d? s?hitya par prabh?v (Prakrit and Apabhramsa Literature, and their Impact on Hindi Literature).

A.N. Upadhye, 1975, Pr?k?t Languages and Literature.

Jagdish Chandra Jain, 2004, History and Development of Prakrit Literature.

Dalsukh Malvania and Jayendra Soni, 2007, Jain Philosophy (Part I). Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, vol. 10.

Though not literary histories per se, I am also aware of Bhogilal J. Sandesara, 1953, Literary Circle of Mah?m?tya Vastup?la and its Contribution to Sanskrit Literature, and P.K. Gode, Studies in Indian Literary History. Vol. 1.

With best regards,
Tim
