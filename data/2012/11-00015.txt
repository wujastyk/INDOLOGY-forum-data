Dear colleagues,

Are you likely to be travelling indologically in Orissa in the near or
middle future?

I ask because I have information about two palm-leaf manuscripts of the *
Carakasa?hit?* that I would like to study.  My attempts to get access to
these, through third parties, have so far drawn a blank.

The information about these MSS comes from the online NAMAMI database,
which records the results of their field surveys done during the last five
years or so:

   1. in the collection of Dushmanta Mohanty (600 folios), Macchalo
   Ghasipura, Keonjhar, Orissa 758043. Tel. 261238.  (Keonjhar =
Kendujhar<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendujhar#External_links>
   )
   2. in the collection of Harihar Hota (102 folios), Tilotamadelpur,
   Sasan, Dharamkote, Ganjam, Orissa 761107. (Dharamkote presumably =
   Dharakote <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharakote>)

If anyone might be able to help with actually visiting these remote places,
I'd be very glad to discuss matters.  I have some more information about
these MSS and possible local contacts.

Best,
Dominik Wujastyk
