Bibliographical sources for Buddhist studies (PDF version)
dear Colleagues,
The author, Yasuhiro Sueki, has just informed me of the pdf publication of
his extremely useful bibliography (or meta-bibliography) of Bibliographical
sources for Buddhist studies. In fact, it is now even much more useful than
the printed edition, in particular thanks to the addition of hyperlinks,
both internal cross references and external links to websites.
The resource is now available at the Library
HP<http://www.icabs.ac.jp/english/library_e/bibliography_e.htm>
.
Enjoy!  Jonathan Silk
