Vishnu on the banks of the Volga river
Are you thinking of the Guldestrup Cauldron? I don't have the reference here, but some people have tried to attribute this to Thracian or Celtic origin (for the time being see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gundestrup_cauldron#Origins).
I want to take this opportunity to thank Viktoria Lyssenko for the image, which does indeed look like it may be quite old (how old, I wouldn't be qualified to tell). It's also interesting how this story, with or without embellishments such as "contracted poloniumitis of the nose"), is being adopted by Russian "Aryanists". (If I am right, the Russian version suggests that the embezzlement involved paper clippings, rather than paper clips.)
Cheers,
Hans
