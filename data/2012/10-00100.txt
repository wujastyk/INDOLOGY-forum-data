On the Date of Classical Tamil Poems
Dear Palaniappan,
I think you idea is a fascinating one, but I'd like to see clearer evidence linking the name P??a? to the B??a dynasty.  Here are two more poems:
Akan????u 113:
He has gone even beyond the good land of P??a?
who never shows his back in battle,
whose food is as plentiful as the food at a festival,
whose long spear has a black, dense ferrule and an oiled shaft,
and who, even though it was far away, looked for the right time,	15
went, took and drove the cattle and the hump-backed bulls
from the well-stocked fort where his enemies guarded them.
...?????????????? ??????
???????? ??????? ???????? ??????????
????????? ????? ??????? ???????
???????? ???????? ??????? ????????	15
??????????? ???? ????????? ??????
?????? ????? ????????? ??????...
This would seem to indicate that P??a? was a small king in a forest area, probably in the north of TN.  It seems unlikely that someone in the B?na dynasty would be referred to in these terms.  The P?lai poems often describe the hero's journey to the north (to or beyond the Ve?ka?am hills, to where even the language has changed), and these areas (modern Rayalaseema) are said to have been inhabited by fierce, marginal chiefs who would have no compunction killing the poor hero who wants to travel there.
Here is another one (Akam 226):
The gossip you created has grown, and today
it is louder than the clamor when Ka??i whose army kills in battle
joined with strong and brave P??a? to attack Titta? Ve?iya?
whose garland is full, and they heard the sweet sound	15
of the clear ki?ai drum as he held court in U?aiy?r
and, instead of fighting, they fled in terror.
????????? ???????? ??????? ????????? 
??????? ??????? ?????? ??????? 
??????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????,	15
????? ?????? ????? 
??????? ???? ??????????? ??????.
The ki?ai drum would be beaten at executions as well at other occasions (Pu?am 78).  While this could be describing a great king in the B??a dynasty, it seems to me it is of a piece with Akam 113 above and that P??a? is a minor king.  I'd love to see a bit of more conclusive evidence, as P??a? would here seem to be a native Tamil minor king.
The Ku?untokai poem is something of a puzzle.  P??ar here cannot refer to the king, as it is plural while kings are referred to the singular (as vicciyar perumaka?).  I cannot think of any place where the name of a king in the plural is used to refer to his subjects -- C?rar would refer to the Chera monarchs, not the people.  To add to your note, UVS says puli n?kku is a lion's gaze (si?h?valokanam -- puli can sometimes mean lion as well as tiger) and that the lion gazes in two directions at once, like the bards, who are non-fighters standing between the armies and looking at them both. The si?h?valokany?ya, according to Apte, is "The maxim of the lion's backward glance.  It is used when one casts a retrospective glance at what he has left behind while at the same time he is proceeding, just as the lion, while going onward in search of prey, now and then bends his neck backwards to see if anything is within his reach."  If this is the case, then the point of comparison is not the fierceness of the P??ars but the way they look forward to one army and back at the other.  The Kalittokai verse could also refer to how the warriors look before them and behind, though I can't find any commentary that says that.
I would add that I think the date of the older Sangam anthologies is quite firmly established as the first two  centuries AD.  The evidence, in my view, is overwhelming.  George Hart
