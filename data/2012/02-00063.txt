Hindu idea of "hidden" verses in heaven
Not just Hindu at all, nor just Tantric.
I discuss the range of these narratives at some length in chapter three of my forthcoming book, _Making Sense of Tantric Buddhism: History, Semiology and Transgression in the Indian Traditions_ (Columbia Univ. Press, due out autumn 2012).
An outstanding treatment of the subtending issues regarding intellectual/cultural organization that are implicit in such concepts may be found in: S. Pollock, "The Theory of Practice and the Practice of Theory in Indian Intellectual History," JAOS, vol. 105, no. 3, pp. 499-519.
