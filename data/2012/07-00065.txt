Dear friends,

I have on my hard drive a .pdf scan of H. C. Bhayani's article "The
Apabhra??a passages from Abhinavagupta's Tantras?ra and
Par?tri??ika-v?tti", which runs pp. 1-18 of an issue of the journal Vidy?,
for which I lack a volume number or a year.  Could any of you provide me
with the additional bibliographic detail?

Thanks in advance,

Whitney
