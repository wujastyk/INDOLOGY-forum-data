H. C. Bhayani on Abhinavagupta's              Apabhra=?UTF-8?Q?=E1=B9=83=C5=9Ba?=
Dear friends,
I have on my hard drive a .pdf scan of H. C. Bhayani's article "The
Apabhra??a passages from Abhinavagupta's Tantras?ra and
Par?tri??ika-v?tti", which runs pp. 1-18 of an issue of the journal Vidy?,
for which I lack a volume number or a year.  Could any of you provide me
with the additional bibliographic detail?
Thanks in advance,
Whitney
