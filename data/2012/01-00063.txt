Vikram calendar conversion
Dear all,
I was wondering if anyone could suggest a reliable resource for converting
dates in Vikrama Samvat to the Gregorian calendar? Any format-- printed
materials, web-based programs, etc-- would be welcome.  I am sure this
query has been raised multiple times in the past, so apologies if this
question is being repeated; thank you in advance for any suggestions you
may be able to give.
Best,
