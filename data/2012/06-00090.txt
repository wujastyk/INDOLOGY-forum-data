Deat Palaniappan,
Yes, the idea of a P???iya connection of ?r? M?ra has been proposed by J. Filliozat. See his article in BEFEO 55 (1969).

I believe there have been counterarguments but I don't now remember what they were and who has adduced them.
I don't know if the specific theme of P???iya connections with Southeast Asia has been explored exhaustively and in detail in recent decades, but occasional observations, e.g. inspired by the occurrence of a king called P?duka ?r? Mah?r?ja R?j?dhir?ja Parame?vara ?r? V?r?ka??agop?la ?r? Sundarap???yadev?dhi?vara Vikramottu?gadeva, in an East Javanese inscription of 1323 CE, are found in the works of various scholars.
Best wishes,

Sorry, there was a typo in my earlier post. ?r? M?ra ?r?vallabha? should actually be ?r? M??a ?r?vallabha?.

On page 83 of the article, the name of the king is ?r? M?ra. Has not somebody already noted the connection between this name and the name M??a? of Tamil P???iya dynasty? (I am unable to recall the reference.) A P???iya king Mu?a-t-Tiru M??a? has authored two Classical Tamil poems. The Sanskrit form of Tiru M??a? will be ?r? M?ra. The name of a a later P???iya king was ?r? M?ra ?r?vallabha?. 
According to R. C.
Majumdar (Study of Sanskrit in South-East Asia, p. 25), a Sanskrit inscription
was discovered in a place called Vat Luong Kau dated to be of the second half
of 5th century AD. "It begins with an invocation to Brahm?, Vi??u and ?iva
and then refers to the great king (mahar?j?dhir?ja) ?rI Dev?n?ka and compares
him with Yudhi??hira, Indra, DhanaJjaya, Indradyumna, ?ibi, Mah?puru?a,
Kanakap???ya(?), the great Ocean and Meru."
Has the possible P???iya connection to Southeast Asia been explored by scholars after K. K. Sarkar?
Thanks
