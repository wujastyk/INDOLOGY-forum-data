FW: Query from a colleague not on this list
Thanks, Bill Mak. 
I just today heard from the inquirer that somewhere among the many wonderful suggestions sent on his behalf, he has found what he needed.
Thanks to the many other listfolks? generosity with references.

Re: [INDOLOGY] FW: Query from a colleague not on this list
Two useful and often cited references to Hindu/Buddhist cosmology with abundant illustrations are:
Kirfel, Willibald. 1920. Die Kosmographie Der Inder. Bonn: Kurt Schroeder.           
Sadakata Akira ???. 1985. ??????: ???????????. ??: ???.          
Kirfel had a work devoted to the cosmology in Pur??a which should of particular relevance to the query:
Kirfel, Willibald. 1954. Das Pur??a Vom Weltgeb?ude (Bhuvanaviny?sa) : Die Kosmographischen Traktate Der Pur??a's. Bonn: Selbstverlag des Orientalischen Seminars der Universit?t Bonn.
