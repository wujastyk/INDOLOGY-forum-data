Thanks to the many other listfolks? generosity with references.

Two useful and often cited references to Hindu/Buddhist cosmology with abundant illustrations are:

 

Kirfel, Willibald. 1920. Die Kosmographie Der Inder. Bonn: Kurt Schroeder.           

Sadakata Akira ???. 1985. ??????: ???????????. ??: ???.          

 

Kirfel had a work devoted to the cosmology in Pur??a which should of particular relevance to the query:

Kirfel, Willibald. 1954. Das Pur??a Vom Weltgeb?ude (Bhuvanaviny?sa) : Die Kosmographischen Traktate Der Pur??a's. Bonn: Selbstverlag des Orientalischen Seminars der Universit?t Bonn.

There's a well-written article on Indian cosmology by Richard Gombrich here:
