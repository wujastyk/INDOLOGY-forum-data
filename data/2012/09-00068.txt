[INDOLOGY] BORI contact
Dear List,
Has anyone had success contacting BORI via email recently? Their email address <bori1 at vsnl.net<mailto:bori1 at vsnl.net>> is no longer active. I get this message: Recipient address rejected: USER IS SUSPENDED.
I know Arun Barve is the new Secretary, does he have a personal email address?
Be grateful for any suggestions,
Joydeep
What, then, is Philosophy?
Philosophy is the supremely precious.
Plotinus, Enneads I.III.5
