Dear LIST Members,
On behalf of the IASS, the International Association of Sanskrit  
Studies, it is a great pleasure for me to announce that our new  
Website was launched on VIJAYADASHAMI, Wednesday, 24th October 2012.

To repeat what the site says: The IASS expressly thanks the INDOLOGY  
website and its founder Dominik Wujastyk for hosting the website of  
the IASS between 2001 and 2008, and the Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan  
and its Vice-Chancellors Professors V. Kutumba Sastry and R. V.  
Tripathi for hosting it between 2008 and 2012.

We also thank Dr Heike Moser for allowing us to use 2 photographs by  
her on Kutiyattam, and Dr Amarjiva Lochan for the others.

The site will be pleased to greet you:

With apologies for multiple postings,

Jayendra
