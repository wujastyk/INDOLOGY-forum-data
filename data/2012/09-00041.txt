hinduism film recommendations
*The Story of India* is a nice series.  I have not used it in classes, but enjoyed it very much.
There is also the film on Tantra recommended by James Mallinson on this list some time ago.  I bought that film and found it enthralling, though the scene involving cannibalism was haunting.
