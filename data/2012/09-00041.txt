*The Story of India* is a nice series.  I have not used it in classes, but enjoyed it very much.

There is also the film on Tantra recommended by James Mallinson on this list some time ago.  I bought that film and found it enthralling, though the scene involving cannibalism was haunting.

(which I love dearly), but our institutional copy is nearing the end of its life and I am certain that much better films have been produced since the 1970?s! I don?t use films very much and Hinduism is not actually my specialty, so I am very much out of the loop on this topic. The H-Buddhism list recently had a wonderful online conversation about good films to use for Buddhism courses and we compiled an extensive list of useful resources. I am hoping a similar phenomenon might take place here. I would be happy to compile all the recommendations that circulate as a result of this query and send them to the list.
