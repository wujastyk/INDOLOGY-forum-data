Dear colleagues, 
 
you are cordially invited to attend the conference:  "Buddhism and the dynamics of transculturality", organised by the Cluster of Excellence "Asia and Europe in a Global Context" of the University of Heidelberg, from June 11-13 2012. The conference will be held at the IWH( Internationales Wissenschaftsforum Heidelberg), Hauptstra?e 242, 69117 Heidelberg. The conference is open to the public; visitors are kindly asked to register with Ina Chebbi (chebbi at asia-europe.uni-heidelberg.de).
 
Throughout the more than 2500 years of its history, Buddhism was implicated in processes of cultural exchange and interaction of considerable breadth, depth and variety, and of lasting impact. Aiming to initiate more sustained reflection on the characteristics, dynamics and significance of these transcultural relations, this conference brings together scholars with a variety of regional specializations and disciplinary foci.
 
Speakers in alphabetical order: Anna Andreeva, Anna Filigenzi, Toru Funayama, Georgios Halkias, Berthe Jansen, Lothar Ledderose, Christian Luczanits, Justin McDaniel, Fabio Rambelli, Alexander von Rospatt, Jonathan Samuels, Cristina Anna Scherrer-Schaub, Dominic Steavu, Ingo Strauch, Markus Viehbeck
