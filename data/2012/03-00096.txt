article needed
Dear Friends and Colleagues,
?
Once again I have to ask your help in finding an article. And, again, from the same publication as (once) before, unavailable where I am.
It is: Vi?vambhar?: probings
in orientology (prof. V.S. Pathak festschrift), vol. 2, ed. Ajay
Mitra Shastri, Devendra Handa and C.S. Gupta. New Delhi: Harman Publishing
House.
On p. 278 and 293 there is an article (articles?) talking about inscriptions/graffiti in Khajuraho. I don't know the author or title of the article, this is all what google gives me. :-)
I would be very grateful for a scan!

Best regards,
