Games - Astronomy and Mathematics
I would like to thank Dipak Bhattacharya, Stefan Baums and Johannes Schneider for the valuable informations they gave me about games Indian and of Indian origin.
I also take the opportunity of this message to the Indology list to announce the publication of Astronomy and Mathematics in Ancien India - Astronomie et math?matiques de l'Inde ancienne (see http://www.peeters-leuven.be/boekoverz.asp?nr=9101)

Jean Michel Delire
