Some new functions in the DCS
Dear colleagues,
a few issues in the last releases of the DCS have been fixed now - thanks 
to those who reported them:
- Function "Nominal forms" on the details page is working again, and faster 
than before. The following overview of references is ordered in a 
comprehensible manner.
- Collocation search has an option for sort order (alphabetical/by 
frequency), which may be interesting for evaluating typical contexts of a 
lexical unit.
- Finally, another larger Sanskrit dictionary (Abhidhanacintamani of 
Hemadri, from the same volume as the other books) has been added to the 
"Book search" repository.
With best regards,
Oliver Hellwig
