non-western philosophy as NOT philosophy
Dear Madhav,
My impression is that Anglo-American philosophers of the last century  
were more concerned with distinguishing philosophy from science than  
from religion. It seemed obvious to them that it is not religion,  
since it does not accept revelation as evidence. But they worried  
about what role remained for philosophy after so many of the  
disciplines that were traditionally part of it (physics, astronomy,  
psychology) had been taken over by the exact sciences. Noteworthy  
statements are: the last chapter in B. Russell's "The Problems of  
Philosophy," titled "The Value of Philosophy"; Isaiah Berlin's essay  
"The Purpose of Philosophy" (contained in "Concepts and Categories").  
Also G. E. Moore's "What is Philosophy?" in "Some Main Problems of  
Philosophy." Others will have other suggestions. These accessible and  
lucidly written attempts to define philosophy (there is of course no  
universally accepted definition) would be very helpful for students  
wondering how it is different from religion.
