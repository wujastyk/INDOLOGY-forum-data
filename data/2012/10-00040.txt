Narmada and Narbada
Does anyone know the phonological reasons for the alternation of the river
name 'Narmada' as 'Narbada'? I also see this river name sometimes being
spelled as Narbedda.
It is surprising to see a labial nasal winding up as an oral stop. Is there
any historical evidence to believe in a transformation of narmada > narvada
in the New Indo-Aryan (NIA) languages of East and Central India.
I appreciate any responses.
