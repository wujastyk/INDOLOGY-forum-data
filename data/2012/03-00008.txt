Dear list,
A journalist from the Hindu newspaper has contacted me asking to be put in
touch with one or two Sanskrit scholars in Germany. He will be in Germany
over the next few days on a press delegation and would be keen to meet and
interview them.
If anyone who fits the bill wouldn't mind speaking to him, please let me
know and I will put you directly in touch with him.
Thank you
Venetia
