Gombrich's article is very good. I have a more recent one that deals 
especially with Hindu cosmology from the Vedas to the present. Both 
articles can be used together. It is not yet available online, but your 
colleague can contact me directly.

Gonz?lez-Reimann, Luis. 2009. Cosmic Cycles, Cosmology and Cosmography. 
In /Brill's Encyclopedia of Hinduism/, 1, ed. in chief Knut A. Jacobsen, 
411-28. Leiden: Brill.


For details of the different early Indian cosmologies and the 
interaction between Buddhist and Hindu ideas on the subject, the 
following book by Sircar is very useful.

Sircar, D. C. 1967. /Cosmography and Geography in Early Indian 
Literature/. Calcutta.

For Buddhist cosmology, there is this book:

Kongtrul Lodro Tay?, Jamgon. 1995. /Myriad Worlds: Buddhist Cosmology in 
Abhidharma, Kalacakra and Dzog-Chen/. Ithaca, New York: Snow Lion 
Publications.
