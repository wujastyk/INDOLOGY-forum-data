Effects of Title VI cuts in US Area Studies
dear Madhav,
Actually, although the rationale of this always escaped me, what you wrote
is not quite so: I indeed received two years of FLAS funding to study
Sanskrit with you in the 1980s! The story I always heard is that someone
found a census of India in which some village claimed Sanskrit as their
everyday tongue, and this qualified it under title VI. Whatever the truth
of the story was, it would indeed be difficult to make the case that
Sanskrit is a 'strategic language' in any normal sense of that expression!
Very best, Jonathan
