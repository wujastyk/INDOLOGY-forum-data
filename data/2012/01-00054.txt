transition from Vedic to Hindu religion
Correcting a typo in my earlier post:
later Hindu gods. 
reviling.
Should read: 
 I don't see anything amounting to rejection OR 
reviling.
Re: transition from Vedic to Hindu religion
I'd
 classify Indra's description in Puranas as reviling esp if you contrast
 it to RgVedic descriptions. Otherwise, nothing very dramatic :-)
Compare
 RV "indrasya nu v?ry??i pra voca? y?ni cak?ra pratham?ni vajr?" to any 
Bhagavata Purana's tale of Indra rushing to Vishnu for help in Samudra 
Manthana
Anothing thing I
 might add and that is not mainstream Hindu religion, rather a sectarian
 belief; is selecting those passages from Rgveda which show Rudra to be 
wrathful; and therefore projecting Hindu Shiva as not so prayer-worthy 
as Vishnu.

The sectarian debates between Vaishnavas and Shaivaites do take a rather hostile expression sometimes.

 Re: transition from Vedic

I
 agree that the Vedic gods suffered a loss in status relative to the 
later Hindu gods. But I don't see anything amounting to rejection of 
reviling.
It appears to be a gradual development of religious thought as one sees in similar cases.
I was not aware of the Ganapati/Brahmanaspati conflation. Fascinating.
Best,
Dean
