Monier-Williams for IOS
Dear Colleagues,
Sniffing around the app store today I found something that may be of interest to those among us using the ubiquitous iphone: a nice little Monier-Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary app.

Something to play with over the holidays.
There are other (perhaps better?) ways to use MW on IOS, anybody have a favorite?
Best, Charlie
