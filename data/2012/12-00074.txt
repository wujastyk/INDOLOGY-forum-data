Dear Colleagues,
Sniffing around the app store today I found something that may be of interest to those among us using the ubiquitous iphone: a nice little Monier-Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary app.
https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/monier/id580775858?mt=8
Something to play with over the holidays.
There are other (perhaps better?) ways to use MW on IOS, anybody have a favorite?
Best, Charlie
