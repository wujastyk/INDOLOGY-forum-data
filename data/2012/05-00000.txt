Dear colleagues,
I am trying to understand the following enigmatic text engraved on the four faces of the base of a small bronze sculpture of Vairocana held at the Met (photo of front = [2] attached):
[1] @ prat?tyadharmapa(r?) [2] (ca)nte n?sti dharma?
(svabh?vo)[3]? | (yotyi)tya(s)uj?na [4] te te j?nant(i) dharmat?? @
My efforts to find parallels have thus far yielded nothing better than the following verse, attributed to the Buddha in the Prasannapad?, under 24.19 (cited from GRETIL e-text):
prat?tyadharm?n adhigacchate vid? na c?ntad????ya karoti ni?rayam |
sahetu sapratyaya dharma j?nati  ahetu apratyaya n?sti dharmat? ||
If this verse is in any way related to the one inscribed on the bronze, then the relationship is tantalizing. But since I have nothing better, at least the possibility seems worth exploring. Is the source of the verse cited by Candrak?rti known?
I will be grateful if anybody who has information on the source and interpretation of the Prasannapad? verse could share this information with me. I imagine that it may be helpful to start the investigation by consulting Jacques May's
Candrak?rti, Prasannapad? madhyamakav?tti; douze chapitres traduits du sanscrit et du tib?tain, accompagn?s d'une introduction, de notes et d'une ?dition critique de la version tib?taine (Paris: Adrien-Maisonneuve, 1959),
and if anybody has access to a pdf of this work, then I would much appreciate being allowed to benefit from that too.
Thank you.
