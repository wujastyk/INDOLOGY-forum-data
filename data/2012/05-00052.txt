Mysticism
11 5 12
Secondary class students of Sanskrit are taught two examples
on P??ini 1.3.31 spardh?y?m ??a??? hve takes the middle ending
when challenge is meant? : Mallo mallam ?hvayate ?the wrestler
challenges (his rival) wrestler i.e. throws down the gauntlet.? And ch?tra?
ch?tram ?hvayati ?the students calls (another) student? So spardh? fits
the bill. Another Vedic word is ??dhy? in ya? ?ardhate n?nudad?ti ??dhy?m.

Re: [INDOLOGY] Mysticism
Similarly we have another word which does probably does not find a match in Sanskrit - CHALLENGE!
what could be the sanskrit term for this ? Do we have any word even in other Indian Languages?
