Charles-Louis Fabri article
Dear Friends and Colleague,
?
Does anybody has access to the article by Charles-Louis Fabri: The fulfilment of the Baroque at Khajuraho?
Published in 'Homage to Khajuraho', ed. by Mulk Raj Anand, 1968, Marg.
The version in Leiden does not contain Fabri's article.
?
Thanks!
