The INDOLOGY.info website is being blacked out
<http://protestsopa.org/>today, in solidarity with Wikipedia and the
other public sites that are
protesting against SOPA and PIPA legislation efforts in the USA.  Although
it looks as though SOPA may now be dead, efforts in this direction have not
stopped.
