Dear Vanessa and colleagues,

*The Story of India* has been recommended to me several times, but I have only seen the trailer.  It looks very promising.  Here is a link: <http://www.pbs.org/thestoryofindia/>.

Dear colleagues,

I am looking for a few new film recommendations for my Introduction to Hinduism course. I am embarrassed to admit that I still use the ?Long Search Series? (which I love dearly), but our institutional copy is nearing the end of its life and I am certain that much better films have been produced since the 1970?s! I don?t use films very much and Hinduism is not actually my specialty, so I am very much out of the loop on this topic. The H-Buddhism list recently had a wonderful online conversation about good films to use for Buddhism courses and we compiled an extensive list of useful resources. I am hoping a similar phenomenon might take place here. I would be happy to compile all the recommendations that circulate as a result of this query and send them to the list.

Sincerely,
