Query
Dear All:
A scholar not on our list has asked me a question to which I have no ready answer. The query is:
I have not seen a reference to this number in the literature I know. Perhaps it is from a Buddhist source. Any help would be welcome.
She also had a query about the Tamil custom of "feeding a thousand souls" -- any ideas about where this could come from?
Thank.
Patrick
