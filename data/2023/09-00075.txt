This is my sad duty to announce that Bruno Dagens passed away on September 17, 2023, at the age of 88. He had been professor at the university Paris 3/Sorbonne Nouvelle, for long time member of the IASS till now, and former treasurer of the IASS, before myself. He has been constantly devoted to Sanskrit studies.
Best regards,    Georges
