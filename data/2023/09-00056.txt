Unlock the World of Jain Literature: Introducing JainGPT.org -
Semantic Search
*Announcing JainGPT ? A Semantic search for Jain literature*
*(chatgpt for Jain Literature)*
We are thrilled to unveil our latest achievement: *JainGPT.org*, a website
powered by Semantic search & Machine Learning, dedicated to Jain
literature. Our team member, *Anish Visaria* has been hard at work,
processing an immense collection of over half a million pages of literary
texts. The outcome of these efforts is nothing short of remarkable - a
robust semantic search capability, akin to the incredible ChatGPT by
OpenAI. This feature allows you to delve deep into Jain texts, making it
easier than ever to uncover their true meanings.
Here's how you can experience the magic of JainGPT
1.    *Visit us at JainGPT.org <http://jaingpt.org>*
2.    Simply *type your question* or use the provided examples in the
prompt box.
3.    In no time, you'll receive chat responses that convey the *semantic
meanings* you seek along with source reference.
4.    Click on the *source* page links to access the exact page and book
files on jainelibrary.org
Please note that our system primarily supports *English queries* at the
moment. However, it's now equipped to *extract basic meaning* from Hindi,
Gujarati, and Sanskrit.
But that's not all! We have exciting plans for the future:
   1. *Content Refinement*: We're dedicated to elevating the quality of our
   JaineLibrary OCRed book content. To achieve this, we'll be using
   cutting-edge Language Models like GPT3.5 and Llama 2 to clean and organize
   the material. This refined content will be readily available on JainGPT,
   enhancing accessibility and usability.
   2. *Generative Responses*: We understand the unique challenges posed by
   Jain vocabulary and context limitations. Yet, we're exploring the
   possibility of enabling generative responses using Language Models on
   JainGPT. This, of course, hinges on achieving the required accuracy levels
   and usefulness.
*Few examples* of our search and results it provides?
1.    Why do Jains do paryushan?
?         The purpose of life according to Jain teachings is to realize
oneself, as well as to experience wholeness, peace, compassion, and
reverence for all life. Therefore, the real purpose of Paryushan is to
purify our soul by observing and correcting our own faults, asking for
forgiveness for the mistakes we have committed, and taking vows to minimize
our faults. During Paryushan we should strive to minimize our worldly
affairs so that we can.
?         Paryushan Parva is the most important festival of Jains. During
that eight-day period, many Jains fast and carry out religious activities.
Paryushan Parva falls during the months of August and/or September. The
word Paryushan is derived from two words meaning, 'Resorting to all round
spiritual pursuit', and Parva means celebration. It is a period of
repentance for the acts during the year and of austerities to help shed the
accumulated karmas
2.    Why should you not eat after sunset ?
?         A widely popular Jain practice is to avoid any food after sunset.
People attribute several reasons behind it including the inability to cook
during night as there was no electricity in ancient times. Some reason was
that it was to avoid insects etc. But, Mahapragva says that the true reason
is far more important and scientific: the digestion of food is accelerated
in the presence of sunlight. Our 1cars-sharir gets its energy from the sun.
?         Jains usually try to eat before sunset since many visible and
invisible lives thrive at night and we are in danger of consuming them.
Eating before sunset also allows plenty of time for the digestive system to
function properly.
3.    Explain Anuyog in simple words
?         ANUYOG (Inquiry and Research) Anuyog means exposition,
description, or explanation. In the Jain Shastras there are expositions of
countless subjects. These have been classified into four kinds. Therefore,
there are mainly four kinds of Anuyog.
?         107. Question-What is this, Anuyog? Answer-Anuyog is said to be
of two types-1. Mools Prathamanuyog, and 2. Gandikanuyog.
So basically, we can just type our questions in semantic words and
respective answers with the sources from the books will show up. Hope you
can utilize it to answer your religious, spiritual and Jain cultural
questions.
Our commitment remains steadfast in improving platforms and projects that
promote Jain literature. Your feedback, from the Jain community and beyond,
is invaluable to us as we continue this journey. If you have any questions
