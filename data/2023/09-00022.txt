https://michaelmeyer.fr/sanskrit. From there, you can search about fourty
Sanskrit dictionaries at once, and you can download various data files I
prepared for this purpose.
My primary motivation for writing the search tool was to allow tolerant
retrieval: you can look for approximate matches of a given term, and you
can navigate between dictionary entries that might refer to the same term
but follow different notational conventions (for instance, the entries
bandha, bandha?, and ba?dha? are linked together).
This is a labour of love I am doing in my spare time, but suggestions and
bug reports are welcome nonetheless.
Best,
Micha?l Meyer
