Historically there are two Indic layout systems that OpenType supports, with the second version, which everyone should be using now, introduced 15 years ago in 2008. Fonts can contain data for both at the same time. The fonts I received confirmed my suspicion that it?s the fonts that only support the first version and not the second that stopped working (i.e. they contain deva script tag but not dev2). That feels like a deliberate decision to drop support for the old Indic shaping and if I had to guess I would start with macOS here.
Can I request you to kindly update the following as well on the thread ?
- The Word rendering is broken for "Siddhanta" font in addition to "Adishila Dev Guru".  Word version 16.76.1, Mac Os Ventura 13.5.2
- I don't see this problem with Libre Office on MAC. Libre Office 7.6.1
- I also don't see this problem with Pages App (from Apple, Word equivalent).
- This rendering is broken after a Word update recently and not on an Apple update.
It appears to me that Word's renderer has broken this font, either by design or by a bug, since I don't see this issue on other similar products on the same Mac.
Thanks
