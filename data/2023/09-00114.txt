[INDOLOGY] Post Vedic revealed literature
Dear list members,
I've wondered for a long time how is the appearance of anonymous post vedic
revealed literature explained within the traditions.
By that I mean.for example with the tantric literature.  We have tantric
texts that are dialogues between a god and his goddess usually starting
with some statement like: "The God said" or "The goddess asked" etc.  and
my understanding is that  tantric  texts like this have been appearing for
over a thousand years.
 Of course we explain them simply that such and such a text was written by
a person or persons unknown at around such and such a date. But how do the
traditions themselves explain this.  I.e all of a sudden a written text
that was unknown before with the words of a god  written down usually
beginnning with some statement like:*?r?devyuv?ca or ??vara uv?ca* suddenly
appeared in our world. And this happened with all this kind
of revealed literature.. Do any of the texts ever say anything aboutt how
and why the text will be revealed in the world of men  or do the
commentators ever say how the text came to be known in the world of men..
Thanks,
Harry Spier
