Dear Indologists,
This is a recent article in the Wire. 
https://thewire.in/religion/bjp-defend-orthodox-position-sanatana-dharma-meanings-dont-matter
Do the Indologists have any comments on the interpretation of the term ?San?tana Dharma? as discussed in the article? 
Thank you.
Regards,
Palaniappan
