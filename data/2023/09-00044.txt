Dear Friends,
I'm trying to find the source of this mention of Dommara acrobats. It is
located on p. 234 of this book.
<https://ia904704.us.archive.org/8/items/in.ernet.dli.2015.52850/2015.52850.Studies-In-The-History-Of-The-Third-Dynasty-Of-Vijayanagara_text.pdf>
Here is the mention of acrobats:
"The Dommara acrobatic feats before the regent R?mar?ja are described at
some length in the *R?mar?yanabakhire*."
Here is the footnote: *The Bharati x. p. 753*
I would be most grateful if someone were to help locate this reference.
Thank you.
All the best,
