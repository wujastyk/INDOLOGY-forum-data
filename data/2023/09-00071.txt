Historically there are two Indic layout systems that OpenType supports,
Can I request you to kindly update the following as well on the thread ?
- The Word rendering is broken for "Siddhanta" font in addition to
"Adishila Dev Guru".  Word version 16.76.1, Mac Os Ventura 13.5.2
- I don't see this problem with Libre Office on MAC. Libre Office 7.6.1
- I also don't see this problem with Pages App (from Apple, Word
equivalent).
- This rendering is broken after a Word update recently and not on an Apple
update.
It appears to me that Word's renderer has broken this font, either by
design or by a bug, since I don't see this issue on other similar products
on the same Mac.
Thanks
