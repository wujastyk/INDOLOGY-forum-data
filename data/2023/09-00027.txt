Dear Indologists,
I have noticed some ??uv?rs sing the first verse of the Cuntarar T?v?ram by splitting the word perum??? by splitting it into peru and m???, which does not sound right semantically. Other ?tuv?rs keep the word perum??? whole. When I mentioned it to a musicologist, he offered the following versions of the verse.
Tiruppa?ant?l Edition
pitt?pi?ai c???peru m???aru ????
ett?lma?a v?t?ni?aik ki????ma?at tu??ai
vaitt?ype??ait te?p?lve??ai nall?r aru??u?aiyu?
att?u?ak k???yi?i all??e?al ?m?
Saiva Siddhanta Edition
pitt?pi?ai c???peru m???yaru ????
ett??ma?a v?t?ni?aik ki????ma?at tu??ai
vaitt?ype??ait te?p?lve??ai nall?raru? ?u?aiyu?
att?vu?ak k???yi?i all??e?a l?m?
Prof. E. Angayarkkanni, in her discussion of the first line of the same verse, considers the line to be of 4 c?rs made up of one ?racaicc?r followed by three m?vacaicc?r (cuntarar t?v?rap p??alka?il icai, p. 104), which gives rise to pitt? pi?aic??? perum??? aru????. Although she does not discuss other lines of the verse, we can see the third line of the verse would not fit the pattern of the first line.
Is there a ?correct? way of splitting the c?rs? Even if such a way exists what would have been the relationship between that and the actual manner of singing by Cuntarar or his followers?
Unfortunately, the Pondicherry T. V. Gopal Iyer edition of the T?v?ram does not give the c?r-based version. Does anyone know if TVG has discussed the prosody of this verse in any of his other publications?
Thank you in advance.

Palaniappan
