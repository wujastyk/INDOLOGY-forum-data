[INDOLOGY] query: roman>devanagari conversion
And if you're comfortable at the command line, John Smith's  ur2ud program (
http://bombay.indology.info/software/programs/index.html) is a powerful
little utility that makes it easy to go back and forth between Devanagari
and Roman transliteration (all Unicode, various encodings).
Best,
Dominik
