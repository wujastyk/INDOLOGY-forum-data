 From October 13th to 17th, 2014, the Department of Indian languages and 
cultures at Ghent University is organizing an Doctoral School on Indian 
Manuscriptology. This Doctoral School is intended for doctoral 
researchers (or advanced MA students) who, in the course of their 
research, are confronted with manuscripts, but have had no specialized 
training in how to properly deal with them, and who would like to 
further explore the possibilities of working with manuscripts. The 
course will include workshops in which participants discuss the 
particular manuscript they may be working with. A class schedule will be 
posted on this website in due course: http://www.india.ugent.be/node/351.
Please forward this information to any doctoral students who may be 
interested in attending. Interested participants should contact 
Noor.vanBrussel at gmail.com.
