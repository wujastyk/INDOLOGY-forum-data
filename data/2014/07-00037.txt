I learned this the hard way too.  Sometimes one takes great care in getting
the terms of a book contract fair, only to have the whole effort undermined
when the publisher licenses the rights to someone else.

However, the folks at Motilal are well-meaning and I cannot imagine that
they would not cooperate with putting things right if you contact them
directly.

Best of luck!
Dominik
