Subject: [INDOLOGY] Traditional/ insider's view of language or dialect status of Prakrits

Most of the responses take for granted that ?Prakrit? is Sanskrit that is
(a) incorrect, or (b) at a further stage of linguistic development, and
interesting sociolinguistic and historical-linguistic insights come from
this definition.

But one way to reframe Dr. Paturi's question is: what are the schemas under
which ?Prakrit? (or ?the Prakrits?) was classified in ancient and medieval
India?

Regarding the use of the word pr?k?ta- in reference to a language (or
dialect), one can consult Pischel's grammar (??1ff.), and V. Pisani, ?On
the Origin of Pr?k?tam and P?li as Language Designations,? pp. 185?191
in *Felicitation
Volume Presented to Professor Sripad Krishna Belvalkar*, Benares: M.B.
Dass, 1957 (completely outdated when it comes to Pali). And my
dissertation, eventually. As far as I know, the earliest such uses, which
are still difficult to date reliably, are in the N??ya??stra (of p??hyam),
in the G?th?sapta?at? (of k?vyam), and in the Sth?n??gas?tra (of bha?it?).
Dr. Paturi might be interested in the classification found in the Eastern
Prakrit grammarians, viz. bh???, vibh???, apabhra??a, and pai??cika.
Acharya?s ed. of the Pr?k?tasarvasva has some discussion of this.
