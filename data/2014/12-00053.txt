[INDOLOGY] Sanskrit phone app
I recently installed the Sanskrit smartphone app by Liberation Philology
<http://www.libphil.ca/sanskrit.php>, and I'm liking it (no connection with
LP).  Like having Skt flashcards in your pocket.  Any other recommendations
for smartphone apps along these lines?
Best,
