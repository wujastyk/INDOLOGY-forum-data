Dear colleagues,
It is with great sadness I inform you about the passing of our colleague and friend Kamaleswar Bhattacharya last night in Dacca, Bangla Desh. He had gone to see his birthplace along with his wife. Kamaleshwar was 85 years old. His son Soudjit informed me this afternoon before leaving for Dacca.
