[INDOLOGY] Visualisation of Buddha/Guru
Glad to help if I can. My impression from my own reading, and from MW, is that Aditya is not common as an adjective.  
As a further note on the Gita, I counted 40 instances in 24 verses where various verbs referring to seeing occur in Ch 11 alone.
Best,
Howard
