Dear All,
thanks for your precious contribution. All the MSS in my possess (both
??rad? from Srinagar and n?gar? from Pune) read -garta unquestionably
indeed. Still, the emendation -garbha is very appealing: besides
palaeographical reasons, the very existence of an ek?yana named
N?r?ya?agarbha seems an interesting track to follow. Moreover, the date of
the Jay?khya MS, though not diriment at all, is at least not in discrepancy
with a possible identification. In the next month I will examine two more
MSS of the Dev??ataka: this could help in solving the problem. I hope I'll
be able, sooner or later, to examine the work of Candradatta, and maybe
draw some interesting conclusion. Of course, there's still the possibility
of many (?) N?r?ya?agarbhas, or of a -garbha and a -garga (granted that
-garta is wrong). I add, for the sake of completeness, that this Kayya?a
was NOT the grammarian author of the Bh??yaprad?pa, but the son of
Candr?ditya and grandson of Vallabhadeva (the commentator of Raghuva??a,
?i?up?lavadha etc.).
Thanks. Best wishes,
