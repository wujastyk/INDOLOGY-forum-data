[INDOLOGY] Traditional/ insider's view of	language	or	dialect	status of Prakrits
Language periodization, just like many aspects of textual periodization, is a perennial problem and only further complicates the picture. There are Prakritic forms as early as the Rig Veda (such as vika?a beside vik?ta, or kitava for expected k?tavat).
Regarding Vedic ?dialects?, there is an interesting paper by Emeneau: The dialects of Old Indo-Aryan. In: Ancient Indo-European dialects, ed. by Henrik Birnbaum and Jaan Puhvel, 123?138. Berkeley/Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1966.

Dear All:
The "prakrit" of Gandhara (the Kushans) had an army, but maybe not a navy.
Language periodization may be an important consideration.
The problem of language and dialect may reside in the terminology itself.
I should stop here.

As Max Weinreich elegantly put it: "A language is a dialect with an army and navy."
