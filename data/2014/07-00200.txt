[INDOLOGY] Article by Wilhelm Rau
Dear colleagues,
I am struggling to find the following article:
Rau, Wilhelm (1980-1981) ?A note on the donkey and the mule in early Vedic literature,? The Adyar Library Bulletin, 44-5, pp. 179-89.
Does anybody have a copy and be willing to share it?
with all good wishes,
Fabrizio
