[INDOLOGY] Grammatical Pun Reference
Dear Sanskritists,
I haven't been able to find a reference in P??ini  grammar for a verse
utilising a grammatical pun. The pun involves turning *ma* into *sa*.
Our teachers are indeed the most accomplished grammarians
who can substitute equality (*samat?*) for ownership (*mamat?*),
turning *mamat?* into *samat?*.
They have the best grammar.
?????? ???????????? ?????????????? ?
?????? ?????????? ????? ???????? ?? ???

I would be grateful for any help.
Many thanks,
