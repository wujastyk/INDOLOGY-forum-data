Subject: [INDOLOGY] Grammatical Pun Reference
Message-ID: <CAKWV_Qd88nyOa-RgPnR-9HEyYQXmx=JUrimpVmqRfirJRTfi0A@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Sanskritists,

I haven't been able to find a reference in P??ini  grammar for a verse
utilising a grammatical pun. The pun involves turning *ma* into *sa*.

Our teachers are indeed the most accomplished grammarians
who can substitute equality (*samat?*) for ownership (*mamat?*),
turning *mamat?* into *samat?*.
They have the best grammar.

?????? ???????????? ?????????????? ?
?????? ?????????? ????? ???????? ?? ???

sutar?? guravo'sm?ka? vaiy?kara?asattam??  |
?di?ya mamat?sth?ne samat?? s?dhayanti ye  ||9||

I would be grateful for any help.
Many thanks,
