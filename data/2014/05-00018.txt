Dear members of the list,
We have the pleasure to announce that the digitization of the complete first edition of the Epigraphia Carnatica at the University of T?bingen has almost finished (http://idb.ub.uni-tuebingen.de/diglit/EC). We are now working to improve the digital version thanks to the many suggestions you offered.
In connection with this project and also with an envisioned project on the digitization of the Gundert legacy, the Department of Indology at T?bingen University is going to organize a workshop on digitization and encoding procedures of textual sources entitled "Paper & Pixel: International Summer School on Digital Humanities in Indology" from the 22.-27.07.2014.
Please find the detailed invitation below.
