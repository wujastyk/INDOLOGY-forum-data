[INDOLOGY] Op-ed
To Dominik's references, may I add Martha Nussbaum, Not for Profit: Why Democracy 
Needs the Humanities (Princeton U Press 2010). Not specifically about the market model 
which misrepresents students as customers, but it does attack the idea that education should 
have economically measurable outcomes.
