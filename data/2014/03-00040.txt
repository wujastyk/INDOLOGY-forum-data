my paper A030 on www.academia.edu<http://www.academia.edu>. From these papers we can
see that not
many more than 100 metres do actually occur in serious
Sanskrit texts
(the higher figure is some 130 metres). These 100 metres can
roughly
be divided into two halves of 50 each with 50 of them being
used very,
very rarely. The remaining 50 metres can again be split into
two halves
of 25 comparatively rare metres and 25 frequently used
metres which
every student of Sanskrit literature should know. They are
the content
of page 6 of my "Brief introduction ..."
These figures contrast highly with what theory teaches. The
most
comprehensive index of Sanskrit and Prakrit metres that can
be found in
H. D. Velankar's (a really great scholar and metrician)
wonderful
edition of Hemacandra's Chandonusasana lists about 1,000
different
meters. However, it is absolutely useless and superfluous to
study all
of them if only one tenth of them does actually occur. It
does not mean
anything if a would-be poet takes one of the additional
metres from a
chandahsastra and uses it only to show his erudition, if
nobody else
knows his particular metre. As Ashwini Deo has convincingly
shown in her
ground-breaking paper on Sanskrit metrics, it is very
unlikely for any
literature to actively use such a great variety of metres.
Even the 100
(130) metres listed by K?hnau and Velankar are not really
different
metres, but can be reduced to a much smaller number of basic
pattens and
their variations, as are Indravajra, Upendravajra and
Upajati, Vamsastha,
Indravamsa ind Vamsamala, Salini and Vaisvadevi, the four
Vaitaliya and
Aupacchandasaka off-shoots etc. etc. By the way, in the
1,130 stanzas of
his Kapphinabhyudaya the poet Sivasvamin uses 43 different
metres, which
is the highest number of metres in a classical work (from
the first
millenium) I know of. Practically all of them belong to my
"50 not
extremely rare metres" category; see my edition, Delhi 2013.
The
Buddhist authors Aryasura, Haribhatta, Gopadatta use not
more than 30
metres in their campu poems. The 150 metres in
Jnanasrimitras
Vrttamalastuti do not mean anything because they only serve
as
illustrations of theory.
In sharp contrast with the predilections of the Indian
metricians for
the increase of the number of metres and the invention of
ever new
varieties stands their neglect of, or silence about, some of
the basic
laws.of Indian metrics that every body knew and followed but
nobody
ever included in the sastras. Pingala teaches four varieties
of vipulas
for the sloka (anustubh, vaktra) metre: bhrau ntau, i.e. bh,
ra, na, and
ta vipula. This might habe been valid for his time. Until
the 11th
century CE no one seems to have noticed that the ta vipula
is virtually
non-existing in classical Sanskrit literature whereas
another vipula,
the ma-vipula, is actually the most specific and most
frequently used
among them. Ratnakarasanti is the first to reluctantly
acknowledge it:
d.r.s.taa makaare.naapy eva.m
Moreover, Indian metricians confined themselves only to the
description
of the syllables 5, 6, and 7 of the quarter, remaining
tacits about the
generally fixed structure of the preceding ga.na. It was
left to Western
scholars on the 19th century to formulate thosee laws that
the Indian
poets intuitively knew and followed already 2000 years
earlier.
The point of my remarks is that the metrical theory as
represented by
the chandahsastras is one thing and the actual practice of
the poets
something quite different. I would like to encourage a
deeper research
on the practical side (as done in an exmplary manner by
Ashwini Deo, on
a high theoretical analytical level) and to devote more
energy to the as
yet only unsufficiently explored question, what the
different metres
meant for Indian poets, what they regarded as their specific
functions.
Ksemendra in his Suvrttatilaka is by far too superficial. I
have written
about this topic but unfortunately mostly in German.
