[INDOLOGY] 9 gate city
Greetings to all,
Bhagavad-gita 5.13 speaks of the embodied soul living in the ?city of nine gates,? nava-dvAre pure dehI.
I believe we find this metaphor in the Upanisads and perhaps other Vedic literature as well. Can anyone provide specific references?
Sincere thanks!
Howard
