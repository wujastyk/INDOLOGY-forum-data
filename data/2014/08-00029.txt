[INDOLOGY] Pali question
Dear Joseph,
The Cha??hasa?g?ti Pi?aka edition (p. 440, line 10) does indeed read ??ki?ca??a? nissito hitv? ma??a??. The PTS edition notes that several of its Burmese manuscript witnesses read "hitv?". However, the King Chulalongkorn edition in Thai script (curiously, also p. 440, line 10) and the Buddhajayant? Tripi?aka edition in Sinhala script (p. 328, line 12) both read ??ki?ca??a? nissito hitva ma??a??.
