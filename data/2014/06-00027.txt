Subject: [INDOLOGY] Announcement of a new publication
Message-ID: <20140611170839.0766.CF0E9E7@t-online.de>

Dear colleagues

I am pleased to announce the publication of the first part of a
remarkable work, Subhuticandra's Kavikamadhenu:

 Subhuticandra's Kavikamadhenu on Amarakosa 1.1.1-1.4.8
Together with Situ Pan chen's Tibetan translation
edited and introduced by Lata Mahesh Deokar
Marburg; Indica et Tibetica Verlag 2014
xv, 588 pp., ISNB 978-3-923776-56-6
(Indica et Tibetica. 55)

Note: The book is distributed not by the Indica et Tibetica Verlag,
but by Aditya Prakashan, 21/8 Ansari Road,
New Delhi 110 002, India

The Kavikamadhenu (composed between 1050 and 1120)  is the longest and
perhaps most important commentary on the Amarakosa. It quotes from
almost 200 authorities and sources. So far less than 20 per cent of the
Sanskrit text is accessible, although much more is extant in Tibet. The
above-mentioned work is based on a precious codex unicus from Tibet. A
sequel, based on a fragmentary Indian manuscript and covering the next
15 per cent of the work is under preparation.
