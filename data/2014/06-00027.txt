Dear colleagues

The Kavikamadhenu (composed between 1050 and 1120)  is the longest and
perhaps most important commentary on the Amarakosa. It quotes from
almost 200 authorities and sources. So far less than 20 per cent of the
Sanskrit text is accessible, although much more is extant in Tibet. The
above-mentioned work is based on a precious codex unicus from Tibet. A
sequel, based on a fragmentary Indian manuscript and covering the next
15 per cent of the work is under preparation.
