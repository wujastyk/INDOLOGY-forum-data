HI, I've just gone thru the online chat with Mac. It was my first time and
was quite good. We shared my desktop and I showed them what was happening
or rather, not...

They also believe it is a problem with a new update. I was given
instructions to run an SMC reboot.

It fixed the problem.


All the best,
