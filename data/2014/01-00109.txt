[INDOLOGY] Annual Reports, ASI
Colleagues,
Has anyone compiled for himself a (complete?) set of Annual Reports of the ASI, that could be shared, or can anyone tell me what will be the most convenient way to compile such a set myself? I have found some individual volumes on Archive.org, but it would be convenient to obtain multiple volumes at once.
Thank you.
