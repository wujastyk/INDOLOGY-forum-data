<? Nasrin lived in exile in Western Europe and NorthAmerica for ten years. Her Bangladeshi passport had been revoked; ? She even hadto wait for six years (1994?1999) to get a visa to visit India...> 
True, but I spoke about this forum - Indology, not of the Westor the East. In India too there are vocal supporters of Nasreen, Fida Hussainand Ramanujan. Their views have been published in many news papers. But theydid so as individuals not as members of ?Indology?. 
As for the idea of East-West divide, I stated facts withoutcasting aspersion.

To what Steven mentioned, in re the Ramanujan case, the (Europe-based) Network of Concerned Historians made a petition in protest, which was circulated on the Indology list by Christophe Vielle:

Of course, as already noted, this was against his essay being dropped from the D.U. syllabus.  The SC declined to ban the essay or the book.

The comment concerning Tasleema Nasreen - suggesting that those in the West stood by
because she is an author of South Asian origin - is particularly untrue. Here are
some relevant comments from her biography in the Wikipedia:
"Leaving Bangladesh towards the end of 1994, Nasrin lived in exile in Western Europe and North America for ten years. Her Bangladeshi passport had been revoked; she was granted citizenship by the Swedish government and took refuge in Germany.[11] She even had to wait for six years (1994?1999) to get a visa to visit India..."
