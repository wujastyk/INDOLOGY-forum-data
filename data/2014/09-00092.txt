 Respected scholars,
 I wanted your help in understanding references given
 after uNAdi explanations.
 My guess was that it refers to uNAdi sUtra numbers.
 But when I checked the following available uNAdi
 works, I didn't find the numbers tallying.
 1. uNAdisUtras with the vRtti of zvetavanavAsin
 (Uni of Madras, 1933)
 2. uNAdisUtrANi
 nArAyaNabhaTTaviracitaprakriyAsarvasvAkhyavRttiyutAni (Uni
 of Madras, reprinted by NavaraGga, New Delhi, 1992)
 3. auNAdikapadArNavaH - perusUriviracitaH (Uni of
 Madras)
 4. uNAdisUtras of the kAtantra school with vRtti
 of dUrgasiMha 
 5. uNAdikoSaH - zrI satyavrata zAstrI
 (cittorgarh)
 6. dazapAdyuNAdivRttiH (The princess of Wales
 Sarasvati bhavana text series no 81)
 I would be grateful if the scholars can take me to the
 correct uNAdi work, or explain something about these
 numbers. (The work of Harakare doesn't seem to mention
 the edition he referred to).
