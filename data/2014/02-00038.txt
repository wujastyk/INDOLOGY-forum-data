>> I have a few questions to ask:
>>
>> Is "garbha" found after a male name in a compound that could serve as
>> someone's personal name or epithet?
>> (The late grammarian Naage;sa speaks of himself as "satii-garbhaja", but
>> in that compound "satii" is his mother's name.)
>>
>> Dr. Stern observes: "A Google search will give you references for this
>> scholar [= Naaraayana-garbha]." I made a Google search in all ways I could
>> think of, but did not hit upon anything resembling "Naaraayana-garbha".
>> Either Dr. Stern was expressing a hope or I need to get a list of the
>> references he found.
>> (The reference in the NCC is based on the published edition. It does not
>> add to what we know.)
>>
>> I had checked Prof. Slaje's excellent booklet that introduces the Sharada
>> script for the benefit of those who do not know that script, but I did not
>> find anything in it that would suggest that "rbha" and "rta"" could be so
>> similar as to be mistaken for each other. I would be grateful for a
>> specific reference to discussions of the Sharada script that suggest such a
>> possibility. Alternatively, a presentation of what the shapes of rbha" and
>> "rta"" are according to Prof. Slaje will be useful.
>>
>> (The details of the book to which I referred in my last post for a
>> one-time confusability of "rta" and "rga" are: OJHA, Gaurishankar
>> Hirachand. The palaeography of India = Bhaaratiiya praaciina
>> lipimaalaa. Delhi : Munshi Ram Manohar Lal, 1959.  Third edition. New Delhi
>> 1971.)
>>
>> It certainly deserves admiration that Prof. Slaje has recollected an
>> occurrence that could serve as an exact parallel to what we find in the mss
>> of Naaraaya.na's commentary. However, Srikanth Kaul' himself does not
>> specify that he has emended the text the way he has because "rbha" could be
>> a miscopying of "rta". Therefore, we are free to think that he took the
>> editorial action he did only for a semantic reason. At the most we can
>> infer that he did not hesitate to emend or did not feel the need to justify
>> his action because he was aware of the confusability of "rbha" as "rta" and
>> "rta" as "rbha".
>>
>> What kind of semantic reason? In the passage concerned, ;Sriivara
>> describes an unceremonious funeral, one in which a body brought in a coffin
>> and covered with a single sheet is simply dumped into a space that exists
>> in/on the ground, although it is the body of a royal person (note
>> "ak.sipat," note absence of any reference to preparation of the burial
>> ground etc.). In such a context, "bhuu-garta" conveying the idea of a
>> 'ditch' or 'trench' seems more appropriate than "bhuu-garbha" (which would
>> connote greater depth).
>>
>> (I could not find any occurrences of "bhuu-garbha" in Classical Skt with
>> our standard reference tools. Apte's dictionary records the word only as an
>> epithet of Vi.s..nu. In many modern Indian languages "bhuu-garbha-;saastra"
>> is used for 'geology'.)
>>
>> Whether we go along with Kaul or view his emendation as unnecessary or as
>> an attempt to improve ;Sriivara's original, does it not seem that the
>> evidence given for favoring the change of "garta" to "garbha" in the
>> pu.spikaa of Naaraaya.na's commentary is not as strong as it may initially
>> seem?
>>
>> I will conclude with a clarification. I take Kayya.ta to be a Kashmirian,
>> but Naaraaya.na (= Naaraaya.na-garga, less probably  Naaraaya.na-garbha)
>> may be from Kashmir or any part of western India to the south of Kashmir.
>> Also, he may not be close to Kayya.ta in time. He could belong to a time
>> when the gotra names began to be used after personal names to identify
>> oneself.
