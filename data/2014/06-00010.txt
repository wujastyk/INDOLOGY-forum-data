[INDOLOGY] Upanisads ed.
Dear all,
has anyone managed to download Limaye and Vadekar's edition of the
Upanisads from the DLI site? I would appreciate a pdf, I cannot get past
page 30 using the DLI downloader. Alternatively, an advice on a better way
to download would be appreciated, Windows platform.
Kind regards
Aleksandar
