[INDOLOGY] Hess' "SIDDHARTHA" in Sanskrit
No, I get it, it was quotation not use.   But I still wanted to put out the
general message, for information and just in case some third party decided
to be helpful in scooping up a bunch of addresses from INDOLOGY users.  I
hope the message gets back to Muni Sheelchandrasuriji, who I am sure is
acting out of the very best of motives, and is simply unaware of how things
are done and not done on the web.
Best,
Dominik
