[INDOLOGY] Controversy over Indian Science Congress to include panel On Pushpaka Vimanas
Aeroplanes are not the only outcome of science of ancient India.
According to a south-asian friend it was PM Mody who in a very recent
speech said that cosmetic surgery was invented in India and gave Ganesh as
a prime example of it!
With ample scope for refining the science, meseems.
Does any one know if the PM was serious about this or was this meant as a
joke?
