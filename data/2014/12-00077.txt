[INDOLOGY] Controversy over Indian Science Congress to include	panel On Pushpaka Vimanas
Thank you. This article states that ?Our  main concern?will be with?Brihad Vimana Shastra [and]?Vyamanika Shastra??
Then: ?Of course, a discussion of whether these?aircraft?existed at all is undecideable within the realm of science and is beyond the scope of this paper.?
Best,
Howard Resnick
