[INDOLOGY] Hitler and MLBD
?Some colleagues have asked for a way to associate themselves publicly with
a protest to MLBD about their publication of Mein Kampf.
?
?I've started the public petition "Motilal Banarsidass, Indological
Publishers in Delhi: Stop publishing and selling Hitler's Mein Kampf" and
you can sign it if you wish to add your name to the initiative.

 Here's the statement, which is extracted from my open letter:
Hitler's *Mein Kampf* is a racist, anti-Jewish diatribe that laid out his
plans for racial sterilization. He carried out these plans after starting
the Second World War and masterminding the industrialized murder of six
million innocents. He murdered Jews, priests, gays, gypsies, and people
with brown skin. History has judged Hitler as one of the greatest criminals
of all time, a true monster.
It has been established by many scholars and historians that Hitler's *Mein
Kampf* was written with the express intent of promoting communal hatred and
violence and with ?deliberate and malicious intention of outraging
religious feelings.? The government of Bavaria, in agreement with the
federal government of Germany, refuses to allow any copying or printing of
the book in Germany, and opposes it also in other countries, because it
promotes hatred and war. Publishing *Mein Kampf* is thus a criminal act
under Sections 153A and 295A of the Indian Penal Code.
Motilal Banarsidass (MLBD) has prided itself on its national and
international identity as an Indological publisher. Now MLBD has decided to
pollute its publication list with a book that is one of the world's most
notorious books that deliberately promotes violence and death, a book that
has nothing to do with Indology.
We, the undersigned, call upon MLBD to withdraw Mein Kampf from publication.

The idea is that in about six weeks, this petition and its signatures will
be emailed to MLBD.
Best wishes
