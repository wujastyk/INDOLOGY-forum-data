[INDOLOGY] What is a "Mana" ?
Your old microfilm is of high interest for Vedic scholars, especially
those studying the Vedic traditions of Kerala, for the Nambudiri Brahmin
Houses mentioned are among the most important houses with Vedic traditions.
The NeTumpiLLi TaraNanalluur Mana represents the rare Vaadhuula school
of Yajurveda and has many  manuscripts of this school, microfilmed,
studied and published by Professors Yasuke Ikari, Masato Fujii and
Mieko Kajihara of Japan- TaikkaaTu Mana is one of the few Vaidika houses
having the right to organise Vedic Soma sacrifices, and Kaavapra MaaRattu
Mana is one of the few families with Soma sacrificers in recent times.
