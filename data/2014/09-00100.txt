Dear Dr Ganeshan,

sure. It was not my intention to challenge this well-known fact.

The statement of Ma?kha seems less well-known (except for a paper I am
leaving aside here for good reasons).
Except for the overall subject of his poem, which may be called "Pur??ic",
the quote as such has in its given context nothing to do with any Vedic or
Pur??ic "tradition". It was meant by Ma?kha as a very personal assertion.
He reverts to it here and there on occasion because he felt committed to
this principle to the degree that he considered himself - and was
considered by his fellows - an exception to the ordinary court poet, and
even made this attitude part of his authorial intention.
It was therefore that I restricted my words about this interesting fact to "
*Ma?kha*" alone and did not talk about a tradition, as I do not know of
such a one.

If you, or someone else, could kindly provide evidence for a Vedic or
Pur??ic background of Ma?khas verdict (~ ~ "Let humans not be praised by
humans, man should praise god alone"), which could be classified as a
"tradition", it would certainly shed some light on the originality of this
Kavi.

Thanks,
WS
