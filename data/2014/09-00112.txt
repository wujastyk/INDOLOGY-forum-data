[INDOLOGY] Working free for Oxford Bibliographies Online
Full sympathy!
Though I have no experience with OBO I have experience of writing for
Indian origin encyclopaedias. The first time I wrote at the age of 26-30 I
was paid nothing by an ancient Government Institute of fame. Next I wrote
for one Hindu Encyclopaedia and paid half of what was promised. The third
time I had an experience with an Institute at Bangalore. They did not pay
anything. None of them replied to my queries.
Only the Asiatic Society, Calcutta paid.
But at present I decline to write for such projects.
Naturally, I have full sympathy for you but think that you are not in so
bad a position as that in which a connectionless, non-influential Indian
contributor often is.
