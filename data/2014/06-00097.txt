[INDOLOGY] Display issues
Dear Dr. Patel and colleagues,
We have seen this problem appear before, and it has to do with some sort of incompatibility between our digest service and gmail. (and perhaps another variable which we have not determined.)
There are two ways to solve the problem, both of which may be done by first logging in into your settings page on the Indology website: http://listoptions.indology.info, where you will see a set of ?Your INDOLOGY Subscription Options? upon login.
1)   	Change the style of the digests you receive ("Get MIME or Plain Text Digests?") from ?plain? to ?MIME?
2)	Set Digest Mode to ?Off", so that messages are sent to your email account as they are posted on the list.
Hope that this resolves the issue,
With best wishes,
Adheesh
