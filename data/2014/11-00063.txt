Dear List members,


I am gleaning information on these two Sanskrit writers.

Vasanta Tryambaka S?evad?e (1917 - )
http://www.worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n85337685/

Brahma?nanda Tripa?t?hi? (1932 - )
http://www.worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n88110544/


Vasanta S?evad?e is a commentator and a poet who has written a few mah?k?vyas, while Brahma?nanda Tripa?t?hi? has edited a number of works by S?evad?e. I do not know if S?evad?e is still with us but I believe that some of you might know more about Brahma?nanda Tripa?t?hi? than what the Internet tells us. I will be very much thankful if anybody could let me know any piece of information regarding them, their disciples/ successors or relatives.

Thank you very much in advance.


Best Wishes,
Rohana
