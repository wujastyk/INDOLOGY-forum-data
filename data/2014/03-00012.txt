I downloaded the ebook and was considering putting it onto my own 
website for faster download for my students here in Germany -- but then 
I read the following, which seems to contradict what you write about the 
public domain:

I suppose this is the real copyright status (which I can understand, 
seeing the amount of work that has gone into it). May we redistribute it 
through other websites, provided we get that permission? In any case I 
can put the Australian URL on my webpages.
