[INDOLOGY] Precomposed characters vs combining characters
This is a challenging endeavor in using computing technology for academic prints. I?ve been through this since 1978 and have learned quite a lot through hardship! 
Things we may have to keep in mind are: 
1. Keyboard input and display on the screen depend upon the specific operating system one uses (IBM, Windows, Mac OS).
2. Most important and complicating thing in all of this is word processing with indexing. I?ve gone through a lot in this process!
No matter how you encode your input/output ? some kind of macro would be needed to convert your input/output when you want to send it to a publisher.
