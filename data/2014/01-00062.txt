Subject: [INDOLOGY] Precomposed characters vs combining characters

This is a challenging endeavor in using computing technology for academic prints. I?ve been through this since 1978 and have learned quite a lot through hardship! 

Things we may have to keep in mind are: 

1. Keyboard input and display on the screen depend upon the specific operating system one uses (IBM, Windows, Mac OS).

2. Most important and complicating thing in all of this is word processing with indexing. I?ve gone through a lot in this process!

No matter how you encode your input/output ? some kind of macro would be needed to convert your input/output when you want to send it to a publisher.  

Regards,
Rajam

I?m using Ukelele for this purpose.

Diacritics can be typed in any order, and the base character must be typed after them. The complete list of the allowed combinations is available here:

With a few exceptions, they are not used in the transliteration of Indian/Arabic scripts, but they are widely used in Italian language (e.g.: ? ? ? ? ? etc.). All of these combinations are encoded by the ?Italiano - Pro? keyboard layout as precomposed characters.

But I hesitate, because I know that only a few word processors (e.g. Nisus, which I'm using) are able to recognize the two different encodings (precomposed and combining characters) as equivalent for Finding/Replacing and Sorting purposes, while the most widespread softwares are not (Word for Mac, Neo Office, Open Office); and this fact would create problems if one adds/mixes text typed with my keyboard layout to an old file typed with the ?Italiano - Pro? keyboard layout.
