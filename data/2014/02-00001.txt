[INDOLOGY] MSS in Sarasvati Bhavan Library
No tips but a story or two.
I have visited the Sarasvati Bhavan Library 3 times (from Kathmandu)  in 1973 and 1974, and have ordered the microfilm of a Vedic text (Kapisthala), paid the fee, gave them a roll of unexposed microfilm and even the developer.  I am still waiting for the film ordered in March 1974 --  for 40 years now.
Two or three years ago their Vice-Chancellor wrote to me asking whether he could publish a text that we had slated for publication in the Harvard Oriental Series.  I answered, well yes -- but first please deliver my microfilm.  No answer.
To quote the then (1974) vice-director of the National Archives in New Delhi: 
"You European scholars always are in a hurry. We are not in hurry--- we have many lives."  --  
To which I answered: "I have only one, so please give me (the film)." 
Then she gave...
Apparently one life is not be long enough to get anything out of the Sarasvati Bhavan Library.
Cheers!

PS, fed up with this situation, I wrote to the G?ttingen Library, who have a copy of the Benares Kapisthala Samhita made for Kielhorn, and asked them for a film/scan. They said they were very busy and it may take some time.  Three weeks later the copy was in my mail. 
One life, indeed.
