[INDOLOGY] Report: 6th Intl. Vedic Workshop
Michael,
I am intrigued by the term 'v?ram recitation'. Can you describe this mode of recitation? In the Cilappatik?ram, the term 'v?ram p??al', i.e., singing v?ram is used. It is also mentioned in Tolk?ppiyam Poru?atik?ram 653. V. P. K. Sundaram, the late musicologist, explains v?ram as two ak?aras per unit time. I am curious how the term is used in the context of Vedic recitation.
Thanks
Regards,
Palaniappan

[INDOLOGY] Report: 6th Intl. Vedic Workshop
Dear All,
from Jan.7- 10, the 6th International Vedic Workshop took place at Kozhikode (Calicut), Kerala. It was excellently organized by the local committee.
This was followed by a tour to Nambudiri Brahmin villages in Central Kerala, where the three Vedas are taught and elaborate Shrauta rituals are performed still.
Both a great and pleasurable experiences! Here my report:
