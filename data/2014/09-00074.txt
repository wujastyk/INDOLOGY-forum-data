Subject: [INDOLOGY] Short phrase in a Sinhala script manuscript
In-Reply-To: <4318A835-DB3C-4405-B6FB-2C6809FEB35D@uts.cc.utexas.edu>

I read diyava?ana magul (ceremony for  making more water) . diyava?ana is 
also the designation for the highest officer at the Kandytemple (Diyava?ana 
Nil?me). The meaning is probably:  May the ceremony of increasing water (e. 
g. perahera) be successful.

Best
