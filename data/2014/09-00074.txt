[INDOLOGY] Short phrase in a Sinhala script manuscript
I read diyava?ana magul (ceremony for  making more water) . diyava?ana is 
also the designation for the highest officer at the Kandytemple (Diyava?ana 
Nil?me). The meaning is probably:  May the ceremony of increasing water (e. 
g. perahera) be successful.
