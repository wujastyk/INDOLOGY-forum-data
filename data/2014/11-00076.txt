The pdf files are now online at:
https://archive.org/details/Levi1923PreAryenEtPreDravidien
https://archive.org/details/Levi1925PtolemeeNiddesaBrhatkatha
Those who prefer to read the first in English may find it here: https://archive.org/details/prearyanandpredr035083mbp. (Somebody else furnished that one.)
I can report that the basic uploading process is very quickly done; it is entirely up to the uploader what metadata are filled in, so I have used some of the same descriptors as figure in Zotero. I don't know why some of the metadata get placed in one place in the interface, while other in another.
I also don't know why the pages cannot be read in the online reader (at least not on my side), but I assume at least the pdf files can be downloaded.
It would be nice to have all of L?vi's articles online like this. But it still feels like a bit too much overhead for each of us to engage in randomly, all the more so because I believe that Archive.org does not effectively control against duplicates of works that have already been uploaded. Maybe we could vote on which Indologists deserve most to be honored with attempts at furnishing their entire lists of publications at Archive.org (I suppose focusing on those from whom  a Kleine Schriften or such has never been compiled), and then work in little groups on individual authors?
Best,

Thanks, Arlo!  I'm so glad my suggestion has been thought to have merit.
But I know it adds quite some overhead, and I think that swapping documents is more important, so I don't want this suggestion to slow down people's helpfulness unduly.
Best,
Dominik

Dear colleagues,
Thanks to Stefan Baums and Reinhold Gr?nendahl, I now have the requested papers (and more). I will heed Dominik's advice and upload them to Archive.org tomorrow, then send the links to the list.
Best wishes,

[INDOLOGY] L?vi (1923, 1925)
Dear colleagues,
Would anyone be able to furnish a pdf of the original French version of the following:
  L?vi, Sylvain. 1929. ?Pre-Aryan and Pre-Dravidian in India.? In Pre-Aryan and Pre-Dravidian in India, by Sylvain L?vi, Jean Przyluski, and Jules Bloch, translated by Prabodh Chandra Bagchi, 61?126. Calcutta: University of Calcutta.
It should be available in Journal Asiatique, t. 203, 1923, pp. 1-57, but this volume does not appear to be available on Gallica.
If somebody could furnish "Ptolem?e, le Niddesa et la B?hatkath?", from ?tudes Asiatiques II, Paris 1925, pp. 1-55, I shall also be grateful.
Thank you.
Best wishes,
