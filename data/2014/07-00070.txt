It is amusing that the edition was printed with this caveat on the title page: For Private Circulation Only.  ???????? ???????? ?
Being in Sanskrit isn't prophylaxis against titillation?  It is not even illustrated!
Well now that it's on Archive, it'll turn up on all the XXX sites.

Ti?

Proving again how amazing this forum is, Andrew Ollett was very kind to send me an edition published in 1900, which I just a while ago put it on Archive.org for everybody's benefit.

https://archive.org/details/Kamasutra-Jayamangala-Commentary-1900

I would also like to thank Profs. McComas Taylor and Kenneth Zysk for their kindest support.


Best Wishes,

Subject: Yas?odhara's Jayaman?gala? commentary on the Ka?masu?tra

Dear All,


I will be very much thankful if someone could kindly either send me or direct me to a PDF copy of Yas?odhara's Jayaman?gala? commentary on the Ka?masu?tra. The English and German translations of the Ka?masu?tra, already available as PDFs, do contain the Jayaman?gala? too but I am after the Sanskrit original. We do have a hard copy of it (Devadatta S?a?stri?'s edition published in 1964) at Oxford but I wonder if anybody has got a handy scanned version of it, by any chance.

Thank you very much in advance.

Best Wishes,
Rohana
