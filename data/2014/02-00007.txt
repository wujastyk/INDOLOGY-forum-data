Subject: with haste to convey a new production

Dear All,

I just heard from my long-time friend,
?? <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghulam_Murshid>
Ghulam Murshid <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghulam_Murshid>, formerly on
the Bangla Lang. and Lit. faculty at Rajshahi U., now resident in London a
few decades already, about his and his team?s new diachronic dictionary. I
had to ask for the title and publisher (they are not here). He wrote:

This is a prodigious contribution to the history of the Bengali language. I
hope it achieves wide notice, here as well as abroad. Here is Murshid?s
