Sul??n would hardly have dumped his father into a ditch, for he was publicly
buried at the royal cemetery in ?r?nagar.
?r?vara was a poet and expressed himself as such a one. That he had indeed
a "womb of the earth" in mind when composing his stanza can be seen from a
telling parallel, where he depicts Zayn's burial as an eyewitness, at the
occasion of which he had been present as well:
*yatra supt? ivaikatra bh?nti p?rve mah?bhuja? |*
*bhart?prem?? dhara?y eva nihit? h?day?ntare* || Zayna-T. 1.7.227 ||
"There, [where] *the Earth had taken them inside* for love of her [royal]
husbands, the previous Sul??ns appeared to be asleep [together] in the same
place."
That is the way a cremation-accustomed Hindu poet conceived of the strange
impression interments left on his mind, when the earth, who is supposed to
have always only one husband (ruler) at a time, takes them all together
inside herself (h?day?ntare = bhu-ga*rbh*e), where they now seem to sleep
comfortably side by side.
I am sorry that I had not clarified the full context in my earlier mail and
so unintentionally caused some confusion. I just wanted to be brief in
pointing out the theoretical possibility that -rbha might have been misread
for -rta, and that an early mislection of that sort may have easily
survived in copies made from such an exemplar.
Warm wishes,

Ego ex animi mei sententia spondeo ac polliceor
studia humanitatis impigro labore culturum et provecturum
non sordidi lucri causa nec ad vanam captandam gloriam,
sed quo magis veritas propagetur et lux eius, qua salus
humani generis continetur, clarius effulgeat.
