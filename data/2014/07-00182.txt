=?utf-8?Q?[INDOLOGY]_asatkhy=C4=81tiv=C4=81da?=
Dear list members,
I am currently becoming more interested in the doctrine of asatkhy?tiv?da
and its critique by later Brahmanical thinkers. The primary sources I have
read (e.g., V?caspati and Citsukha) present it in a confused and rather
unconvincing way, and the secondary sources I have seen are threadbare.
Does anyone know of a good specialist study of this doctrine and its
origins?
Many thanks,
