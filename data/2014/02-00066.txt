"Yoga is big business. Its worth $10bn a year in America alone. Does 
the growth in yoga's popularity, particularly in the West, mean that its spiritual content and religious roots are being neglected? Can yoga be 
practised aside from these roots? Are there even dangers in doing so?Ernie Rea is joined by Jim Mallinson from SOAS, University of London, Suzanne Newcombe from the charity Inform and Ramesh Pattni from the Hindu Forum of Britain."
