Dear Prof Koch,

Your example and illustrations are of course rather curious. They are
unknown to the early 19th c. Newari Vess too (as reproduced by the late
Siegfried Lienhard).

However, even for (older) Pali only, the weighing of woman is not unknown.
In the Ther?g?th? (v. 153), the nun Anopam? (?Unsurpassed?), daughter of a
wealthy merchant, is courted by princes and proposed by merchants for eight
times her weight (Masset 2005: 52, ?huit fois l??quivalent en or et pierres
pr?cieuses!?; and the cty as transl. by Pruitt 1998: 179?180, ?what she
weighs as measured by those who know marks?). For a context, see my "Karma
accounts: supplementary thoughts on Therav?da, Madhyamaka, theosophy, and
Protestant Buddhism, Religion, 43:4, 487-498, with an addendum
https://www.academia.edu/4245222/Karma_accounts_supplementary_thoughts_on_Therav%C4%81da_Madhyamaka_theosophy_and_Protestant_Buddhism

As far as I know, the best recent work on the *t?l?purus?a *belongs
to Annette Schmiedchen:

2003. ?Die T?l?purus?a-Zeremonie: Das rituelle Aufwiegen des Herrschers
gegen
Gold.? Beitr?ge des S?dasien-Instituts der Humboldt-Universit?t zu Berlin
12: 21?49.

and

2006. The Ceremony of T?l?purus?a: The Puranic Concept and the Epigraphical
Evidence. In Script and Image. Papers on Art and Epigraphy, eds. Adalbert
J. Gail, Gerd J. R. Mevissen,
