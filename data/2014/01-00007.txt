[INDOLOGY] Hess' "SIDDHARTHA" in Sanskrit
The addresses of the members of the INDOLOGY forum are not public.  It is,
in any circumstances, a violation of internet
Netiquette<http://indology.info/email/email-rfc-1855/>to distribute
other people's email addresses.
While this Siddhartha translation will be interesting to many Sanskrit
scholars, the forced distribution by wrongly shared email addresses is
absolutely the wrong way to share the work.  Most people will be angry that
their email address has been given to a distributor without their
permission, and correspondingly unhappy to receive this work.  It will
create the opposite of the intended impression.
I would ask all members of the INDOLOGY list to remember that it is a
violation of the list's terms to distribute other members' email addresses.
