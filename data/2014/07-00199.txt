Subject: [INDOLOGY] Searching urgently for a scan/pdf of an article from	Lalit-Kala
Message-ID: <CFFE997F.14E78%julia.hegewald@uni-bonn.de>

Dear colleagues and friends,

For a project in our department we are looking for the following article
which allegedly should be in Bonn but, unfortunately, the volume  is
missing. 

Has anybody access to the following copy of the journal Lalit-Kala and could
send me a Pdf/scan of the article off the list? I would be most grateful for
any support.

Author: Pramod Chandra
Title: "The Kaula-Kapalika Cults at Khajuraho."
Journal: Lalit-Kala
Vol.: 1-2
Year of publication: (April 1955 -March 1956)
page: 103 (really only one page long???)

Thanking you in advance.
With kind regards,

Julia Hegewald.
