[INDOLOGY] Hindi courses at universities in India?
Dear Colleagues
This is tangential to normal Indology business, but can anyone recommend a university in India were we can send our intermediate Hindi language students for Hindi language courses?  Our government regulations stipulate that it must be a university. Our university is looking for an exchange, rather then paying fees upfront.
Thanks in advance
