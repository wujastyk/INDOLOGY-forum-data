Traphagan makes an excellent point.  I have also long maintained - in
conversation with patient friends and colleagues - that "business" is an
entirely inappropriate metaphor for understanding or regulating what
happens in universities.

Anthropologists like Cris Shore and Susan Wright
(1999<http://www.jstor.org/stable/2661148>),
Marylin Strathearn
(1997<http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=5299904>),
Strathern and contributors
(2000<http://books.google.at/books?id=yKSBAgAAQBAJ&lpg=PT2&ots=dV_4fcs3Sc&dq=strathern%20audit%20cultures&lr&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q=strathern%20audit%20cultures&f=false>),
again Shore (2008 <http://ant.sagepub.com/content/8/3/278>), and other
social anthropologists have identified and studied the spread of "audit
culture" and the marketization of higher education since the 90s, and
documented some of its distorting effects on teaching and research, and the
effect of this cultural change on the working lives of academics.

The costs of the audit process itself is rarely, if ever assessed. Nor has
a serious public challenge ever been mounted, to my knowledge, to the
logical circularity of the processes involved attempting to establish
public trust in academic processes, although studies like Power
(1995<http://books.google.at/books?id=oK0QpgVfIN0C>)
do reveal major flaws and deceptions that often accompany a reliance on
numerical and audit-style assessment in general, and even its pointlessness.
