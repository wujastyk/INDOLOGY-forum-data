[INDOLOGY] Narratology
Dear Harsha,
Your student may find something of interest in my translation and study of the Ga?e?a Pu???a.  The Introduction to the first volume and the notes to both volumes have much to say about formal narrative structures.
Here are a few others:
A.Mangels, Erz?hltechnik im Mah?bh?rata, Hamburg, 1994.
Bowles, A, Dharma, Disorder and the Political in Ancient India: The ?paddharmaparvan of the Mah?bh?rata, Brill, 2007.
Renou, L. Sur La Structure Du K?vya, JA, 1959, 1?113.
Alf Hiltebeitel's work is also important here and no doubt there are many others.  You will also find some relevant material in the volumes of the Dubrovnik International Conference on the Sanskrit Epics and Pur??as.
Cheers,
Greg Bailey

Friends:
One of my students is working on Narratalogy in the Indian Tradition.
While we have enough information on how stories are told, we seem to be lacking information on how stories are structured.
Any help would be most helpful.
Kind regards,
Harsha
Prof. Harsha V. Dehajia
