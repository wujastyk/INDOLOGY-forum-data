[INDOLOGY] IIGRS 6 (Sixth International Indological Graduate	Research Symposium)
Dear colleagues and friends, 
Apologies for cross-posting.
We are pleased to announce that the sixth International Indological Graduate Research Symposium (IIGRS 6) will be held at the University of Hamburg on the 6th and 7th of October 2014. We would like to invite all M.A. and PhD students as well as early stage researchers, that is to say those who have completed their PhDs within the past five years, to send their abstracts to iigrsuk at googlemail.com by June 29th. We will inform you about the outcome of your application no later than July 4th. If you would like to apply for separate funding and need the acceptance before July the 4th, please send us your abstract with a separate notification as soon as possible. All papers dealing with any indological research centered around the study of texts in their original language will be considered by the selection committee. For further information please have a look at our website at http://iigrs.byethost17.com or contact us directly at iigrsuk at googlemail.com.
We are currently sorting out several issues concerning funding, accommodation, and the participation fees, and will announce them on our website no later than the middle of April.
If you are teaching at an institution, we would be very grateful if you could circulate this information among your students.
Yours faithfully,
Andrey Klebanov, Jonas Buchholz, Judith Unterd?rfler
