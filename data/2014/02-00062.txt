Dear James,
> I have been informed by my university library that the following 
> volume is unavailable on inter-library loan:
>
> Buddhism and its relation to other Religions: Essays in Honour of Dr. 
> S. Kumoi on the occasion of his 70th birthday, Kyoto, 1985.
>
> I take the reference from Hin?ber's /Handbook of Pali Literature/, 
> which does not seem to name the editor. I am, in particular, looking 
> for Hin?ber's contribution to this volume: 'Epigraphical Varieties of 
> Continental Pa-li from Devnimori and Ratnagiri.'
>
This article was reprinted in Oskar v. Hin?ber's Kleine Schriften, 2
