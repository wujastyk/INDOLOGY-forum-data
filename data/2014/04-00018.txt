Dear Jacob,
One could also consider also that Somadeva is writing after (and therefore responding to) K?emendra; thus could it be that both his usage of the technical term ?aucitya? and his comment on the relative value of kath? (narration) vs. k?vya (aesthetic discursus) were directed towards his predecessor? 
On another note related to your query, I?ve always wondered, and perhaps there are new opinions out there, on whether this ?original Pai??c?? B?hatkath? ever existed. Everyone seems to take it for granted, but is there any actual evidence for its existence as a fixed, circulated text? Or is it simply a very nice meta-story about a storytelling tradition that crossed many language boundaries?including perhaps Persian? 
Best wishes,
Adheesh
