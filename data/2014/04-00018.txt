Dear Jacob,

One could also consider also that Somadeva is writing after (and therefore responding to) K?emendra; thus could it be that both his usage of the technical term ?aucitya? and his comment on the relative value of kath? (narration) vs. k?vya (aesthetic discursus) were directed towards his predecessor? 

On another note related to your query, I?ve always wondered, and perhaps there are new opinions out there, on whether this ?original Pai??c?? B?hatkath? ever existed. Everyone seems to take it for granted, but is there any actual evidence for its existence as a fixed, circulated text? Or is it simply a very nice meta-story about a storytelling tradition that crossed many language boundaries?including perhaps Persian? 

Best wishes,
Adheesh

I am curious to find out whether Somadeva is hinting that he translated the work from the original Pai??c? and/or versified or rearranged its contents. While the former would only confirm what we already suspect, the latter might tell us something new about how he reworked the popular story material he was working with.
