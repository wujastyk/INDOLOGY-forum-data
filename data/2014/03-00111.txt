=?utf-8?Q?[INDOLOGY]_Nalanda_stone_inscription_of_Ya=C5=9Bovarmadeva?=
Dear colleagues,
Does anyone know the present whereabouts of this inscription? Can anyone furnish a (high quality) photograph to complement the attached picture of a rubbing published in EI 20, to help me as I attempt to reread this inscription with special attention to its palaeography?
Thank you.
