[INDOLOGY] INDOLOGY Digest, Vol 16, Issue 15
Dear Ajit --- and All,
Yes. This List is not the place. My sincere apologies, if anyone feels
offended.
However. Two things.
First. Gujarat 2002 pogroms are already history, and - being history - they
are legitimate objects of indological scrutiny.
Second. As a Pole I am extremely allergic to seeing Adolf Hitler's ideas of
ethnic cleansing propagated. In India. Or anywhere else.
