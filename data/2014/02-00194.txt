[INDOLOGY] Kuruntokai 106
Well ? I?ve been staying away from this very nice discussion only fearing that my participation here also would be equated with Medusa?s curse. However, I?m stepping in just to share my thoughts about a few things. 
1. The translation of the Purananuru poem #101 quoted here, especially the translation of the last two lines, sounds a bit odd. 
///arunt?m?nta ne?cam
varunta v????;
?(My heart is, that is) I am satisfied, having eaten my fill. I can?t eat any more!? /// 
2. I stand by my grammatical analysis of arunt?m?nta < arunta + ?m?(r)nta. 
Even the traditional commentators (such as U.V.S and Auvai D. Pillai) did not interpret the phrase arunt?m?nta as arunti + ?m?nta. 
3. One does not have to accept my grammatical analysis, but one could study the whole poem in the context of its theme and situation such as ti?ai and tu?ai. 
3a.The theme is 'praising the donor (p????)' and the context is 'asking for a gift (paricil ka??nilai).' In that ka??nilai (begging/wanting situation) a bard asking for gifts would never say that he has had his fill). 
4. The essence of the phrase varunta v???? which follows arunt?m?nta ne?cam [ne?cam  here is an address form to the bard?s heart] seems to have been neglected in the translation. 
4a. The phrase varunta v???? does not mean ?I can?t eat more.? It means ?do not worry/despair.?

Translation is not an easy task, especially if it?s from totally different languages such as from Tamil to English. Translators have to make a lot of sacrifices and negotiate between the concerned languages. I understood this gimmick when I helped A.K.Ramanujan for his translation work (Poems of Love and War) and David Shulman when he translated a section of the Tevaram [http://www.amazon.com/Songs-Harsh-Devotee-Cuntaramurttinayanar-Pennsylvania/dp/0936115076)].
In my view, translations are wonderful but they are just gateways to access the original texts with no guarantee of 100% accuracy.
