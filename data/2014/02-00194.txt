Well ? I?ve been staying away from this very nice discussion only fearing that my participation here also would be equated with Medusa?s curse. However, I?m stepping in just to share my thoughts about a few things. 

1. The translation of the Purananuru poem #101 quoted here, especially the translation of the last two lines, sounds a bit odd. 

///arunt?m?nta ne?cam
varunta v????;

?(My heart is, that is) I am satisfied, having eaten my fill. I can?t eat any more!? /// 


2. I stand by my grammatical analysis of arunt?m?nta < arunta + ?m?(r)nta. 

Even the traditional commentators (such as U.V.S and Auvai D. Pillai) did not interpret the phrase arunt?m?nta as arunti + ?m?nta. 

3. One does not have to accept my grammatical analysis, but one could study the whole poem in the context of its theme and situation such as ti?ai and tu?ai. 

3a.The theme is 'praising the donor (p????)' and the context is 'asking for a gift (paricil ka??nilai).' In that ka??nilai (begging/wanting situation) a bard asking for gifts would never say that he has had his fill). 

4. The essence of the phrase varunta v???? which follows arunt?m?nta ne?cam [ne?cam  here is an address form to the bard?s heart] seems to have been neglected in the translation. 

4a. The phrase varunta v???? does not mean ?I can?t eat more.? It means ?do not worry/despair.? 


++++++++++++ 

Translation is not an easy task, especially if it?s from totally different languages such as from Tamil to English. Translators have to make a lot of sacrifices and negotiate between the concerned languages. I understood this gimmick when I helped A.K.Ramanujan for his translation work (Poems of Love and War) and David Shulman when he translated a section of the Tevaram [http://www.amazon.com/Songs-Harsh-Devotee-Cuntaramurttinayanar-Pennsylvania/dp/0936115076)].

In my view, translations are wonderful but they are just gateways to access the original texts with no guarantee of 100% accuracy.

Rajam

For many days the bard speaking in the poem enjoyed the hospitality of the king. In Hart's translation: ?Not for one day did we go to him, not for two days did we go to him,/ but though we brought many along with us and stayed for many days,/ he seemed as eager to welcome us as he was on the first day! ...? The bard concluded:

Having pulakkum as a finite verb as you suggested does not make sense in terms of grammar and poetic convention. In that case, 'ta? perum pavvam a?a?kuka t??i' will hang there by itself separated from the conditional 'ma?aiy?m maki?na?ku y?m ?yi?am e?i??' by the sentence 'ma?aiy?? ma?amaiyi? pulakkum'. Moreover, the other woman is never referred to as ma?aiy?? by others in the entire Classical Tamil corpus. Nor does she ever calls herself ma?aiyam or ma?aiy?m in other poems where she speaks. That is why, as shown in the attachment, C?min?taiyar's manuscripts had pulakku ma?aiy? but he published the text with split sandhi as pulakkum a?aiy?. All other commentators accepted that. All commentators interpreted pulakkum a?aiy?m as an adjectival participle too.

> Furthermore, before you present what you think is a example of such a construction, you should look more carefully at it. You refer to the sequence pulakkum a?aiy?(m)from Ku?untokai 164, assuming that pulakkum is an adjectival participle. The relevant lines of the poem read:
> 
> ta? perum pavvam a?a?kuka t??i
> ma?aiy?? ma?amayi? pulakkum
> a?aiy? maki?na?kiy?m ?yi?am e?i??.

> As you might have noticed Eva Wilden is silent about the construction pulakkum a?aiy?(m). Clearly she did not know what to do with it, as is shown by her translation:
> 
> ?When they say we have become such (a?aiy?m) for the delightful man,
> that she of the house is vexed (pulakkum) in her inexperience,
> may the cool great ocean trouble them, friend.?
> 
> I for one fail to understand the situation underlying this translation. Why would this speaker wish that the roaring sea drowns the loud gossip about her affair with a married man? If that is because the gossip is a torture to her, this does not become clear from Wilden's translation. Apart from that, on closer consideration pulakkum is not a participle at all, but a finite verb. Wilden failed to recognize the Sandhi here. When two m's clash, as in anaiy?m maki?na?kiy?m one of them may be dropped. This has also happened in the sequence pulakkum manaiy?m. The passages means: ?if, as they say, I have indeed become his ?housewife?, I in my turn will suffer from a housewife's foolishness as well (have to live with my "husband's"infidelities)?, or something like it.

> In Pu?am 191, the question is how come the poet has no gray hair in spite of being many years old. The answer should really address the past. It is because of the past good behavior of his family members and servants that he does not have gray hair today. That is why he uses the past forms inm??t-, nirampi-, and ka??-. But the past behavior of people involved continues in the present too. This is what the poet chose to show in the case of the king k?kkum. Grammatically, the servants were of the same nature the poet has intended all these years.

> ma?anta?aiyam means literally 'we are of the same nature (the hero) united.' That we are talking about an adjectival participial construction can be seen in pulakkum a?aiy?m in Ku?untokai 164.5-6. That is why Eva is right. 
> 
> Coming to the roots of i??i looking like a waterfall, I have attached a picture showing a miniature version of what Kapilar might have seen. The Ficus variety is possibly different but the behavior of the roots seen here clearly show what we are talking about. If one focuses on the roots and rock, they just look like a white waterfall on a dock rock. The roots of the tree are behaving just like a creeper. They attach themselves to the rock and spread. The roots grab the rock surface and also get into any crevices and ridges. That is why they follow the horizontal line between stones in the photo I sent yesterday. With such a creeper-like behavior, I do not know how anybody steeped in Tamil culture can think of the roots of i??i with the hero. Even a lay Tamil just listening to film songs will associate a creeper with a female as in the film song below.

> If a big tree has to survive on a rock, one can only imagine how strongly  the roots should be attached to the rock. That is the whole point Kapilar is making. The heroine has already made love to the hero and has united in love with him like the roots of i??i attached to the rock.

(in Hart's translation: ?My servants do what I wish?). Here there is a change of subject between the respective clauses: I see, they (act) like that?. This offers an explanation for t?m in t?m ma?anta?aiyam: ?To enjoy a more intense love-making they (t?m) first reject the lover. We women operate in that way.?

> As I see it, the real problem of the poem consists of the construction of two verbal participles, or absolutives, etirko??u and ma?antu, followed by a?aiyam ?we are like that?. The construction is rare but I found one other instance in Na??i?ai 179, lines 6-7 (v??kuva?al? vimmi nerunalum a?aiyal?) about a spoilt girl who refuses to drink the sweet milk her mother gave her, sobbing (vimmi, a verbal participle) and clamouring for more extravagant sweets (v??kuva?al?, a participial noun). Only yesterday the girl behaved like that (a?aiyal?) but just now she ran away with a unknown ? and poor ? fellow. No more sweet milk for her!
> If this is how the construction works, the situation underlying our Ku?untokai poems may be described in the following way. The woman speaking had sulked, her lover had fled away and sent a messenger telling that he does not understand why she was angry at him. She replies that sulking is just part of the play: making love (ma?antu) after a quarrel (opposing the lover's avances, etirko??u, flaring up like fire into which ghee/oil is poured) is special. Compare Sattasa? 522 in the translation by Peter Khoroche and me (Poems of Life and Love in Ancient India. H?la's Sattasa?, p. 115): ?After every quarrel, it's true/The pleasures of love taste new.
