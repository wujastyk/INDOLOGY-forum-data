[INDOLOGY] Hess' "SIDDHARTHA" in Sanskrit
I just received the pdf files of the volume and see that 'Hess' instead of 'Hesse' is given in the publication information of the volume itself, in Roman script.  I guess that 'Hesse' of the original was interpreted somehow as having a 'silent' final 'e'.  Let me note, incidentally, that another Sanskrit translation of Siddh?rtha, by Dr. L. Sulochana Devi ,was published in 2008 (Hermann Hesse Society of India ... Trivandrum).  Therein, the original author's name is written ?????? ??????.  George
