=?utf-8?Q?[INDOLOGY]_sentences_inserted_in_the_RV_padap=C4=81=E1=B9=ADha?=
Dear colleagues,
I?m cataloguing a manuscript containing the padap??ha of the first two a??akas of the ?V (= ?V.1.1 to ?V.3.6). At the end of each s?kta, as well as after the fifth (and fifteenth) ?c in a s?kta, a short sentence is given, that is incomprehensible to me. I paste below here the first four and the last three of these sentences (the underscores stand for vir?mas):
between 1.1.5 and 1.1.6: s?stvabj?nutthay?gammyamana?vannarccan?ddhvana? 
at the end of 1.1: pavasv?nirjane ddhvannasanamann atra nirnnayam
between 1.2.5 and 1.2.6: dhanv?sann?lay?d?n?dhanavannarttan??in?
at the end of 1.2: tat_gatir nnavana? ru??a? sanadannasya na??anam
etc.
after the end of 3.5:  s?da??y?kvar?likhy?kv?k_kannayajanasvana?
between 3.6.5 and 3.6.6: mandeni?k?sir?sain?s?vatyak_kar?anandhana?
at the end of 3.6: yudhice??gar?tunniy?nyak_tasyak_nay???ak?m
Can you help me making a sense out of them?
Many thanks in advance,
Marco Franceschini
