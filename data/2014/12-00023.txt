[INDOLOGY] Orality and memory culture in the transmission of the Vedas: video clips / intended public: students in Indology ...
To explain the unique phenomenon physiologically disregarding the Indian
context may lead at best to downplaying it, and worse even to a theory of
racial difference. Many earlier philologists did not admit the oral
transmission in case of large prose texts like the Br?hma?as. Now the fact
is accepted. So there *was* a unique development in India. As belonging to
this new conscious generation Professor Houben is very welcome.
The contrary views are inevitable but the given aesthetic explanation does
not explain their non-occurrence in early historical China or Greece. There
is no reason to disregard the relatively late emergence of written
literature in India which fits in with the phenomenon.
P??ini's A???dhy?y? is an easy text to remember because of its successfully
structured composition. But see Whitney's comments in the 1880s that Thieme
had to contradict. The A???dhy?y? was not easy for Whitney and Weber. The
actual magnitude in normal language, along with its computer program like
compactness and intertwining of the rules, will be apparent from the K??ik?
commentary. Normally, that is not got by heart. I did not mention Pata?jali
because of his metalinguistic discussions.
Two more points. The pedagogic need and oral transmission both contributed
to the phenomenon. Secondly their continuance in India was most probably
caused by both scarcity and perishability of the normal Indian paper that
is palm leaf in late medieval India and earlier, perhaps, any leaf which
was less durable. Birchbark was expensive for the village scholar.
I tried to treat the matter more extensively elsewhere. I heartily
encourage the dialogue but at the same time can assure that the related
problems and issues are of considerable magnitude not accommodable in a
forum discussion.
