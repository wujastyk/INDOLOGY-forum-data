[INDOLOGY] [RISA-L LIST]  Report: 6th Intl. Vedic Workshop
Palaniappan:
*v?ram *recitation refers to the recitation of mantras by multiple people
in turns. *v?ra-, *perhaps derived from ?vr?- also has the meanings of 'day
of the week' (turn of the day?), again and again (*v?ra?-v?ra?,
v?ra**?** v?re?a)
and occasion *(related to Hindi* b?r-, b?ri* 'turn' [CDIAL
11547<http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3:1:1712.soas>])
etc.
Interestingly, Dravidian *c?ri/s**?ri *[DEDR
2464<http://kolichala.com/DEDR/search.php?q=2464&esb=1>]
shows similar semantics of turn, time, occasion etc., although, I don't
believe these two words are related.
