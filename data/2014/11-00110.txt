Much Thanks to Prof. Madhav Deshpande, I got to know in no time that this is from V?caspati Mi?ra's Ny?ya-v?rttika-t?tparya-??k? on the NS 2. 2. 57. I highly appreciate the precision of his expertise and willingness to help. And this Indology forum is proved awesome once again!

Best Wishes,
Rohana

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Vacaspati Misra's words

Dear List,

I will be grateful if anybody could easily remember the source of the following words of Vacaspati Misra. It must be in one of his supercommentaries but I was unable to pinpoint it.

'ekasm?tisam?rohi??? var??n?m asaty apy arth?vabodhe suj??natv?t.'
[it is because of the easy comprehension of the phonemes which get on a single memory, even if there is no comprehension of meaning (from them)].

Thank you.

Best Wishes,
Rohana
