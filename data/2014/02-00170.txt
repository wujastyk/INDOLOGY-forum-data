Of course. Here are the first two verses of the passage. It's from the
Second Avalokita S?tra in the Mah?vastu.
The word k?r??i occurs in five following verses as well.
This section of the 2nd Avalokita S?tra is missing from the Tibetan
translation.
     dharma? karitv? karik?radharma?
     ?rogyapr?pto care sarvaloke /
     pra?a?san?yo bhavate janasya
     k?r??i dattv? jinacetiye?u //
     akha??a??lo ca ariktadhy?no
     pr?ptv?na sev?? dhanam aprasahya? /
     ?j??? karoti bahuk?? janasya
     k?r??i dattv? jinacetiye?u //
