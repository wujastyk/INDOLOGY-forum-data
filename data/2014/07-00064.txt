[INDOLOGY] Alchemy metaphor
I don't know (without digging about, and I have no time just now).  But if
David says so, it's probably right.  He normally gives his sources.  What I
would say, though, is that the 16 sa?sk?ras are definitely the norm in the
classical picture, so a seventeenth sa?sk?ra is a bit like the seventh
cakra or the fifth veda, a late structural extension of a standard theory.
(Like Einstein to Newton and Schroedinger to Einstein :-)
