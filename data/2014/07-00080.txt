[INDOLOGY] Alchemy metaphor
For those following the alchemy discussion, Prof. Torella offered this
important parallel passage (?Pvv III p. 348):
yad? v? sarvathaiva pradhva?sit? vidr?vit? v? bhavati tury?t?ta-da??y?? . .
.
tan-nija-r?pa-samyag-viddha-kanaka-r?pat?tyanta-jara??p?dita-tatsa?sk?rava?a-p?talat?va?e?a-vidruta-rasa-ny?yena
Which I think confirms what we have been saying about the alchemical
processes here. My first pass at a translation would be:
"or when [objectivity] is completely destroyed or liquified, i.e. in the
state Beyond the Fourth, after the manner of the liquid mercury that
remains after the gold leaf -- i.e. the power of the impression(s) of that
[objectivity]--has been thoroughly digested, its form having been [first]
well penetrated by the innate form of that [consciousness]".
I hope I am correct in taking *p?talat? *as "gold leaf". The sentences
immediately before this one establish that the penetration of (in this
case) copper by mercury extracts the gold (*rasa-viddhat?mra-kanaka-ny?yena*),
corresponding to the Fourth State in which objectivity is covered (*idant?
?cch?dit?*), only its impressions remaining.
I hope Prof. Torella and/or others will correct any mistakes here.
best, CW
