Subject: [INDOLOGY] Vedas: Divisions, Dating and Language

If the Indian tradition is taken as the decisive authority, in fact the
names and main ideas are from tradition, a succinct statement is available
in MadhusuudanaSarasvatii's Prasthaanabhedaa.h. Aided by a few other
traditional compendia it furnishes material to devise an exhaustive
two-dimensional structure. The Vedangas can be accommodated but things get
complicated without new two dimensional structures for them. Unpublished
tho (I hardly get time to arrange the material in a printable form) I
taught these to foreign students for years with positive response.
Two Belgian students stated that the treatment of the subject was somewhat
similar in their country. I could not verify.
The sandhi rules too are two-dimensionally structured and when communicated
well-received by students. But this is on an exclusive plan not applicable
to other divisions of categories.
Was this of any help? As far as I remember the matter came up once long ago.
Best
