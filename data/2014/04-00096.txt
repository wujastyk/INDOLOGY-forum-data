Dear All,

The concerns expressed in the article sent by Patrick and then commented upon by Dominik and Dermot are extremely worrying. In Australia this imposition of neo-liberal modes of organization and accompanying use of language have been going on for two decades and major damage has been done to the university system, and, in fact, to most other public sector institutions. The average vice-chancellor here is earning over $A600, 000 pa and is surrounded by a huge and highly paid entourage. The system has been utterly corporatized such that whenever a new vice-chancellor comes in, many of the deputy vice-chancellors are dismissed. That is, a new broom comes in and sweeps out the old, in the classic manner of the CEO of a large company.  The academic staff always suffer and there is a progressive whittling away of academic positions.

The best book I have seen on this problem generally is P. Dardot and C. Laval, La Nouvelle Raison du Monde: Essai sur la Soci?t? N?olib?rale, La D?couverte, Paris, 2009, which argues that neo-liberal thinking now permeates all institutional thinking.

On a more Indological matter, can anyone recommend books/articles on the uses of bh? and as in Vedic literature. I seem to recollect an article on this by Delbr?ck, but do not have an exact reference.

Thanks in advance.

Cheers,

Greg Bailey

To Dominik's references, may I add Martha Nussbaum,Not for Profit: Why Democracy Needs the Humanities (Princeton U Press 2010). Not specifically about the market model which misrepresents students as customers, but it does attack the idea that education should have economically measurable outcomes.
