Message-ID: <38681413386604@web14o.yandex.ru>


Dear all,
I am looking for  PDF, scan or any electronic form of Guenther H.V., Philosophy and psychology of Abhidharma. Lucknow, 1957 or any other edition. It becames a rarity. I need it for my PHD student who is writing his thesis on the application of the notion 'psychology' to the Abhidharma thought, and myself for my studies of Alexander Piatigorsky notion of psychology. 
Please, help us!
Victoria
