Though I do not work on mss myself, I know how important this kind of work is for the whole scholarly community. So why not try to get some result through a petition as suggested by Dominik?I for one would certainly sign it. 


The petition should probably be worded in such a way as not to make the SBL staff feel threatened or singled out; in this context the theft risks mentioned by Prof Cardona could be mentioned as understood and relevant. A programme of digitalisation could also be suggested, pointing out that it would resolve the problem of theft risks. A good project for the Indian Ministry of Culture itself or for some foreign body, or for a cooperation? Who knows - a petition may stimulate the National Mission on Libraries, a fairly recent institution, to focus some of their attention and energies on the SBL... 


Greetings to all,
Elizabeth De Michelis

Perhaps obviously, I'd be all for such an initiative...
