Dear Walter,

Many thanks for the additional information (especially reference to p. 56 of your book on Sharada script) and observations. 

As I stated in my post of yesterday, I accept your main point that "rbha" and "rta" could be confused. 

By now, I have been given enough evidence to think of "rbha" --> "rta" as a more likely corruption In the case of the Devii;sataka commentary pu.spikaa than the "rga" --> "rta" corruption that I had initially suggested. Attestation of 'naaraaya.na-garbha" in another manuscript and the suggestion of the evidence collected from the Einoo-edited book to the effect that there indeed were names ending -garbha (albeit only in the Tantrik tradition and probably only as pen-names or post-initiation names) further removed my resistance to the "rta" --> "rbha" emendation. 

In an earlier stage of my thinking, I would have liked to get an *explicit* statement from S. Kaul on the confusability of "rta" and "rbha", but such a statement is no longer necessary. That he suggests through his employment of "mislection" that copyists misread "bhuu-garta" as "bhuu-garbha" and may, therefore, be thought of as having in front of them a writing that could be understood either way -- as  "rta" or as "rbha" -- is now sufficient in view of the evidence coming from other quarters. 

About the (reverse) "rbha" --> "rta" emendation in verse 2.209 of ;Sriivara's Raaja-tara:ngi.nii, we should start another thread or discuss the matter when we meet next. You probably are as short of time as I am at present. I leave the choice to you. 

With best wishes,

ashok

This applies of course to actual handwriting only, but not to the abstracted shapes of ??rad? ak?aras, which is why I did not categorize such forms under the heading of "Semi-homographe Ak?aras" (pp. 43 ff), where you therefore might have looked in vain.
