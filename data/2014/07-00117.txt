[INDOLOGY] Alchemy metaphor
About the rasa-viddha-t?mra-kanaka-ny?ya, 
for what it's worth, the irreversible transformation into gold of copper that is described as rasaviddha is indeed an image found in a number of old tantric sources, starting perhaps with the Sarvaj??nottaratantra. Such gold, it is claimed, can never be transformed back into copper, just as recidivism from the state of ?iva-hood is impossible for the soul who has undergone initiation.
The maxim is typically formulated in this way (with some variants here and there, notably for the first word !):
rasaviddha? yath? t?mra? hematva? pratipadyate|
tath?tm? j??nasambandh?t ?ivatva? pratipadyate||
A number of passages are cited in footnote 904 of the translation of the Par?khyatantra (on verse 15.59).
In this stock formulation, by the way, nothing absolutely precludes the translation "penetrated"; but note that rasaviddha appears to be used in the Artha??stra (2.13.3) as the name for a type of gold (not as a qualification for copper), which is arguably evidence of a (rather old) semantic shift for the element -viddha in this context.
