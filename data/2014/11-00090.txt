A bit of correction to my last message (on Maurya).
I may have been hasty in calling the Vi??upur??a etext "full of" typos, 
for which I apologise to its creators. I haven't studied the text in 
detail, but while searching for "mur?" I got some hits that must be 
sur?. However, this only applies to the version input by members of the 
Sansknet Project; both the above errors are corrected in Peter 
Schreiner's version. (Both e-texts on Gretil.)
All the best,
Daniel
