This is with regards to the recent discussion on the list concerning the
withdrawal of *The Hindus*. I would like to draw your attention to an
article by Mukul Kesavan entitled "Penguin's day in court", which appeared
in the Editorial section of today's edition of the Calcutta newspaper "The
Telegraph". It may be of interest to those following the matter.
