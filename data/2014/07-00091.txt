Dear Dr Aklujkar et. al.,

Thank you very much for this. Some brief answers to your questions and a
correction to a minor misreading follow, to which I don't expect a response
as I did note your desire to conclude the discussion.

Your point #4:  Abhinava is definitely thinking of two stages here (as
reading all of ?Pv and ?Pvv ad ?PK III.2.12 makes clear), the tury? stage
which liberates one on the level of ??vara- or Sad??iva-tattva, and the
tury?t?ta stage, which liberates one on the level of ?akti-tattva. This
indeed corresponds to a metaphorical use of two alchemical stages, one in
which the copper is penetrated (viddha) by the rasa, giving rise to gold
[through extraction] (rasa-viddha-taamra-kanaka-nyaayena), and one in which
that gold is digested (i.e. absorbed and dissolved) by the mercury, just as
we saw in the video
(atyanta-jara??p?dita-tat-sa?sk?ra-va?a-p?talat?va?e?a-vidruta-rasa-ny?yena).
The 'tat' in that compound is the layers of limited selfhood,
*pr??a-deh?di-dh?tu?.
*Secondly, I now suspect that the redundant and oddly phrased
tan-nija-r?pa-samyag-viddha-kanaka-r?pat? at which you look askance was
probably a marginal notation that got incorporated in the main text (as
sometimes happens in the KSTS).

Thirdly, we have *p?talat? *and not *pittalat?*. While I understand that it
could be "brass-ness", I think "gold leaf" makes more sense because this is
the second stage of the process, and the *rasa-viddha *does not transmute
copper into brass, surely!  As I'm sure you know, *lat? *in final position
of a compound can just mean "slender, delicate" (as in *b?hulat?* etc.).
The problem with my speculative reading is that I don't actually know
if *p?talat?
*is attested in the meaning "gold leaf".  Dominik? Anyone?

Lastly, re: your point #2, I think you are absolutely right as regards the
use of *vedha *with reference to alchemical operations; but it is not wild
speculation to suppose that in the sphere of more popular discourse,
uneducated as most were in the details of alchemy, the idea circulated that
alchemists magically transmuted base metal into gold using rasa, and thus
the word *vedha *used in a non-technical sense would mean "transmute", even
if technically speaking it is in error.  I see evidence for this hypothesis
in BCA 1.10, and I would bet we could find more in the story literature.
Thus both sides of the debate we've been having would be correct, depending
on the register and genre of Sanskrit literature in which the term occurs.

best, CW

p.s. my attempt at a translation of the passage you cite in full follows,
including the compound that I think is actually spurious, marked by {}.

*ahamity eka-rasena anuvedhe tu, yad? idant? ?cch?dit? bhavati,
bh?van?-s?tmy?d ??vara-sad??iva-sa?vidi iva turya-da??y??
rasa-viddha-t?mra-kanaka-ny?yena, yad? v? sarvathaiva pradhva?sit?
vidr?vit? v? bhavati tury?t?ta-da??y?? ??kta-sa?vidi iva
tan-nija-r?pa-samyag-viddha-kanaka-r?pat?tyanta-jara??p?dita-tatsa?sk?ra-va?a-p?talat?va?e?a-vidruta-rasa-ny?yena;
tad? p?r?a-sv?tantryoll?sa eva deha eva sati api . . .* | In the [process
of] penetration by the ?one taste? that is [the fundamental] ?I?, when a)
objectivity is covered, i.e. in the Fourth state [that arises] due to
becoming habituated to meditative contemplation [on reality] and in which
one possesses the consciousness of ??vara or Sad??iva as it were, according
to the maxim of gold [arising] from copper due to being penetrated by
mercury, or when b) [objectivity] is completely destroyed or ?liquified,?
i.e. in the state Beyond the Fourth in which consciousness attains the
level of ?akti-tattva, in the manner of the liquid mercury that remains
after the gold leaf?i.e. the power of the impression(s) of that
[objectivity]?has been thoroughly digested, {its form having been [first]
well penetrated by the innate form of that [?I?]*}, then c) there is simply
the delightful blossoming of full autonomy, even while the body exists.

* I take the tan- in the compound beginning tan-nija-r?pa- as referring to
cit or aha?bh?va.
