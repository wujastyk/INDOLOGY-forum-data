[INDOLOGY] (no subject)
<... Nasrin lived in exile in Western Europe and North America for ten years.
Her Bangladeshi passport had been revoked; ... She even had to wait for six
years (1994-1999) to get a visa to visit India...>
True, but I spoke about this forum - Indology, not of the West or the East.
In India too there are vocal supporters of Nasreen, Fida Hussain and
Ramanujan. Their views have been published in many news papers. But they
did so as individuals not as members of 'Indology'.
As for the idea of East-West divide, I stated facts without casting
aspersion.
