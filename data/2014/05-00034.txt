And where is Section 295 of the Indian Penal Code?

Whoever, with deliberate and malicious intention of outraging the religious
feelings of any class of [citizens of India], [by words, either spoken or
written, or by signs or by visible representations or otherwise], insults
or attempts to insult the religion or the religious beliefs of that class,
shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which
may extend to [three years], or with fine, or with both.
