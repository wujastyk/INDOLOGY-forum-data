[INDOLOGY] Hitler and MLBD
I see from the April 2014 issue of the MLBD Newsletter that MLBD is
bringing out an edition of *Mein Kampf *by Adolph Hitlar (sic).  It nestles
incongruously between Alonso on the Mahabharata and the Black on the
Upanisads.
?
This was a shock!  My immediate reaction was that I wish furiously to sever
all links with MLBD.  I have already written to Penguin Delhi, asking to
withdraw my book from them because of their scandalous pulping of Doniger's
book.  Now MLDB is publishing "Hitlar."  Has Indian publishing gone
completely mad?
My second reaction was, it's not wrong to publish even Hitlar's writings,
because how else can interested people find out how misguided he was, and
how else can historians combat his ideas.  Free speech and all that.
But my final conclusion is that this is indeed completely inappropriate
because MLBD presents itself as an Indological publisher, and *Mein
Kampf*isn't even remotely connected with serious Indology.  Even
participants in
the "Indology under National Socialism" debate don't really need a new
edition of *Kampf*, surely.
I shall therefore be writing to MLBD in protest in the strongest terms
about this pubication.  I urge all my colleagues to do the same.  If
someone wants to set up a petition, I'll gladly sign it.
Best,
Dominik Wujastyk
