[INDOLOGY] Visualisation of Buddha/Guru
Dear James,
I think the problem is determining when precisely 'visualization' is 
assumed or intended in accounts of the practice of buddh?nusm?ti. The 
following give some pointers:
YAMABE Nobuyoshi , The S?tra on the Ocean-like Sam?dhi of the 
Visualization of the Buddha: the Interfusion of the Chinese and Indian 
Cultures in Central Asia as Reflected in a Fifth Century Apocryphal 
S?tra (doctoral thesis, Yale University, 1999). See especially the 
chapter 'Calling to mind, seeing and visualizing the Buddha: the Indian 
background', pp. 125-184.
Paul Harrison, 'Commemoration and Identification in Buddh?nusm?ti', in 
In the Mirror of Memory: Reflections on Mindfulness and Remembrance in 
Indian and Tibetan Buddhism, ed. by J. Gyatso (Albany: State University 
of New York, 1992), pp. 215-238.
Paul Harrison, 'Buddh?nusm?ti in the 
Pratyutpanna-buddha-sa?mukh?vasthita-sam?dhi-s?tra', Journal of Indian 
Philosophy, 6 (1978), 35?57.
