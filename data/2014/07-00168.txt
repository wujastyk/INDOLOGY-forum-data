[INDOLOGY] Alchemy metaphor
Dear list,
A similar case of transmutation in narrative literature is found in the 
Tibetan version of the framing narrative of the Vet?lapa?cavi??ati. 
There the corpse possessed by the vet?la turns into gold upon the 
success of the young prince Bde-spyod (S?tav?hana) in bringing it back 
to the benevolent ascetic Klu-sgrub (N?g?rjuna). Each time a limb is cut 
from the golden corpse, it grows back out again, thus making it an 
inexhaustible source of wealth destined to be used for spreading 
Buddhist doctrine and helping secure the prosperity of Bde-spyod's 
kingdom when he himself becomes king.
The same theme is rehearsed in at least one manuscript of the Indian 
version of the Vet?lapa?cavi??ati attributed to ?ivad?sa (Poleman no. 
2317; ms. c in Heinrich Uhle's 1881 critical edition). There, however, 
the corpse only turns into gold after king Vikram?ditya has slain the 
now malevolent ascetic (variously described as a yogin, a digambara, and 
a k?apa?aka) who sent him out to fetch it for his own 
magical-ritualistic purposes. The king then states that the limbs of the 
golden corpse shall grow back out again when cut, and that the gold 
shall be used to pay off the debts of the earth.
Both cases, one seemingly derived from the other, present us with 
examples of the transmutation of a corpse into gold; and, furthermore, 
in both cases the transmutation seems to serve the dual purpose of 
providing material wealth (securing the prosperity of the kingdom, 
paying off the debts of the earth) and providing a metaphor for 
spiritual purification (helping spread Buddhist doctrine, paying off the 
debts of the earth).
Best,
Jacob
