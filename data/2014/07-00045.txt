[INDOLOGY] Indian reprint
I was an early author in SUNY's foray into Indian/Hindu studies.  (My 1989
book on karma was, I believe, the first book published in their Series in
Hindu Studies.)  I seem to recall a conversation from long ago that
indicated that, at some point in the book's publishing history, SUNY
reserved the right to sell the publishing rights in India.  Indeed, the
year after its US publication, the book did appear with an Indian imprint,
and I was given a small royalty. SUNY's direct sales continued to be
credited to me, however.
I was quite pleased with this process...at the very least, it made the book
available to a wider audience, and the Indian edition replicated the US
edition more or less precisely, though at a much lower price. I imagine it
also helped SUNY financially, and perhaps even allowed them to continue
with their commitment to the series.
Of course, I agree wholeheartedly with Herman Tieken that he should have
been informed by SUNY of its intent with his work. Still, having our
scholarship disseminated as widely as possible is, in and of itself, a
"good" thing (leaving aside thorny questions of piracy, "open-access" seems
to be the way of the future).
