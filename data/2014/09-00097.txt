[INDOLOGY] Source of "nAdevo devam arcayet"
nAdevo devamarcayet might be a general statement; but in the ancient 
unpublished text of Sivadharma, there is a passage:
na-rudrah. sam.smared rudram. na-rudro rudram arcayet .
na-rudrah. ki-rtayed rudram. na-rudro rudram a-pnuya-t  .. (Sivadharma, 
1: 25)
This idea and the passage may be the basis for all later views expressed 
in the same fashion.
