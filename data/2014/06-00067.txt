=?utf-8?Q?[INDOLOGY]_"Nirvikalpabha=E1=B9=85ga"_of_Ve=E1=B9=87=C4=ABdatta?=
Dear Indology Listmembers,
I am looking for any information about a text titled *Nirvikalpabha?ga *that
is attributed to Ve??datta/V?g??a Bha??a, the 17th-century author of
*Pad?rthama??ana*, *Bhedajaya?r?, *etc.
The only mention of the text I have found is in Anantalal Thakur's *Origin
and Development of the Vai?e?ika System *(p. 361)*. *A list of Ve??datta's
works is given that includes a "Nirvikalpabha?ga." Prof. Thakur writes that
these texts are "available to us," though he does not specify what that
amounts to. The text is not listed in Karl Potter's bibliography of Indian
Philosophy. T.P. Upadhyaya's introduction to the Sarasvati Bhavan edition
of *Bhedajaya?r? *also gives a shorter list of works by Ve??datta, but that
list makes no mention of "Nirvikalpabha?ga."
I would be grateful for any further leads that anyone could provide about
the text and whether there is an extant manuscript. Thank you for your help,
Amit
