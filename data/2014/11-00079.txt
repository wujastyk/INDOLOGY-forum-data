Would any of the list members know if there are any other editions of the
Mah?nirv?natantra not based on the edition of John Woodroffe.  I see that
there is an edition by Coukhamba 2007 edited by Narayana, Kapiladeva.
Would anyone know if that edition is based on John Woodroffe's edition in
the Tantrik Text Series.
Thanks,
Harry Spier
