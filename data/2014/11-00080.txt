There have been editions of the Mahaanirvaa.natantra that are not based on
Wodroffe's edition. Even four decades ago manuscripts of the text were in
plenty available in Bengal's villages and cities in the houses of
traditional scholars. I am aware of an edition brought out around 1934 by
one Mihirkumar Mukhopadhyay or Bhattacharya. I can enquire later.
