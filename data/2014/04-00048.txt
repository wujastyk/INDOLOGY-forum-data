[INDOLOGY] passing of Prof Heesterman (1925-2014)
Dear friends,
Thanks for mailing to the List though I already knew of the sad loss. With
the passing away of this colorful and interesting personality Indology lost
two stalwarts in quick succession -- Kamaleswar Bhattacharya and
J.C.Heesterman. It is a coincidence that both preferred writing on paper
with the pen. So also the late Professor Kuiper.
We shall feel then loss that I deeply mourn
Best
D.B.
