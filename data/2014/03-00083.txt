[INDOLOGY] Churning king Vena
Dear List,
Bhagavata Purana has the brahmans churning at first the dead king Vena's
thigh and then his arms - in order to create a new king.

Would someone comment on the procedure involved and the meaning of that -
certainly - strange ritual?
Has someone worked on the king Vena's story? Any book? Paper?
