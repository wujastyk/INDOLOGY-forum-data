 South Asia studies is a language-based
area study with special focus 
on the social conditions, history,
culture, politics and language of 
modern India / South Asia (including
Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh). 
The programme is offered by the
Department of Culture and Society, 
which involves working with other
language-based area studies as well 
as with anthropology, the study of
religion, and history on research, 
education and communication at the
highest international level.
The programme also works closely with
Contemporary India Study Centre

conferences and seminars, 
attracts visiting scholars from India and
promotes exchange of 
students and teachers.
We offer an informal
working environment and an academic environment 
that supports
cooperation on teaching activities as well as on 
research projects and
international conferences.
The language courses provide students with
the ability to communicate 
in Hindi and are a prerequisite for using
the available written and 
oral sources in Hindi. The language is
regarded as a tool for gaining 
insight into modern India, and language
skills are the foundation for 
research and teaching at the highest
international level within this 
field.
Department of Culture and
Society
 Asia studies are anchored at the Department of Culture and
Society,
