[INDOLOGY] Vedic family recitation traditions
Many thanks to George Thompson, Fran?ois Voegeli, Tim Cahill, Daniel
Stender and Borayin Larios for your helpful replies and great references.
I will be writing back to you individually over the next few weeks to
follow up -- (under some deadlines at the moment).
What an excellent group on this Indology list!
