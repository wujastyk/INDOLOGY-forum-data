[INDOLOGY] Narratology
Dear Harsha,
https://archive.org/details/Dasarupaka has English translation of
Dhananjaya's Das'aroopaka which has an elaborate discussion on how stories
are structured. It is called Pancha Sandhi structure. Each Sandhi is made
up of a combination of an Arthaprakriti and a Kaaryaavastha.
Kaaryaavasthas: aarambha, yatna, praaptyaas'a, niyataapti
and phalaagama/phalayoga.
Arthaprakritis: beeja, bindu, pataaka, prakaree and kaarya
Sandhis :mukha, pratimukha, garbha, avamars'a and upasamhriti/nirvahaNa
There are other ways of analysing plot too in other books of Indian poetics.
Best wishes to your student.
Regards,
Nagaraj
