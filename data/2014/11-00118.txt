Hello Jo,

     Thanks for pointing to reviews of the editions of Mah?bh??ya Prad?pa
Vy?khy?n?ni and the Prak??a of Pravartakop?dhy?ya published in the ABORI.
I have the ABORI volumes in my personal library and will check those
reviews.
     Professor Pierre Filliozat does seem to be referring to V. S.
Abhyankar, rather than to his son K. V. Abhyankar.  I don't know the source
of Professor Filliozat's information that [Vasudeva Shastri] Abhyankar
could not read or write, and had to depend upon scribes.  This does not
appear to be true.  Vasudeva Shastri was appointed as Professor of Sanskrit
at the Fergusson College by the recommendation of R. G. Bhandarkar, and
edited and translated [into Marathi] many Sanskrit works, including the
entire Mah?bh??ya of Pata?jali and the Bh??ya of ?a?kara on the
Brahma-S?tras.  I knew Professor K. V. Abhyankar very well, and he showed
me manuscripts of works written by his father, and I have a photocopy of
one of those manuscripts,  a work  titled Y?ju?a-hautra-vic?ra.  So the
information that Vasudeva Shastri Abhyankar could not read or write is not
likely to be correct.  Best,

Madhav Deshpande
