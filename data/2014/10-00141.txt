[INDOLOGY] Commentary to the Majjhimanikaya
I am tempted by the instant response to my request for Schayer's article 
to send another request for help. I suspect this may be more 
challenging. Does anyone out there have access to a particular Burmese 
edition of the Papa?cas?dan?: Rangoon: Ma??ine Pi?aka Press, 1921. This 
was used by I.B. Horner in preparing her PTS edition in 1934. The other 
two editions she used are relatively easy to locate in various 
libraries, but I haven't been able to locate a copy of this one.
The portion I am interested in is the commentary to the 
Mah?kammavibha?ga-sutta (PTS edition Ps V 15?21), in particular the 
paragraphs corresponding to PTSe Ps V 20,5-21,3. Horner indicates a 
lacuna in this Burmese edition that I would ideally like to verify.
If someone did have access to this and were able to scan the relevant 
pp. I would be extremely grateful.
With best wishes,
