It gives me great sadness to announce the death of Prof. Dr Helmut Krasser,
Director of the Institute for the Cultural and Intellectual History of Asia
at the Austrian Academy of Sciences, in Vienna.    Prof. Krasser was known
to many of us as a leading scholar in the fields of Sanskrit, Tibetan and
Buddhist philosophy, as well as an administrator who enabled the careers of
many other scholars to flourish under his aegis.  May he rest in peace.
