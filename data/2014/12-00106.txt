Perhaps it?s worth remarking that in South Indian languages except Kannada, the borrowed (tatsama) forms of Sanskrit nouns ending in -a, whether masculine or neuter, end in -am (amu in Telugu).  Thus Tamil/Malayalam svargam (corkkam more commonly in Tamil).  The verse is an extremely simple one and might have been composed by someone whose Sanskrit was rudimentary, or the -am could have been introduced by a copyist who was used to saying ?svargam.?  There are many Manipravalam documents in both Tamil and Malayalam where the distinction between the original Sanskrit and the tatsamas pretty much disappears and Dravidian endings are added to Sanskrit and vice versa.

This supports the assumption that in this verse, svarga and svargam are most likely oral/scribal variants, and the origin of the reading svargam could be accounted for in the way you have shown the parallel of sv?du(m) udumbaram.

Instances of such interposing are not common, but they do exist. For want of time and because I did not record them when I came across them, I cannot give a list, but I do recall coming across them. The one which I am cite at present is svaadum udumbaram (Aitareya-braahma.na 7.15?), appearing where one expects svaadu udumbaram.

It is not probable that the author who writes simple, flowing verses elsewhere would suddenly and in one instance only introduce a rare construction.
