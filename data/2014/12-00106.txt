Perhaps it?s worth remarking that in South Indian languages except Kannada, the borrowed (tatsama) forms of Sanskrit nouns ending in -a, whether masculine or neuter, end in -am (amu in Telugu).  Thus Tamil/Malayalam svargam (corkkam more commonly in Tamil).  The verse is an extremely simple one and might have been composed by someone whose Sanskrit was rudimentary, or the -am could have been introduced by a copyist who was used to saying ?svargam.?  There are many Manipravalam documents in both Tamil and Malayalam where the distinction between the original Sanskrit and the tatsamas pretty much disappears and Dravidian endings are added to Sanskrit and vice versa.
