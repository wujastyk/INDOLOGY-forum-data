[INDOLOGY] Indologie
May I please note the commercialisation of my discipline in the USA,
Anthropology, as a fashion shop both online and on-street, as
'Anthropologie'. 
It might even have begun in the EU. Its website is coded both in British
English and in German. http://www.anthropologie.eu/anthro/index.jsp 
Let us hope that the same does not happen to Indologie. 
Best wishes,
Joanna Kirkpatrick
