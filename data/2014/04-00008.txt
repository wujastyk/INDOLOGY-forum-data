[INDOLOGY] Helmut Krasser's funeral
Dear friends and colleagues,
This is to inform you that Helmut Krasser's funeral will take place on April 11 (Friday) at 10:30 am in Vienna's "Zentralfriedhof" (Central cemetery). It is (more or less) easily accessible via "S-Bahn" or tramway no. 71 (terminus). The ceremony is open to all.
I take this opportunity to say how grateful I am to all those who so warmly expressed their friendship and esteem for Helmut Krasser.
