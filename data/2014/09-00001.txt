[INDOLOGY] Narratology
Friends:
One of my students is working on Narratalogy in the Indian Tradition.
While we have enough information on how stories are told, we seem to be lacking information on how stories are structured.
Any help would be most helpful.
Kind regards,
Harsha Prof. Harsha V. Dehajia
