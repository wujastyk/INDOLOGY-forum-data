Subject: [INDOLOGY] Anusvara plus nasal
Message-ID: <21231ddcd9cc6daa2351b543e6eb22c0@fabularasa.dk>

Dear list,

I wonder if anyone could explain the occurence in some Sanskrit 
manuscripts (possibly influenced by vernacularisms) of adding an 
anusvara before a nasal. I have attached three examples containing the 
following readings:

Ex. 1: ???? (???? before sandhi)
Ex. 2: ???????????
Ex. 3: ????

Any suggestions or clarifications would be greatly appreciated.

Kind regards,
Jacob
