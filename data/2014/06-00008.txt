[INDOLOGY] Anusvara plus nasal
Dear list,
I wonder if anyone could explain the occurence in some Sanskrit 
manuscripts (possibly influenced by vernacularisms) of adding an 
anusvara before a nasal. I have attached three examples containing the 
following readings:
Ex. 1: ???? (???? before sandhi)
Ex. 2: ???????????
Ex. 3: ????
Any suggestions or clarifications would be greatly appreciated.
Kind regards,
Jacob
