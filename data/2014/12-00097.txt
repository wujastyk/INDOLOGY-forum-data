I've read these posts, and the websites they refer to, with some wry amusement, and much 
sorrow.

It distresses me not only that such hermeneutically crude interpretations of ancient Indian 
texts abound, from Dayananda Sarasvati to the present, but that the genuine scientific 
achievements of ancient India, in phonetics and grammar for instance, are ignored. They are 
insufficiently spectacular, and take too much explanation, to appeal to Modi and his admirers.

There seems to be a lack of understanding that science is not a set of techniques for making 
things work, nor a set of doctrines, but a set of methods -- including the replication of 
experiments. Part of the blame for this must be taken by the colonial education system, from 
Macaulay onwards, which promoted literary and historical study at the expense of science, 
which would have cost more if it had been pursued as it was in Europe. If only Rammohun 
Roy's demand for "a more liberal and enlightened system of instruction, embracing 
mathematics, natural philosophy [i.e. science], chemistry, anatomy, with other useful 
sciences" (letter to Lord Amherst, 1823) had prevailed, the number of internationally reputed 
Indian scientists would be far greater, and the relation between textual accounts and the 
phenomenal world would be better understood.
