Subject: [INDOLOGY] sad day
Message-ID: <537DEDBB.5080801@sas.upenn.edu>

It is a sad day when a member of this list chooses to insult the 
totality of his Canadian and US colleagues with an ethnic/national 
stereotype and claim such a slur as "truth."  It is the kind of day when 
one has to remind oneself of the many acts of kindness, generosity, and 
collegial sharing of information and resources across cyberspace to 
refrain from hitting the "unsubscribe" option. May the best in us 
continue to prevail!
