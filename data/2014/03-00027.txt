> just six pages the very essentials of classical Sanskrit metrics. On its
> last page you will find a list of the 25 most common Sanskrit metres
> that saves the student the trouble to go through the long list in Apte's
> dictionary. Several colleagues found this draft (originally prepared for
> classes at UC Berkeley) helpful. That is the reason why I have decided
> to make it generally accessible. Any criticism will be greatly
> appreciated.
