[INDOLOGY] Mein Kampf in India/Popularity of Hitler Stories!
That was very fine! I have two additions to make.
When he first published his belles-lettres Ali started with Chacha Kahini
'Anecdotes of the uncle'. Ali was a democrat and also an anti-British great
nationalist patriot.  However, perhaps because of his anti-British
sentiments, initially Ali was not an opponent of Hitler. He himself admits
that it was later when a blue-eyed Kashmiri was taken for a Jew and
attacked by Hitler's musclemen that Ali understood the would be Nazis as an
evil. Ali said these much later long after coming back to India.
In the sixties he was writing again and commented on the Eichmann trial. He
cited quite a few facts pointing to Eichmann's crimes. He had visited
Germany more than once.
How Ali -- admired on both the Bengals for his sarcastic writings,
particularly in my University at Santiniketan where he lived for long --
viewed the British may be seen also in the Deshe Bideshe (In my land and
abroad), a unique document on the rise and fall of Amanulla and Bachchai
Sakao in the thirties. Here Ali does not hesitate to praise anti-British
Russians, both exiled intellectuals and Soviet soldiers!
