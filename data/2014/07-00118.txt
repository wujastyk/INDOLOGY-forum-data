[INDOLOGY] Interview with the new ICHR Chairman
"Yet he accepts the basic Mahabharata story as real history, in all its
supernatural abundance"
-Howard Resnick
This is really interesting. May I know the exact words used by Sri
Madhvacharya with the meaning 'real history' ? That citation will help in
tracing the history of the notion of 'real history' among pre-modern Indian
writers.
