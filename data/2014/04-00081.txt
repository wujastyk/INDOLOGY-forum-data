[INDOLOGY] kanya gurukula
Mataji Maharani Tapasvini founded the Mahakali Sanskrit
Pathshala for girls only in Kolkata in 1893. Since it was a residential school, it might come close to being a kanya gurukul. According to Rohini Gawankar, who
has carried out research on women?s contribution to the freedom struggle in
India, Maharani Tapasvini was born Sunanda Rao, daughter of Narayan Rao, who
was a high official at the court of Tanjore. Gawankar also claims that Tapasvini
was the niece of the Rani Laxmi of Jhansi and took active part in the events of
1857.
