Message-ID: <CF49CA05.2C09%mary.storm@sit.edu>

Dear Indologists,

Greetings from New Delhi.

I am the director of a study abroad program, focused on Indian art history, presently located in New Delhi. As of January we will be located in Pondicherry. The curriculum will still be Indian art history, but now to be focused on South India, As an exciting innovation we will be offering students three language tracks: Tamil, Sanskrit and French.

I would be very grateful if anyone could recommend good language teachers in Pondi. I would also be extremely grateful for any basic help in organising a beginning Sanskrit syllabus (rest assured, I personally, won't be teaching Sanskrit!).

Many Thanks for your Thoughts!

Mary
