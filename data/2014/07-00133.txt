Subject: [INDOLOGY] Interview with the new ICHR Chairman

In terms of comparing myth building and poetics has anyone looked at the
discursive structure of contemporary satsaGgas held by yogis and gurus?

I have been trying to integrate elements of Sanskrit poetics into my
framework for this very purpose. My close reading of poetics and
aesthetics, particularly zAntarasa, resonate as having benefit for
analysing the discourse of this particular field of practice.

I focus on the performativity of satsaGga comparing the guru and poet who
use similar linguistic strategies to entertain and educate their audience.
With the assistance of the subjunctive mood I argue the primary aim is to
invoke the aesthetic appreciation of zAnta. However, satsaGga also serves
many other purposes, one of which is to assist with the creation of
potentially 'sublime and sacred worlds', which I believe is intimately
linked to the contemporary practice of myth building at personal, communal
and national levels.

I find the direction of this thread to be reassuring, hinting to the
possibility that at this early stage, the project might be on something of
a 'right track'. I invite any suggestions as to how this framework could be
developed.

Best

Patrick


All the best,
