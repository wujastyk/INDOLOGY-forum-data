Dear list,
In trying to learn something or other about the source of Somadeva's 
"Kath?sarits?gara" as stated by the author himself, I (like others 
before me) am struggling with the exact meaning of verses 1.1.10-11:
"yath? m?la? tathaivaitan na man?g apy atikrama? /
granthavistarasa?k?epam?tra? bh??? ca bhidyate //
aucity?nvayarak?? ca yath??akti vidh?yate /
kath?ras?vigh?tena k?vy???asya ca yojan? //"
I translate as follows:
"Just like the root (text), just so (is) this; (there is) no passing 
over, however slight [i.e. nothing has been left out]; and the language 
is changed [abbreviated? versified? translated?] only for the sake of 
the throwing together [i.e. abridgment] of the vastness of the book; /
and the preservation of the propriety and sequence is maintained as far 
as possible without destroying the flavor of the story, and (so too) the 
arrangement of the partition [individual parts?] of the poem. //"
I am especially unsure about the intention of "bhidyate" in the second 
line, and "k?vy???asya" in the fourth line.
Any suggestions would be most welcome!
Best,
Jacob
