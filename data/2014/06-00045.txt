[INDOLOGY] Candraananda's Date
Dear Indology Listmembers,
Is anyone aware of any work done on the date of Candraananda, the author of the Vai?se.sikasuutrav.rtti?  
I am aware of Aklujkar?s contribution to the question (Aklujkar, Ashok, ?Candraananda?s Date,? Journal of the Oriental Institute (Baroda) 19.4(1969-1970): 340-341) and that Halbfass addressed the question in his very fine book, _On Being and What There is_ (1992: 79-80, 237, and 262, fn. 2).
Any further information would be greatly appreciated.
Thank you.
Sincerely,
John
