[INDOLOGY] Annual Reports, ASI
Dear Arlo,
Most of them appear to be available at the Digital Library of India (DLI). For a convenient, cross-platform method of downloading and packaging books from the DLI, one may use the ?DLI Downloader? developed by Sourin Sen and Munish Chandel and available on their blog: http://www.shunya.co.in
It uses Java, and for me, at least, works quite smoothly in Mac OSX.
Best wishes,
Adheesh
