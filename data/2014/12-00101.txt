Thanks, Ashok.  On another list (BVP), Dr. H.N. Bhatt pointed out that the
N?radasm?ti has the reading ?c?r?t pr?pyate svarga ?c?r?t pr?pyate sukham.
This supports the assumption that in this verse, svarga and svargam are
most likely oral/scribal variants, and the origin of the reading svargam
could be accounted for in the way you have shown the parallel of sv?du(m)
udumbaram.  Best,

Madhav
