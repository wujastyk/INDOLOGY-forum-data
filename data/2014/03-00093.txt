[INDOLOGY] Harivamsa Purana of Jinasena etext?
Hello James,
To my knowledge there is no e-text of Punnata Jinasena's Harivamsa Purana (I searched for it as well some time ago), but this printed edition in nagari with Hindi translation was not hard to get hold of:
Jain, Panna Lal, ed., tr. (Hindi). 2011. Harivamsa Purana of Acarya Jinasena with Hindi translation, introduction and appendices. 13th ed. New Delhi: Bharatiya Jnanpith.
Best,

[INDOLOGY] Harivamsa Purana of Jinasena etext?
Dear Colleagues,
I am sure I am missing an obvious repository or two, but in a quick search I could not locate an e-text of the above work.
Is anyone aware of where one may be found?
Best Wishes,
