[INDOLOGY] Fwd: Hitler and MLBD
Dear Colleagues,
I am all praise for the noble sentiments expressed. We may, perhaps, also
add the name of Jeanne Corbin (France and Canada) among the fighters
against Hitler. She did not leave an autobiography but one may consult
Louise Watson (1976) on Annie Buller. Unfortunately the relevant writings
are considered taboo in some Western countries.
What strikes me as discordant is that the Indian version of the MLBD
Newsletter, April 2014 does not have any advertisement on the Mein Kampf.
It is necessary to assert if the MLBD authorities in India are aware of its
appearance in the UK. I enquired but have not yet got a reply. But there
are neo-Nazis in the West.
Another point. There are quite a few in the book business who promote the
Mein Kampf. They are of course, free to do so. But List members and their
organizations shoiuld be careful of Amazon etc.
Best wishes and greetings.
