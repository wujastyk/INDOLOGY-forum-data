[INDOLOGY] call for papers: workshop on Christianity in South	Asia
Is this workshop intended only for "post-fieldwork PhD students and early-career researchers working on Christianity in South Asia?? 
Christianity in India first rooted in South India. Many South Indian studies, especially about Missionaries, are available to understand such phenomenon.

Rajam
