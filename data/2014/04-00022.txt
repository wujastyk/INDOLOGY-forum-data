Once again, thanks for the many inputs and references. This time to 
Andrew Ollett, George Hart, Adheesh Sathaye, and Dominik Wujastyk. While 
it may be a while before I can study the Perunkatai in the original, I 
appreciate the feedback from you all. It is most helpful in adjusting 
and expanding my view of the verses in question.
Sincere regards,
Jacob
