[INDOLOGY] Warfare Documentation
There is a great deal of information on warfare in Sangam literature ? how weapons are kept, description of battles (though not as detailed as one might like), the use of drums during warfare to summon fighters and to accompany fighting, as well as many descriptions of cattle raids, which seem to have been extremely common.  There are also described some rituals before and after battle.  I think the details given in the Sangam texts are far more real and less idealized than the conventional descriptions in poets like K?lid?sa and Kampa?.  George Hart
