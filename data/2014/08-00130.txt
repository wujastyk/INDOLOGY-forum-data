There is a great deal of information on warfare in Sangam literature ? how weapons are kept, description of battles (though not as detailed as one might like), the use of drums during warfare to summon fighters and to accompany fighting, as well as many descriptions of cattle raids, which seem to have been extremely common.  There are also described some rituals before and after battle.  I think the details given in the Sangam texts are far more real and less idealized than the conventional descriptions in poets like K?lid?sa and Kampa?.  George Hart

I have examined all the relevant Sanskrit sources including Vedas, Sutras, Epics, and Manu, and drawn on general Buddhist and Jain views on warfare/violence (e.g., Ashoka's regret re. Kalingas, etc, though there may be more in these sources than I am aware). None of these sources document actual battles in any detail and much has to be inferred about military organizations, warfare, etc. Of course, the Arthasastra is our most detailed source on such issues, but it too has little on actual campaigns/encounters. I am interested in firsthand documentation of an actual battle/campaign, rather than anecdotal evidence/mention of wars (perhaps in the same vein as the Anabasis Alexandri by the Greek historian Arrian).
