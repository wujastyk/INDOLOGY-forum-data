The Tamil Peru?katai was probably earlier than Somadeva?s work and is thought my many to be based on the B?hatkath?.  I would think the first thing to do would be to look at that work.  And if you seriously want to study the Kath?sarits?gara and its antecedents, it would be important to know Tamil, as I would think the Peru?katai is an indispensable link.  Note that R. Vijayalakshmy has written a study of the Peru?katai. ? see http://www.amazon.com/study-Perunkatai-authentic-Publication-International/dp/B0006EC8I2. George Hart
