Subject: [INDOLOGY] Request, Frauwallner in WKSO 1959.

Gentlefolk,

I'm trying to re-assemble a collection of articles that was lost some years back and would be very grateful if someone could supply a PDF of Frauwallner's study of Dinn?ga's pi???rtha commentary on the Praj??p?ramit?h?daya, published in WZKSO 3 (1959) pp. 140ff, or so my notes say. I will be able to locate it myself in a fortnight, I think, so if it's not to hand then I will take care of scanning and distributing it; but if someone does have a copy to hand I would be most grateful.

Many thanks,

?WBTD.
