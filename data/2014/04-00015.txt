Book: Forty Essays on Indological Studies
Hi !
I was searching the net and came across your site and read about the forum.
My uncle was a professor of Indology and has written many books. His
daughter has compiled his last written Forty Essays on Indological Studies

two books that his daughter has compiled. Can you suggest how we can get
the two volumes to the international libraries for Indological Studies?
Universities or Institutes?
