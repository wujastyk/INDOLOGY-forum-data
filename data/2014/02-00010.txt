Nowadays, online tools make it possible to compile an international
petition.  See, e.g., change.org, etc. What do we think as a community
about raising a petition to the minister of culture (see their National
Mission on Libraries <http://www.nmlindia.nic.in/>) about the
inaccessibility of MSS at the SBL and the damage done thereby to national
and international scholarship on the history of Indian culture?

Best,
Dominik
