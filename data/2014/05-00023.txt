Subject: [INDOLOGY] Help for identifying the content of a picture
Message-ID: <CAOuG4CbuSYMSPGV64RyQ-GEGfk=NDBxzBGw6=uHUq+-FjEcmHw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Indology Members,

A colleague, who is not a member of this list, would like to ask for help
in identifying the mythological events and/or individual figures that are
depicted on the two wood doors of which I attach a picture to this mail.
Any help is highly appreciated.



With many thanks in advance and best regards,



Philipp Maas
