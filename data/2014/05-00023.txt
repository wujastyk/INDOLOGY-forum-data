[INDOLOGY] Help for identifying the content of a picture
Dear Indology Members,
A colleague, who is not a member of this list, would like to ask for help
in identifying the mythological events and/or individual figures that are
depicted on the two wood doors of which I attach a picture to this mail.
Any help is highly appreciated.
With many thanks in advance and best regards,
Philipp Maas
