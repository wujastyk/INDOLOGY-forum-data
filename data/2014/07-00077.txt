Thank you Prof. Torella for your clarification. One point of disagreement
here: you say "in these contexts *sa?sk?ra? *always refers to the residual
traces left by ?inferior? realities on the way of their being progressively
overcome", but we have a clear example to the contrary in K?emar?ja's P.H.
s?tra 19 and comm, where *sam?dhi-sa?sk?ra *clearly refers to a beneficial
and desirable *sa?sk?ra.* But that aside, I propose a different
reading of *tatsa?sk?ra?
