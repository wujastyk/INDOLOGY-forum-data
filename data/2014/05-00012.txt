Hello Patrick,
     Since I don't have a quote from this Ek?da??nir?aya, I cannot verify
if this is the same as a section of the K?lanir?aya.  Aufrecht (CC, p. 65)
refers to an 8 verse Ek?da??nir?aya of M?dhava, with the alternative name
M?dhavak?rik?, and says that this is listed in the Catalogue of Sanskrit
Manuscripts in the Punjab University Library, Lahore, Vol. I, 1932 (p. 97).
