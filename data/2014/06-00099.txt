Dear Marco,
I have encountered the same kind of "sentence" in a MS of a part the
Tivviyappirapantam: it is made by putting in a series the first syllable
(or more) of each of the stanzas making a pacuram plus the first syllable
(or more) of the first stanza of the next pacuram.
Interestingly these "chains" are sometimes reproduced in the printed
editions.
Maybe members in this list might know the technical name in Tamil for such
"chains".
With best wishes.
