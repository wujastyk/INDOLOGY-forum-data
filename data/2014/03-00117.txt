Dear Prof. Rosane Rocher,
I think the easiest way is to contact Dr. Irina Popova who is the head of
the Institute of Oriental Manuscripts (http://www.orientalstudies.ru) in
S.Peterburg. She is also the head of the  Department of Manuscripts and
Documents. I will be happy to assist in case you need any further help as I
know her personally.
The contact details are below:
Institute e-mail: iom at orientalstudies.ru;
