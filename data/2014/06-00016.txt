[INDOLOGY] Anusvara plus nasal
Dear Jacob,
this would seem to include ancient vernaculars, cf. Allen,
Phonetics in Ancient India, p. 40:
   there was a tendency, censured by the R[k]P[r?ti??khya]
   but general in the modern Indo?Aryan languages, for
   vowels to take on some degree of nasal ?colour? in
   contact with nasal consonants.?
   ? RP xiv. 56 raktai r?ga? samav?ye svar???m. Cf. also
   xiv. 9.
All best,
Stefan
