[INDOLOGY] References on women scholars in ancient and	medieval	India
You may wish to take a look at Miranda Shaw, Passionate Enlightenment (Princeton),
but do exercise some caution here: Ronald Davidson, Esoteric Buddhism in India (Columbia),
among others, has sharply questioned the social-historical realities underlying the representations of
women drawn on by Shaw.
Of course, within the Tamil tradition the Cilappatikaram, though not written by a woman,
does include a famous narrative of a woman's study of Buddhist logic.
Several of the Mahayana sutras, e.g., the "Lion's Roar of Queen Srimala," prominently feature
learned women. Diana Paul, Women in Buddhism (CAL), offers further examples.
