[INDOLOGY] References on women scholars in ancient and medieval	India
19 08 14
Dear friends,
The following information may be relevant.
There was, perhaps still is, one Pr?cya V??? Pari?ad founded and promoted
by the late Dr. J. B. Choudhry, formerly Principal, Government Sanskrit
College, Calcutta and subsequently Secretary, Sanskrit Education Council
(Sanskrit Shiksha Parishad, Govt. of WB) and his wife late Dr. Rama
Choudhri, Vice-Chancellor, Rabindra Bharati University. The couple
regularly staged dramas some of which had been written by pre-modern women
Sanskrit poets. The said Pari?ad also brought out quite a few pre-modern
Sanskrit works by women.
The amount of literary production was sizeable. Copies should be still
available but I do not know how to contact the organization. The R.B.
University or Asiatic Society might be of help.
The knowledge of their production came to me like mother's milk and orally.
Many manuscripts with their writings perished in the male dominated ancient
families of traditional scholars.   It goes to the credit of the Choudhury
couple that they tried to bring some of these into light.
I cannot desist myself from citing a stanza which I still remember though I
learnt it in my early youth. It is by a woman poet whose husband had long
remained away on business. It was out of despair that she sent it through a
messenger (and secretly) and got what she desired from a newly charmed
husband taken unawares.

d?yate*//
I do not claim it to be by any of my direct ancestors.
