[INDOLOGY] Fwd:  Visualisation of Buddha/Guru
Re: [INDOLOGY] Visualisation of Buddha/Guru
Dear Discutants,
another *locus classicus, *re relics and their power to help visualization:
Mahavamsa, XVII, 1-3, relics as :
1. Vutthavasso pav?retv? kattikapu??am?siya?
Avove'da? mah?r?ja? mah?thero mah?mati:
2. "Ciradi??ho hi sambuddho satth? no manuj?dhipa,
An?thav?sa? avasimha, natthi no p?jiya? idha."
3. "Bh?sittha nanu bhante me sambuddho nibbuto" iti.
?ha "*dh?tusu di??hesu di??ho hoti jino*" iti.
Wilhelm Geiger's translation:
WHEN the great thera of lofty wisdom, after spending the rain-season
(thus),
had held the pavarana-ceremony, on the full-moon day of the month Kattika, he
spoke thus to the king:
'Long is the time, O lord of men, since we have seen the Sambuddha.
We lived a life without a master. There is nothing here for us to worship.'
And to the question:
'Yet hast thou not told me, sir, that the Sambuddha is passed into
nibbana?'
he answered: '*If we behold the relics we behold the Conqueror*.'
And - Bodhi-tree (bodhidruma, bodhiv?k?a) as a visualization support?
