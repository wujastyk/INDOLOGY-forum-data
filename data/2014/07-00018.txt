[INDOLOGY] AiG I Einleitung
Many thanks, George! I have got the 'Einleitung' that I badly needed. Renou
has indeed made some vital changes even in the main body, I am now
confirmed. I can now also mark how far the end notes have been updated.
I repeat - I have got the part I needed.  So many distant friends!
You need not scan, tho I heartily thank you for the kind offer. I have been
using the AiG a,b,c,d as Hauschild has called them, for long.
I shall be glad to render any help that I offer from here.
Best wishes and thanks
DB
