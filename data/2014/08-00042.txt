[INDOLOGY] Query for E-copy of Madhusudana Sarasvati's	Siddhantabindu
Dear Rohana,
Thank you once again for sending the editions of the Siddhantabindu so
quick. I've downloaded all of them though I'm having them in hard copy.
I'll be looking for those editions cited earlier.
With best wishes and rgs,
Niranjan
