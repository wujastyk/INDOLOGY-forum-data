[INDOLOGY] Alchemy metaphor
Thanks for the reference Dominik.
And, with reference to the Abhinavagupta passages we were considering, we
get a rather clear comment I didn't notice before:
*tad? bodha-svar?p?k?ta? tad-ras?nuviddham eva ??ny?di-deh?ntam avabh?t?ti *
then those [levels] from the Void to the body manifest as [they really
are,] having awareness as their essence, i.e. they are transmuted by the
elixir of that [awareness].
We also get a clarification in the same passage that *viddha, anuviddha,
abhinivi??a, sam?vi??a *all denote the same thing in this context. Though
it seems as if Abhinava uses *anuvedha/anuviddha *when he wants you to know
that he definitely means "transmute".
best, CW
