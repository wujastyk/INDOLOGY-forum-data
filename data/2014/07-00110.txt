[INDOLOGY] Interview with the new ICHR Chairman
While there was no historical awareness in pre-modern India in the modern
sense of history, many genealogies of medieval kings (including the
Bhosales of Maharashtra) begin with the coronation of Yudhishthira, and so
they are treating the epic and puranic lists as historical in their own
understanding of history.
