Dear Colleagues,
I have been informed by my university library that the following volume is unavailable on inter-library loan:
Buddhism and its relation to other Religions: Essays in Honour of Dr. S. Kumoi on the occasion of his 70th birthday, Kyoto, 1985.
I take the reference from Hin?ber's Handbook of Pali Literature, which does not seem to name the editor. I am, in particular, looking for Hin?ber's contribution to this volume: 'Epigraphical Varieties of Continental P?li from Devnimori and Ratnagiri.'
Can anyone help me?
Best Wishes,
