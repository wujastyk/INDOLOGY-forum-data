[INDOLOGY] Russian 14 cent. Birchbark MSS from Novgorod
Does anyone know of any good scholarly discussions of the Novgorod 
documents? They sound like the same sort of thing as the Vindolanda 
(Yorkshire) letters, which present fascinating slices of ordinary life 
back in the day. Nothing comparable from the ancient Indian world, 
unfortunately, although the Niya Kharosthi documents are somewhat close.
