Haifa University Rollins College 
Publisher:
Lexington Books 
 We are seeking proposals for book chapters for our
forthcoming co-edited volume Dharma and Halacha: Comparative Studies in
Hindu-Jewish Philosophy, Culture and Religion, to be published by
Lexington Books. Please send us proposals in the scope of 250 words; our
general expectation is for chapters to be approximately 6,000 words but
please specify the proposed chapter length. 
Possible topics include:
Jewish and Hindu ethics, divinity and divine personhood, the divine
feminine, revelation, Dharma and Halacha, notions and practices of
purity and impurity, the Epics and the Tanach, Tantra and Kabala,
priesthood, notions of holy land, practices of pilgrimage, Kosher and
Suci, erotic spiritual poetry, the Guru and the Zaddik, the individual
and the community, Ayurveda and traditional Jewish notions of health,
and women in Judaism and Hinduism. Other themes in modern and
contemporary studies are also invited such as the revival of Hebrew and
Sanskrit, the exchanges between Gandhi, Tagore and Jewish intellectuals
in 19th-20th centuries, Hindu and Jewish reform movements, feminist and
gender studies, and modern political thought and theory. Although this
volume is focused on Hindu-Jewish comparative themes, we are also open
to consider Jain-Jewish comparative topics such as non violence in
Jainism and Judaism or sustainability and ecology in both traditions.
Please send proposals to:
