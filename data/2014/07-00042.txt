Dear list members
A brief comment: Motilal had received permission from SUNY Press to bring out an Indian edition. The fault lies primarily with SUNY, which did not bother to inform us about it and bring Motilal into contact with Peter Khoroche and me as authors.

Some publishers like the Cosmo Publishers do not even care to reply.after getting a book or a part of a book plagiarized. Even Government publications are reprinted before the expiry of copyright and without any assignment. I know that such things happen in Delhi. The matter came up in the List even before this. Victimized authors should unitedly fight against plagiarisn or robbery of copyright.

I learned this the hard way too.  Sometimes one takes great care in getting the terms of a book contract fair, only to have the whole effort undermined when the publisher licenses the rights to someone else.

However, the folks at Motilal are well-meaning and I cannot imagine that they would not cooperate with putting things right if you contact them directly.

Best of luck!
Dominik
