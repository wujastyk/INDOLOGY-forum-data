[INDOLOGY] Digital of edition PTS Pali canon
Dear All,
Members of this list will have seen Reinhold Gruenendahl's regular 
updates concerning the availability of new texts on GRETIL. On behalf of 
the PTS I thought it might be worth drawing attention to the regular 
addition of texts of the PTS edition of the Pali canon.
In short, the Pali Text Society is pleased to announce the availability 
of digital editions of the PTS edition of the Pali canon. The files are 
being made available gradually, text by text, for free download on 
GRETIL (G?ttingen Register of Electronic Texts in Indian Languages):
http://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/
These files are based on the digital text input by the Dhammakaya 
Foundation, Thailand, 1989-1996 and are made available by the Pali Text 
Society for scholarly purposes only. In principle they represent a 
digital edition (without revision or correction) of the printed editions 
of the complete set of Pali canonical texts published by the PTS. While 
they have been subject to a process of checking, it should not be 
assumed that there is no divergence from the printed editions and it is 
strongly recommended that they are checked against the printed editions 
before quoting.
While the PTS edition of the canon can make no particular claim to 
authority or accuracy, its text is the one most widely used and quoted 
in the scholarly literature published over the last 125 years. These 
files should therefore be a useful scholarly resource. The files include 
the page numbers and line breaks of the printed edition.
