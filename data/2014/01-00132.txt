Dear Madhav,

just an addition to your remark: the term brahmaghos.a 
(brahmaghos.a-diman.galair) is given in the 
s'ivalin.gapratis.t.ha-vidhih. of the Somas'ambhupaddhati (Vo. 4, p.145, 
vers 188, Edition Brunner). The recitation of the four Vedas is 
described in verses 153-157 (p. 126), Brunner remarks that there is no 
difference made between the simultanous recitation of the Veda and vocal 
or instrumental music, all being part of man.galas'abda.

Best
