Subject: [INDOLOGY] 5th Coffee Break Conference (Rome, 22-24 May 2014)
Message-ID: <041AE4A4-527D-4E70-8E22-FDEACC66EC9B@gmail.com>

Dear friends and respected colleagues,

in case you are considering to visit Rome this Spring, here is an additional reason for doing it:

A Coffee Break Conference on Space, culture, language and politics in South Asia: common patterns and local distinctions
Rome, Institute of Oriental Studies, University "Sapienza", 22-24 May 2014

About the CBCs in general
The Coffee Break Conference (CBC) project is the result of a larger reflection on the common sensical statement that "the most interesting  parts of a conference are the coffee breaks". One yawns or falls asleep while most papers are read ? apart from a couple of them and one's own one. By contrast, one often takes part of challenging and fascinating debates while sipping at a cup of tea or coffee. Often, the same papers sound thought-provoking and insightful during the breaks, and extremely boring while they are actually read. Therefore, what a "coffee break conference" aims at is to leave behind the rigidity and formality of the official academic and scholarly meetings and to favour an open-minded exchange of ideas, suggestions, discussions and criticisms, within the spirit of a friendly dialogue held in an informal atmosphere.

About this conference in particular
Panels:
1. Towards branch-crossing isoglosses in Indo-European (organised by Artermij Keidan)
2. Theatrical and ritual boundaries in South Asia (organised by Elisa Ganser)
3. Untying the knot: Tracing local elements within cultural phenomena in South Asia (organised by Cristina Bignami and Elena Mucciarelli)
4. Final Round Table on Space, culture, language and politics in South Asia: common patterns and local distinctions (chaired by Elisa Freschi)

Further informations can be found here: http://asiatica.wikispaces.com/2014+CONFERENCE+IN+ROME

Theoretically the calls for papers are closed, but, given the openness and informality of the Coffee Break Conferences, interested speakers are still welcome. Just email the organisers of the panel or the general organisers (i.e., artemij.keidan at uniroma1.it and myself, elisa.freschi at oeaw.ac.at).

Best,

elisa freschi
