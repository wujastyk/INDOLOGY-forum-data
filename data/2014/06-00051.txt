dear Colleagues,
A post-doc here is working (in part) on the R?jatara?gin?. When I saw her
typing the text, I was more than a bit surprised, but in fact, despite my
apodictic statement to her that "there must be an etext," I couldn't find
one (and needless to say, she had already looked!). Is this text really not
available electronically?
best regards, Jonathan
