[INDOLOGY] does anyone have any reliable information about this?
I just noted the outline of the conversation. Around 2007 I was told by a
supposedly knowledgeable person in Delhi that the Gilgit mss and most of
the mss of the pratyabhij;naa philosophy had been copied and/or kept at the
Indira Gandhi Kala Kendra.
I have not yet got time/opportunity to start a planned examination. Tho
there is no such rule, for resident Indians appointment in these Museums
has to be secured by personal presence!  .
