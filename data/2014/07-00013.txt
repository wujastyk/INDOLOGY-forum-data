[INDOLOGY] Query
Dear Dr. Jha,
Sumpa Khanpo never travelled in India, though he voyaged extensively in China and Mongolia
(he was actually an Oirat Mongol, not a Tibetan), and was interested in geography and history
generally. His extensive autobiography has not so far been studied, but you will find a short
resume of his career in
Petech, Luciano. 1959. Preface to Lokesh Chandra. Ed. Dpag-bsam-ljon-bzan. New Delhi:
International Academy of Indian Culture.
I have written two articles dealing with him as well:
1989  ?The Purificatory Gem and its Cleansing: A Late Tibetan Polemical Discussion of Apocryphal Texts?. In History of Religions, 28/3, pp. 217-244.
2011 ?Just where on Jambudv?pa are we? New Geographical Knowledge and Old Cosmological Schemes in Eighteenth-century Tibet,? in Sheldon Pollock, ed., Forms of Knowledge in Early Modern Asia: Explorations in the Intellectual History of India and Tibet, 1500-1800. Durham NC: Duke University Press, pp. 336-364.
If you cannot locate them easily, I will be pleased to send you pdf-s.
with best regards,
Matthew
