[INDOLOGY] Font with Brahmi characters
Andrew Glass reminds me that Stefan Baums (also an INDOLOGY committee
member) was the primary author on the Brahmi proposal which led to the
inclusion of Brahmi in Unicode. I produced the original font which Michael
supplemented.
Thanks for the update, Andrew.
