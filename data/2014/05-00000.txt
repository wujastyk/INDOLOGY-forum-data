[INDOLOGY] CFP - Krishna and Govardhana Mountain
Dear colleagues,
I am gathering papers for a special issue of the Journal of Vaishnava Studies on the theme of Krishna and Govardhana Mountain. I extend my thanks in advance for forwarding the CFP to those whom you know working on this topic or who might take an interest in the theme. I am particularly keen on drawing in papers which treat the mountain's significance in:
  *   sectarian Vaishnava traditions
  *   renderings in kavya
  *   plastic and performing arts
  *   pilgrimage traditions
  *   ritual practices
  *   treatment in Vaishnava commentarial literature
Papers should be double spaced, roughly 6000-8000 words, inclusive of notes (endnotes please, not footnotes) and references. Please submit in either Word or PDF format, along with a one-paragraph autobio statement. The deadline to submit is October 1st 2014 to christopher.austin at dal.ca.
Thank you very much,
Chris
