 Dear all,



Bhaskaracharya, the eminent Indian astronomer and mathematician, will be
900 years old in this year 2014.   My esteemed friend Dr V. V. Bedekar,
Chairman, Vidya Prasarak Mandal, Thane (http://www.vpmthane.org/), has
planned yearlong activities to celebrates Bhaskaracharya?s 900th birth
anniversary.   Throughout the year, a number of workshops are planned in
the various educational institutions run by the Vidya Prasarak Mandal and
also in other institutions a number of workshops to acquaint the students
and teachers about Bhaskaracarya and his works, and also about other Indian
astronomers and mathematicians.   Dr. Sudhakar C Agarkar, Professor and
Dean, VPM's Academy of International Education and Research and a noted
educationist, has conducted so far 20 workshops on the *Lilavati *in
different parts of India.



In addition to these outreach activities, an International Conference is
planned on 19-21 September 2014 at Thane, near Mumbai.   Professor Michio
Yano of Kyoto-Sangyo University and I are helping Dr Bedekar in preparing
the academic programme of the Conference. Almost all the notable scholars
working on Sanskrit mathematics and astronomy have agreed to participate in
the conference.



Please visit the website of the conference at
http://www.vpmthane.org/bhaskara900/  and read, in particular, the details
of the workshops in the section ?Outreach Programme? and the abstracts of
the papers to be read at the Conference.



The logo of the conference *vibhudh?bhinanditapado  jayati
?r?-Bh?skar?c?rya? *is from the inscription set up by Bhaskaracharya?s
grandson Cangadeva, announcing the establishment of  an institution to
promote the study of his grandfather?s works.  With *vibhudha *meaning
?god? as well as ?scholar? and *pada *denoting ?foot? and also ?word?, the
logo yields several layers of meanings, a feature which would have pleased
Bhaskaracharya himself.



Warm greetings,
