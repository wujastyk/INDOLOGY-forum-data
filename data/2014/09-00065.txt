Many thanks to colleague Dipak Bhattacharya for this instruction.

As far as Windows is concerned the necessary accent-marks are available with the Symbol box of MSW 2010. One can create shortcuts too. For long vowels one has to insert the standing accents. The numerical indication of the kampasvara, if one desires to show that, has to be created.  But normally that is not necessary. One can just indicate the circumflex.
