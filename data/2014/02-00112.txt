> A friend sent me this distressing information: "Actually, in a survey of
?strong? leaders conducted among Delhi University students some years ago,
Hitler came out ahead of Gandhi."
However, I wonder how much Delhi students actually know about Hitler.

The NYT
??
ha
?d?
an interesting article on the present situation, though
??
??
??
not touch
?ing?
explicitly on students:

One possible cause for the students' attitude stirring your astonishment
might perhaps be sought in Gandhi's own
? ?
and indeed disturbing appreciati
?ve remarks?
of Hitler,
? judgments that may well continue to exercise an effect today?
?. Note that the following statements were all made during WW II:

?
?Letter to Rajkumari Amrit Kaur (Mai 1940): ?I do not consider Hitler to be
as bad as he is depicted.? (Robert Payne, The Life and Death of Mahatma
Gandhi. London 1969: 485).

?Hitler too is said to be self-sacrificing. He is violence incarnate. It is
said he is a vegetarian. I find it difficult to imagine how, if he is one,
he is able to countenance so much slaughter. Anyway, his is said to be a
life of self-sacrifice. He has no vices. He has not married. His character
is said to be clean. He is always alert.? Khadi Jagat, December 1941, and
January 1942 (= Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi, vol. 81, no 638: 383 f).

?Although I am pained at his deeds, I can have no hatred even for Adolf
Hitler.?
Sarvodaya, January 1942 (= CWMG 81, no 736: 479).

Gandhi's Christmas Letter to Hitler: ?Dear Friend, That I address you as a
friend is no formality. I own no foes.? Letter to Adolf Hitler, December
24, 1940 (= CWMG 79, no 520: 453).?


?On Hitler and Mussolini, both "gentlemen":
"I would like you to lay down the arms you have as being useless for saving
you
or humanity. You will invite Herr Hitler and Signor Mussolini to take what
they
want of the countries you call your possessions. Let them take possession
of your
beautiful island, with your many beautiful buildings. You will give all
these, but
neither your souls, nor your minds. If these gentlemen choose to occupy your
homes, you will vacate them. If they do not give you free passage out, you
will
allow yourself, man, woman and child, to be slaughtered, but you will
refuse to
owe allegiance to them?
?." Gandhi, To Every Briton. Harijan, 6-7-1940 (= CWMG 78, no 460: 387)?
