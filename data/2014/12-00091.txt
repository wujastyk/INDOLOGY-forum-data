[INDOLOGY] Question on Sanskrit Syntax
<sabh?m v? na prave??avyam (Manu 8.13)>
30 12 14
Dear Colleagues,
Perhaps the P??inian assessment of the case is not exactly what has been
observed here. According to the P??inian system the k?tya-category suffixes
may mean the action or the object (3.4.70). When action is meant by the
suffix in *prave??avyam* it does not affect the object of the active voice
which shall retain its second (dvit?y?) case-ending by 2.3.1 and 2.3.2.
This explains *sabh?m*. But when it means the object it becomes an
adjective it must have the number, gender etc of the object.
The above means that in the P??inian system the problem of M?dhav which
occurs with a finite verb and not with a k?tya-suffix is not solved by the
example from Manu. In the sentence cited by Madhav, which has a
passive-voice, the object is understood as *abhihita *(by 3.4.69) and
normally its case-ending should be the first one by 2.3.46.
I just put the P??inian point of view without any claim to its theoretical
correctness. The basic problems of the P??inian standpoint have been dealt
with by me in a recent publication on P??ini with statement of its
opponents' standpoints. But I have not yet got a copy of the book.
The problem of accord between the *k?tya-*ending word and its corresponding
noun has often to be faced in Sanskrit. Cf., *?akyam a?jalibhi? p?tu? v?t??
ketakagandhina?* R?m., Ki?kindh? 28.8. Here too *?akyam* is taken to mean
the action.
My best wishes for all for a happy 2015
