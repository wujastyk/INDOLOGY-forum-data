I have been reading the Mah?bh??ya-Prad?pa-Prak??a of Pravartakop?dhy?ya
edited by M. S. Narasimhacharya and published in 1986 from Pondichery.
There is no introduction to this volume, and no information about the
author.  I am wondering if anyone else has come across any information
about this author.
