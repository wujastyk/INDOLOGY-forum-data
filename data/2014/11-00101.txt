[INDOLOGY] "Happiness" and "well-being" in Sanskrit literature
Dear colleagues,
I have started to work on the notions of well-being and happiness. In psychology and more generally in social sciences, current
conceptions of well-being and happiness often draw a
distinction between ?eudaimonic? and ?hedonic? perspectives, with reference to Classical Hellenic philosophy, notably Aristotle?s concept of eudaimonia
or Aristippus? notion of hedone (see e.g. Ryan & Deci, 2001; Ryff, 1989; Waterman,
1993, 2013). 
I wonder whether (or to what extent) such
conceptual frameworks are valid outside the Western context. I also try to find out how well-being and
happiness been conceptualised differently elsewhere, especially in India, in Sanskrit texts.
I have not found many bibliographical references so far (mostly papers by psychologists such as Kiran Kumar Salagame or Mohsen Joshanloo, and papers on ku"sala by Redesco and Cousins).
I would thus be extremely grateful for any suggestions.
If any member of the list is also interested in this topic, I am also interested in possible collaborations. Please let me know!
Best wishes,
Pascale Haag.
