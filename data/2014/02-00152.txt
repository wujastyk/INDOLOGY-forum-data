[INDOLOGY] Brahmin?
Dear Jarrod,
You can answer those questions for yourself by checking Monier-Williams, 
where you will discover that Brahmin is indeed a bone fide Sanskrit term, at 
least as old as the ?ra?yakas.
See

for Braahma.n, this would follow the modern habit of dropping the final -a, 
since braahma.na is another term with a long history.
