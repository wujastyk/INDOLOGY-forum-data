Dear all,

As a life long academic (so far), I have endorse without reservation both
Robert's and Paolo's thoughtful and cogent statements.

Without the opposing side there is no dialogue and there is then a worse
danger of monolithic views becoming dogma which we have seen all too much
of is this world.

John

A modest Ironic note (criticizing Motilal is nothing more that a hot air in
the desert)

a typewriter ...
