Dear Readers and Lovers of Sanskrit,
This issue is being sent to you with great pleasure and with very  
special thanks to Professor George Cardona for his illuminatingly  
clear thoughts about proper and improper words and to Professor Saroja  
Bhate for her lovely story about an old women.
It is hoped that you too will thoroughly enjoy them.
On behalf of the IASS I take this opportunity to wish you all the best  
for the New Year.
Jayendra Soni
