[INDOLOGY] Alchemy metaphor
Thanks so much for your reply, Dominik. It is very helpful, since I have
been confused about the meaning of vedha/vedhana in these texts. I have
been translating it as piercing, since the context often is a transmission (
*sankramana*) of spiritual energy from guru to disciple, but it has not
been entirely satisfactory. Do you have a reference to its use in
rasa-??stra?  In the passage I cited, I don't think it's quite synonymous
with abhini+vi?, I think the latter is a further stage in the process,
because it goes with *tury?t?ta-da?? *while the *vidh *verb goes with
*tury?-da??*. So, infused then immersed?
To explain the passage briefly as I now understand it, when the layers of
subjectivity which are actually objects (e.g. body etc.) are
permeated/infused/penetrated (*vidhyate*) by the elixir of awakened
consciousness, they are transmuted and shine like gold, i.e. appear as
expressions of that consciousness rather than separate objects. Further
immersion (*abhinivi??a*) in this elixir of consciousness
digests/oxidizes/wears (*j?r?a*) away the gold, leaving only the liquid
essence itself, with no trace of objectivity. This seems to fit within the
larger scope of his argument and avoid doing violence to the alchemical
metaphor, which of course I don't completely understand.  any further
comments welcome.
