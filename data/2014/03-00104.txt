[INDOLOGY] Sanskrit Mss in St Petersburg (Rosane Rocher)
Dear Prof. Rocher,
I do not know if the catalogs listed in Janert's Annotated Bibliography 
of the Catalogues of Indian Manuscripts (nos. 150, 261-262 and 288-290) 
and in Biswas'Bibliographic Survey of Indian Manuscript Catalogues (nos. 
0827-0828 and 0945-0947) are comprehensive, but maybe the might be 
helpful (maybe also the article by The Central Asian Manuscript 
Collection of the St. Petersburg Branch of the Institute of Oriental 
Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences by M. I. Vorobyova 
Desyatovskaya and Jan Nattier).
Best wishes,
Camillo Formigatti
