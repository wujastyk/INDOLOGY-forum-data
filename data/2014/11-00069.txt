[INDOLOGY] Helping each other
Just a comment on Dominik's far-sighted remarks.
When I was a student at Harvard, one of the very best things about being
there was the amazing library;  I could find pretty much anything in there.
When i was at Columbia, the library was almost as good, except that
frequently key volumes were missing, since there were no locks on the
windows out onto the street and evidently over the years some wiley
students had tossed out books to their friends;  but with Interlibrary loan
I could fill the gaps.
The more texts that are uploaded to archive.org, the closer we (gradually)
move to a global electronic library with everything one needs for research.
Cheers
