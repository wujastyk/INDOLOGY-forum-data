Dear Herman,


ma?anta?aiyam < ma?anta + a?aiyam


Compare 
y?? ka??a?aiyar 		in 	Pu?. 191.4
c?r nacainta?aiy?y 	in	Ku?. 52.2


The meaning of etirko? is the opposite of what you have indicated. See Tamil Lexicon entry below.


?????????(??)-??? etir-ko?-
, v. tr. < ?????? +. [T. edurkonu.] 1. To advance or go towards a guest or great person to meet, welcome and receive him; ?????????. ?????? ????????????????? (?????. 36). 2. To accept; ????????????????. ????? ???????????? (??. ??. 9, 32).


The scenario you envisage will not apply here.



Regards,
Palaniappan

I had another look atKu?untokai 106, discussed earlier by Palaniappan and Hart:


?
t?ti ?e?cattuk kil?avi namvayi?
vanta??u v??i t??i n?mu
neypey t?yi? etirko??u
t?m(/t??/ta?) ma?anta?aiyam e?a vi?ukan t?t?.


As I see it, the real problem of the poem consists of the construction of two verbal participles, or absolutives,etirko??u and ma?antu, followed by a?aiyam ?we are like that?. The construction is rare but I found one other instance inNa??i?ai 179, lines 6-7 (v??kuva?al? vimmi nerunalum a?aiyal?) about a spoilt girl who refuses to drink the sweet milk her mother gave her, sobbing (vimmi, a verbal participle) and clamouring for more extravagant sweets (v??kuva?al?, a participial noun). Only yesterday the girl behaved like that (a?aiyal?) but just now she ran away with a unknown ? and poor ? fellow. No more sweet milk for her!
If this is how the construction works, the situation underlying ourKu?untokai poems may be described in the following way. The woman speaking had sulked, her lover had fled away and sent a messenger telling that he does not understand why she was angry at him. She replies that sulking is just part of the play: making love (ma?antu) after a quarrel (opposing the lover's avances, etirko??u, flaring up like fire into which ghee/oil is poured) is special. Compare Sattasa? 522 in the translation by Peter Khoroche and me (Poems of Life and Love in Ancient India. H?la's Sattasa?, p. 115): ?After every quarrel, it's true/The pleasures of love taste new.
