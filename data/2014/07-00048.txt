[INDOLOGY] Alchemy metaphor
The understanding of the passage that is being proposed is largely on the right track, especially with the contribution of Dominik.However, I should draw attention to two points that may lead to a different understanding of the chemical/alchemical process.
1. Literally, the translation of yena prameyatv?t tat cyavata iva should be 
	"whereby that (thing ??ny?di-deha-dh?tv-anta) slips down/falls away, as it were, from being an object of cognition" (i.e., it ceases to be -- no longer figures in -- cognition, although it is out there as before)," 
	not 
	"by which their objectivity falls away as it were". 
	Note that the subject of cyavate is tat,  a neuter gender word, and prameyatv?t is an ablative. ??ny?di-deha-dh?tv-anta is a bahu-vriihi and, therefore, something like 'thing', 'entity', 'assemblage' must be understood as its vi;se.sya. 
	Now, one can say that the earlier translation may be grammatically opaque but it essentially conveys the same thing as the translation I have offered. However, as you will see from the next point, the literal translation assists us in understanding the analogy rightly. 
2. In pr??a-deh?di-dh?tu? sa?vid-rasena abhinivi??o ?tyanta? kanaka-dh?tur iva j?r?a? kriyate, one would expect pure consciousness to be similar to pure gold. It would be inappropriate to compare it with what is left after gold is taken out. The process conveyed by j?r?a? should, therefore, be one in which impurities of gold are taken out as a result of its saturation by something (there is no word in the passage that would suggest that we should set aside the usual meanings of vidhyate, viddha and abhinivi.s.ta ranging from 'pierce' to 'permeate').
That that 'something' is paarada 'mercury' is what we learn from Rasa-ratna-samuccaya 5.11: ????? ???????? -- ????-????? ?????? ????????. 
Note that here gold is spoken of as the outcome, not anything else that goes with gold. 
The same Rasa-ratna-samuccaya, at 5.21-22, speaks of ??????? ????? ?????? ????-???? ?? ?????, which 'liquidity' notion is also found in the Abhinava-gupta passage under consideration. 
(I give the Rasa-ratna-samuccaya references according to the ?????????? ?????? ??????? ?????????? ???????, p. 1628, of ???????????????? ???? and ?????? ??? ????, ?????? : ?????????? ????? ??????? ??? ???????? ????, ????. I do not have access at the moment to the Rasa-ratna-samuccaya itself).
