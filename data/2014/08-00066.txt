[INDOLOGY] References on women scholars in ancient and	medieval	India
Dear Agathe,
Tharu, S. and Lalita, K. 1991. Women writing in India : 600 B.C. to the present.  New York : Feminist Press at the City University of New York.
Unfortunately, the sections on the ancient and medieval periods are rather limited and could be expanded with more recent research.
