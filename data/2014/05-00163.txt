[INDOLOGY] Sukumari Bhattacharji
Dear List,
I meant to send this message to the entire list yesterday.  Instead, I sent
it to one list member by mistake.
Dear friends,
I did not know Prof. Bhattacharji personally, but I very much admired her
work.  I mourn with you who were her friends and colleagues.
George
