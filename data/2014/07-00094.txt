For another critical comment of this incident by Romila Thapar, not an Indologist, but an eminent historian, see: http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/romila-thapar-smriti-irani-old-history-baiters-of-bjp/1/370799.html?fb_action_ids=1490229607886174&fb_action_types=og.recommends

[Indo-Eurasia] Interview with the new ICHR Chairman
Revealing interview with Yellapragada Sudershan Rao, Modi's new Chairman of the powerful Indian Council of Historical Research (ICHR), in today's _Outlook India_:
"Ramayana, Mahabharata Are True Accounts Of The Period...Not Myths"
http://tinyurl.com/qadhsft
Commentary in the same edition by Anuradha Raman:
"Ram, Where Art Thou"?
http://www.outlookindia.com/article/Ram-Where-Art-Thou/291362
Total public silence from Western Indologists so far on Rao's appointment, which is curious.
Typical quotation from the interview with Rao, a colleague of NS Rajaram, responding to questions from the interviewer:
You are the author of the Mahabharata project? What is the project about?
There is a certain view that the Mahabharata or the Ramayana are myths. I don?t see them as myths because they were written at a certain point of time in history. They are important sources of information in the way we write history. What we write today may become an important source of information for the fut?ure in the future. When analysed, of course, they could be declared to be true or false. History is not static. It belongs to the people, it?s made by the people. Similarly, the Ram?ayana is true for people...it?s in the collective memory of generations of Indians. We can?t say the Ramayana or the Mahabharata are myths. Myths are from a western perspective.
What does that mean?
For us, the Ramayana and the Mahabharata are true accounts of the periods in which they were written.
