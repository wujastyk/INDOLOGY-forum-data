[INDOLOGY] Display issues
Dear all,
I am new to this group.
I am attaching a sample of how the group message digests  are seen in my
inbox.
There are a lot of ????s everywhere.
Accent marks and devanagari text are completely changed to ?s.
I am using Windows 7 and Chrome as browser.
Can anyone help?
