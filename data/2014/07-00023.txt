[INDOLOGY] Corrections in Manuscripts
Respected scholar,
There is a very good book in Gujarati regarding the manuscriptology.
http://jainaelibrary.org/book.php?file=008464
Page 82 has some detail about the materials used for corrections in
manuscripts.
Similarly you can have a look at
http://jainaelibrary.org/book.php?file=003982
Here there are some sanskrit shlokas which show the method of preparation
of some of writing materials.
The materials which are used to strike off are known as "haritAla"
(sanskrit) and "safedo" (Gujarati - whitewash).
They are used to strike off letters.
The yellowish greenish tinge is most probably that of haritAla.
At the same time caution must be made regarding red (geru) colour. It is
usually used to highlight and not strike out the reading.
