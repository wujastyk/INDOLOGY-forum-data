Dear colleagues,

The INDOLOGY forum runs on software called Mailman.  It seems that a
potential pro?blem has recently arisen that affects Yahoo mail users.  See
the message below.

We are not acting on this information immediately, but please be alert for
yahoo-related problems, and inform the INDOLOGY committee <
indology-owner at list.indology.info> if you see a problem.

Best,
Dominik Wujastyk
INDOLOGY committee

Subject: Yahoo's Blunder Impacts Mailing Lists Worldwide

Dear Client:

Yahoo initiated a terrible policy change to their mail servers recently
that impacts every single mailing list software in use, not just Mailman.
If any Yahoo.com user posts to your list, they will cause those list
members whose ISP/ESP provider is using DMARC (Hotmail, Gmail, Bellsouth,
etc) to bounce the poster's message which can in turn cause the list to
remove these members from the list for excessive bounces. The problem is
with Yahoo. You can read more about it at:

http://www.pcworld.com/article/2141120/yahoo-email-antispoofing-policy-breaks-mailing-lists.html

https://wordtothewise.com/2014/04/brief-dmarc-primer/<http://www.pcworld.com/article/2141120/yahoo-email-antispoofing-policy-breaks-mailing-lists.html>

We recommend the following:

1. Resubscribing those list members that were recently removed.

2. Prevent any Yahoo.com subscriber from posting to your list until they
subscribe with another non-Yahoo email address. There is no telling when
Yahoo will fix this or if they ever will.

Again this issue only affect those lists where *Yahoo.com* users are
allowed to post to the list.
