Hello Mark,
Here are some starters. In my Myth as Argument: The Br?haddevata? as Canonical Commentary (Degruyter, 1996), I have a discussion on the genre of anukraman?i? as a commentarial strategy (pp. 30-35). The first chapter (pp.1-30) you might also find useful.
The final chapter (pp.441-464) discusses the role of the index and encyclopedia as a genre, both in India and more broadly. You should also look at (and probably have already) Tokunaga, "The Texts and Legends of the Br?haddevata?." PhD Dissertation, Harvard University, 1976, and A. A. MacDonnell's edition of the Ka?tya?yana Sarva?nukraman?i?, with Commentary of ?ad?guru?is?ya. (Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1886).
Hope this is useful.

[INDOLOGY] anukrama?ik?
Dear List Members,
Could someone please point me in the direction of discussions of anukrama?ik?, ?tables of content,? ?indexes,? in Vedic or later Sanskrit literature (their origin, nature, function, where they occur, etc.).
