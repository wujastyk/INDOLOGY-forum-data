[INDOLOGY] Brahmin?
Dear Jarrod,
Not sure whether you've looked this up yet, but according to the OED,
this spelling first appears specifically in relation to the Boston
brahmins (and there is the only spelling) in 1823:
1823   Byron Don Juan: Canto XIII lxxxiii. 96   Thirty-three Of
highest caste--the Brahmins of the ton.
In reference to members of the brahm(a/i)n caste, spelling varies
greatly, but spelling involving -i- is found quite early on. Again,
here's what the OED lists.
1481   Myrrour of Worlde (Caxton) ii. v. 70   Other peple whiche ben
callyd..bragman whiche ben fayrer than they to fore named.
1553   R. Eden tr. S. M?nster Treat. Newe India sig. Cvv,   Their
Priestes (called Bramini).
1599   R. Fitch in R. Hakluyt Princ. Navigations (new ed.) II. i. 252
 The Bramanes which are their priests.
1634   T. Herbert Relation Trav. 50   An ancient Braminy, a deuout Wretch.
1650   J. Bulwer Anthropometamorphosis iii. 66   The Bramines of Agra

1656   T. Blount Glossographia,   Brackmans, a sect of Philosophers in India.
1676   Dryden Aureng-Zebe iii. 37   Take the preaching Brachman hence.
1690   T. Burnet Theory of Earth iii. iii. 17   The modern Indian
philosophers, the reliques of the old bragmans.
1715   Pope Temple of Fame 14   And Brachmans deep in desart Woods rever'd.
1753   J. Hanway Hist. Acct. Brit. Trade Caspian Sea (1762) II. xv. i.
406 (note) ,   He was fond of the brachmins or indian priests.
1840   C. Thirlwall Hist. Greece VII. liv,   A whole community of
Brahmins may have preserved the purity of their blood.
1842   J. C. Prichard Nat. Hist. Man 163   Aryavarta was the Holy Land
of the Brahmans.
Hope this helps!
