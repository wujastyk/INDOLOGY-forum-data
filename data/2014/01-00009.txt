 *CALL FOR PAPERS: GREECE and INDIA.*
*Proposals are invited for 30-minute papers at a Conference on Indian and
Greek Thought, at the University of Exeter, July 9-12, 2014.*
This is part of the AHRC funded project  '?tman and Psyche. Cosmology and
the Self in Ancient India and Ancient Greece', conducted by Dr. Richard
Fynes of de Montfort University and Professor Richard Seaford of the
University of Exeter..
More information about the project appears at
http://atmanandpsyche.exeter.ac.uk/
The theme of the conference is the striking similarities (and reasons for
the similarities) in philosophical thought between India and Greece in the
period before Alexander crossed the Indus in 326 BCE. Papers that
concentrate mainly on one or other of the two cultures, or on a later
period, are not necessarily ineligible, provided that they are likely to
stimulate discussion of the main theme.
If you would like to be on the circulation list, please contact
R.A.S.Seaford at ex.ac.uk
If you would also like to give a paper, please send an abstract (300 words
maximum).
Funding may be available for the expenses of those giving papers.
