[INDOLOGY] 16 Wedding Adornments
It is deeply sad that most researchers look for evidences only in Sanskrit! That?s alright but not absolute. 
An enumeration of a woman?s ornaments ? yes, there is an enumeration in an earlier Tamil text called the Cilappatikaaram. If anyone would be interested, let me know and I?ll help them read through the text. 
Best,
Rajam
