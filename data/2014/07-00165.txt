[INDOLOGY] unpublished article by Jean Filliozat?
Dear Dominik,
Dear Colleagues,
Attached (I hope) the very file you mentioned: a 'tapuscrit' of Jean
Filliozat, signed by Arion Ro?u as unpublished (back then).
Some related material is extant in Arion Ro?u's archives in Paris and in
Bucharest (which I just checked). It goes without saying, Arion Ro?u
meticulously abstracted his revered master's teaching courses at the
College de France, his hundreds of handwritten pages during the 1970s being
a better proof of Filliozat's mastery of all things Indological than his
shorter articles from the Annuaire (freely available online). Please add
the ZDMG reference follows the discussion from his 1978 book (s.v. visha /
psychotropes). Hope it helps, even if the quality of my photo is rather
poor.
with all best wishes,
Eugen
