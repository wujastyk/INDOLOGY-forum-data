[INDOLOGY] language identification (Adam Bowles)
Dear Dr Bowles,
At least a part of the last quote is in Italian, but written with a 
funny English orthography:
?_Sat tu sicurah da non lasharay andarah, guescha bect-cha, liberal dubo 
toto suferanza.
Sei tu sicura di non lasciare andare questa vecchia, liberala da tutta 
[la] sofferenza
The translation 'Death to you; death by terrible torture' etc. doesn't 
correspond to the Italian, which means 'Are you sure you want to release 
this old woman, free her from [the] suffering' or something in this 
direction (the last part is a little bit strange).
I hope I've been able to help you!
