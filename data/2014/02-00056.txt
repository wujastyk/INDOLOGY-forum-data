Dear Dr Bowles,

At least a part of the last quote is in Italian, but written with a 
funny English orthography:

?_Sat tu sicurah da non lasharay andarah, guescha bect-cha, liberal dubo 
toto suferanza.

Sei tu sicura di non lasciare andare questa vecchia, liberala da tutta 
[la] sofferenza

The translation 'Death to you; death by terrible torture' etc. doesn't 
correspond to the Italian, which means 'Are you sure you want to release 
this old woman, free her from [the] suffering' or something in this 
direction (the last part is a little bit strange).

I hope I've been able to help you!

Camillo Formigatti
