[INDOLOGY] Hitler and MLBD
I speak for no one other than myself here, but:
1. I think this topic may be getting a bit off focus, which is/should be
the behavior of one of the major Indological publishers (I know I am not
the first to voice this).
And less importantly, but still worth saying:
2. There is nothing remotely 'alleged' about the Nazism of some of those in
Ukraine. They are on video as saying (I wish I were making this up) "We do
not agree with *everything* Hitler did," meaning unfortunately not that
they disagree with everything, but that there are some things they do not
agree with.....
Indeed there can be nazis everywhere, but we as Indologists do not have to
put up with this anywhere, and reacting to the unacceptable actions of an
organization against which we might have some weight seems a good use of
our collective authority. The fact, to me, that the owners are Jains I find
frankly to move this all nearly beyond comprehension.
