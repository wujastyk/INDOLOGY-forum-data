 Thanks to Tim Lubin. Yes. "ta" and "bha" are similar enough
 in some specimens of Sharada to be misread for each other.
 So, the point made by Prof. Slaje stands. 
 I have checked as many words ending in -garbha in Einoo's
 book as I could. Yes, they would support the emendation to
 -garbha.
 Helpful responses were also received from Tim Cahill and
 Bindu Bhatt. Thanks to them as well for clearing my doubts.
 I withdraw the suggestion to emend the text to -garga.
 Although that emendation would also have been
 transcriptionally probable at a certain stage, the support
 for it is not as many-sided as for -garbha.

 yields many examples, including a N?r?ya?agarbha.
