[INDOLOGY] Traditional/ insider's view of language or dialect status of Prakrits
1.What is interesting is that Sanskrit and Prakrit are treated as mutually
intelligible is a good starting point. But one could argue that in an
environment of bilingualism or multilingualism too , two different
languages can be mutually intelligible.
2. Filtering the value-terms such as correct , incorrect, refined
(samskrita), corrupt (apabhrashTa) etc., it can be seen that Sanskrit and
the Prakrits were considered always alternative *forms* of each other.
Whether Samskrita is considered to have been formed through the samskaraNa=
refinement of prAkrita or prAkrita is considered to have been formed
through the apabhrams'a = corrupted form of samskrita , the point is that
in both the perspectives samskrita and prAkrita are considered to have been
formed through the modification of either one from the other.
3. The classical drama's presentation of the two as the social class based
mutually intelligible versions of the same language too matches with the
above mentioned view under no.2.
Thanks to all the colleagues on the list for the references. I shall take
the help of all the books.
Thanks again.
