Dear and esteemed Professor Gombrich,
Your observation is perfectly true in secular context. But would you not
agree that a mystic visualizing is different from the secular visualizing
of a living being and that Professor Hegarty's question places the former
in context?
Best wishes and regards
Dipak Bhattacharya
