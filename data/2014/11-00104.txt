Subject: [INDOLOGY] Zoroastrianism and Indian religions
Message-ID: <7F0E6220-99FA-4C39-8D2C-24B25970CFE1@googlemail.com>

Dear Colleagues,

Can anyone point me to work that takes up possible connections (beyond a common Indo-European heritage) between Zoroastrianism and  Indic religions? I am especially interested in the period from the C5th BCE to the C5th CE.

Thanks and Best Wishes,
