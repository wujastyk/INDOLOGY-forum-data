[INDOLOGY] Zoroastrianism and Indian religions
Dear Colleagues,
Can anyone point me to work that takes up possible connections (beyond a common Indo-European heritage) between Zoroastrianism and  Indic religions? I am especially interested in the period from the C5th BCE to the C5th CE.
Thanks and Best Wishes,
