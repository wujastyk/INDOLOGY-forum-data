[INDOLOGY] Calukya/Caulukya, etc.
I?d be grateful for some elucidation on the following from list members 
knowledgeable about royal dynasties in medieval India, particularly the 
northwest:
In his Daivaj??la?k?ti (1336 CE), the author Teja?si?ha, apparently of 
Gujarat and belonging to a family of (former?) royal ministers 
(mantrin), extols the Pr?gv??a dynasty (va??a) in general and speaks 
particularly of a certain Vikrama, apparently standing in some sort of 
feudatory relationship to ?the glorious King ??ra?gadeva, whose fame had 
become the head-ornament of the kings born in the illustrious C?lukya 
dynasty? (sph?rjac-c?lukya-va??odbhava-n?pati-?irobh??a??-bh?ta-k?rte? 
?r?mac-ch?ra?gadev?hvaya-puru?apate??). My questions are:
1. I had understood the C?lukyas and Caulukyas to be two different 
dynasties, the C?lukyas being earlier and primarily ruling in the South, 
whereas the Caulukyas ruled in the northwest. Is there any way that 
?C?lukya? could be anything other than a scribal error here? (I have 
access only to a single MS of the text, but Pingree?s CESS [A3 89], 
based on a different MS, gives the same reading, without comment.)
2. Teja?si?ha doesn?t quite call ??ra?gadeva a C?lukya/Caulukya, but 
almost. I?m assuming that this is the Vaghela king ??ra?gadeva, which 
would fit the time frame. Are the Vaghelas typically (or at least 
sometimes) considered C?lukyas/Caulukyas?
3. Is the Vikrama associated with ??ra?gadeva known from any other sources?
As always, many thanks in advance for any help!
