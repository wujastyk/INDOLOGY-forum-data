[INDOLOGY] Shruti and non-literalism.
Dear Edwin,
concerning M?m??s?, the locus classicus is the devat?dhikara?a (PMS 9.1.9). There is an excellent article by F.X. Clooney about it (1988) and some thoughts on it can be read also here: https://www.academia.edu/6263852/Between_Theism_and_Atheism_a_journey_through_Visistadvaita_Vedanta_and_Mimamsa
A further interesting reading is Robert Goldman's "How Fast Do Monkeys Fly? How Long Do Demons Sleep?" (discussing literality in the interpretation of R?m?ya?a's stories) in *Rivista di Studi Sudasiatici* 2006. You can download the file here: http://www.fupress.net/index.php/rss/issue/view/231
best wishes,
elisa
