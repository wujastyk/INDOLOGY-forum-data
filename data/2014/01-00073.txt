[INDOLOGY] call for papers: workshop on Christianity in South	Asia
Apologies. I should have noted that all questions about this workshop
should be directed to SAchristianity.workshop at gmail.com. The organizers are
not on the Indology list and won't see questions sent to the list.
All the best,
Jo
