If I remember correctly, the last work in the list above 
(Da?ap?dyu??div?tti?) is edited by Mah?mahop?dhy?ya Yudhi??hira M?m??saka. 
This work gives two sets of numbers for each S?tra corresponding to the 
Da?ap?d? and Pa?cap?d? both. I have cross-checked the numbers with the 
Pa?cap?dyu??div?tti? of ?vetavanav?s? (1933 Univ of Madras) and they tally.
As shown in the footnote section of the attached image (highlighted in 
green), I usually cite both the Da?ap?d? and Pa?cap?d? S?tra numbers. The 
snapshot is page 290 of the upcoming second edition of 
Adhy?tmar?m?ya?e'p??in?yaprayog???? Vimar?a?.
