[INDOLOGY] Sunder
The word ?sundara? is common in Tamil literature, especially in bhakthi poetry. As far as I can see, the first occurrence of it is found in the epic Cilappatikaram, as ?sundara cunnam? [rendered properly as ?cuntara-c cu??am?] to refer to 'colorful fragrant powder' ('???????? ????????).
?iva in Madurai temple is known as ??l?la cuntarar? (or, "Alaala Sundarar?)
