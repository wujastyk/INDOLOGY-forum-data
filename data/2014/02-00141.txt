[INDOLOGY] Mr. Batra, NCERT and Penguin
Very true, so far as the List is concerned. But I am in India. I had that
in mind.
I am unequivocally against censorship when a book does not break the law of
the land.
I do not make stray comment on matters when the court is involved. But that
does not mean that I cannot challenge in the court.
