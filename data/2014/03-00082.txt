[INDOLOGY] Fwd:  the passing of Kamaleswar Bhattacharya
Prof. K. Bhattacharya was present at the Vedic Workshop held in Calicut/Kozhikode in last January.
He very kindly told me a few things about Paul-Emile Dumont (1879-1968) whom he once met (in Paris, 1963) and who was, like him, a long-living scholar as great as modest.
Best wishes,
Christophe Vielle
