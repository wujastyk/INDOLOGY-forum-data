Dear Ashok,
thank you for your critical remarks concerning my message. Let me briefly
address these points.
1) > I would be grateful for a specific reference to discussions of the
Sharada script that suggest such a possibility.
On page 56 of my booklet (with the original ak?aras reproduced from a
??rad? manuscript) you can check this possibility for yourself, the
difference being that a halfcircle below the m?tr? is open to the left
(rta) or closed (rbha). This applies of course to actual handwriting only,
but not to the abstracted shapes of ??rad? ak?aras, which is why I did not
categorize such forms under the heading of "Semi-homographe Ak?aras" (pp.
43 ff), where you therefore might have looked in vain.
2) > Srikanth Kaul' himself does not specify that he has emended the text
the way he has because "rbha" could be a miscopying of "rta".
I have quoted Kaul's editorial note verbatim, and he writes indeed:
" (*mislec[tion] for ??r. rt?*)". Kaul considered rbha a ??rad? mislection
for an original -rta and emended his text accordingly.
3) > Sriivara describes an unceremonious funeral, one in which a body
brought in a coffin and covered with a single sheet is simply dumped into a
space that exists in/on the ground, although it is the body of a royal
person
Actually, ?r?vara here solemnly describes a royal funeral in accordance
with Muslim rites. This is the context of the stanza quoted by me:
?asan, Sul??n Zayn's grandson and heir to his deceased father, buries his
father Sul??n ?aydar ??h (who unfortunately died of excessive alcoholism).
Regrettably, vocabulary and modes of expression of the largely ignored
post-Kalha?ian R?jatara?gi??s are nowhere recorded in our standard
dictionaries.
4) > In such a context, "bhuu-garta" conveying the idea of a 'ditch' or
'trench' seems more appropriate than "bhuu-garbha" (which would connote
greater depth).
