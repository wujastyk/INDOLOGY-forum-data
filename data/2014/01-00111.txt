[INDOLOGY] looking for Haudry article from EIE
Dear colleagues,
I wish to read
Haudry, J. "Notes sur les racines indo-europ?ennes *me-, *met-, *med-
"mesurer"" *?tudes indo-europ?ennes*, 11 (1992): 43-55.
but I can't locate a copy online or in any library near me.  I can order it
through the univ. library.  But before I do that, I just wanted to ask
whether anyone has the EIE journal at their elbow, or better, has this
article as a PDF already?
With thanks,
Dominik Wujastyk
