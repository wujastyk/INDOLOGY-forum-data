[INDOLOGY] Funeral for Kamaleshwar Bhattacharya.
22 3 14
Santiniketan
Dear Professor Sandahl,
Thank you for the information. It again roused all the memories of my
meetings and exchanges with the savant since 1979 when he had visited our
department at Santiniketan and made indelible impressions upon me
personally and through his exquisite productions. Unfortunately I cannot be
present at the funeral. I pay my respect to the departed one through you.
Please be kind enough to convey this message to the bereaved.
With greetings and desire of peace for all!
Yours
Dipak Bhattacharya
