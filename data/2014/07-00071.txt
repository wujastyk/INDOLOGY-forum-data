?The 1956 reworking by Priyadaranjan Ray of Prafulla Chandra R?y's 1902
volumes is an interesting "moment" in the history of Indian science in the
immediate post-colonial period.  It is not a reprint of R?y's original
books, but a re-framing.  It was published by the Indian Chemical Society,
and valorizes the idea that rasa??stra was proto-chemistry.  As such, it
plays down, and almost completely omits, the t?ntrika materials to which PC
R?y gave balanced weight.

Further, R?y's own *History of Hindu Chemistry* evolved a lot between the
first and the second editions.  After the first edition, R?y discovered a
manuscript in the Raghunatha Temple collection that he felt was centrally
important, and his second edition places that newly-discovered work at the
centre of his account of alchemical history in India.  R?y explicitly
modelled his volumes on the works of Marcellin Berthelot
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcellin_Berthelot>, whom he corresponded
with (and met, if I remember correctly). So he had a genuinely historical
interest in alchemy-as-it-was, which I think Priyadaranjan Ray did not.

Best,
Dominik
