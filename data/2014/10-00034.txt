  Dear colleagues,

  A few months ago, I sought help to obtain the following item:

  P.V.B. Karunatillaka, ?The Administrative Organization of the Nalanda Mahavihara from Sigillary Evidence?, The Sri Lanka Journal of the Humanities 6.1 & 2 (1980): ???-???.

  This request has not yet borne fruit. Could it be that anyone who reads this now has access to said journal?

  I would like to add another request:

  Rosen, Elizabeth & Alex Wayman, ?The Rise of Mahayana Buddhism and Inscriptional Evidence at Nagarjunakonda.? Indian Journal of Buddhist Studies 2.1 (1990): ???????.

  For neither of these two items do I know the relevant pages numbers.

  I would be very grateful for pdfs.

  Best wishes,

  Arlo Griffiths
