Dear colleagues,

Thanks to Stefan Baums and Reinhold Gr?nendahl, I now have the requested papers (and more). I will heed Dominik's advice and upload them to Archive.org tomorrow, then send the links to the list.

Best wishes,

Subject: [INDOLOGY] L?vi (1923, 1925)




Dear colleagues,

Would anyone be able to furnish a pdf of the original French version of the following:


  L?vi, Sylvain. 1929. ?Pre-Aryan and Pre-Dravidian in India.? In Pre-Aryan and Pre-Dravidian in India, by Sylvain L?vi, Jean Przyluski, and Jules Bloch, translated by Prabodh Chandra Bagchi, 61?126. Calcutta: University of Calcutta.
  

It should be available in Journal Asiatique, t. 203, 1923, pp. 1-57, but this volume does not appear to be available on Gallica.

If somebody could furnish "Ptolem?e, le Niddesa et la B?hatkath?", from ?tudes Asiatiques II, Paris 1925, pp. 1-55, I shall also be grateful.

Thank you.

Best wishes,

Arlo Griffiths
