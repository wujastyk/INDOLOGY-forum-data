[INDOLOGY] Request again
Dear list members,
Yesterday I send you a request for a pdf. of Prof. Dieter Schlingloff?s article Die Einhorn-Legende. Christiana Albertina, Kieler Universit?ts-Zeitschrift 11 (Neum?nster 1971) 61?64.
It seems no one has this article. However, Prof. Asko Parpola has kindly brought my attention tot he fact that there is an English translation on pages 294-307 of the following work:
German scholars on India: Contributions to Indian Studies, edited by the Cultural Department of the Embassy of the Federal Republic of Germany, New Delhi, I. Varanasi: The Chowkhamba Sanskrit Series Office, 1973.
Unfortunately, this work is not in the Royal Library in Copenhagen.
Perhaps, someone can help me with that?
