[INDOLOGY] Sukumari Bhattacharji
Dear Colleague,
Thank you for sharing this sad news and for your sketch of the life of 
Sukumari Bhattacharji.  She reached out to us when we were on a 
nine-month research stay in Calcutta in 1969--1970 and she was full of 
the impending publication of her /Indian Theogony/.  We visited with her 
on subsequent stays in Kolkata, one of which times caused us to ride the 
Metro for the first time.  In addition to being a dedicated scholar, she 
was a strong woman and a lady.
