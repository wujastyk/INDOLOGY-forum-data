Dear Alessandro,

As already pointed out by Prof. Slaje and Porf. Lubin, bha and ta (and 
in Sarada, rta and rbha) are easily confused in some South Asian scripts 
(to the Nandinagari and Sarada, I would add also almost any Nepalese 
script, for what is worth in your case). Since, as Prof. Aklujkar 
correctly points out, the texts you're editing are by Kashmirian 
authors, most likely they have been transmitted in Sarada script or a 
forerunner of this script, and such an error (garta for garbha) is 
easily explained from a graphical point of view. If you want to emend 
the text, I would choose to emend -garbha (another possibility, though a 
remote one in my opinion, is that the name might contain a Prakritic 
form, something not impossible, but far fetched).

Please keep us informed of what you find out about this pandit, I'm 
interested in this type of information.

Camillo Formigatti
