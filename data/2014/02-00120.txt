Even with the understanding that the devotional poems of the Vai??ava saints do not strictly follow the conventions of the Classical Tamil love poetry, the interpretation of Periya Tirumo?i 8.2.2 is perplexing. Here is the verse given in Periya Tirumo?i Ira???m Tokuti (with Periyav?cc?? Pi??ai's commentary translated into Tamil by Ti. V?. K?p?laiyar) produced by EFEO and published by Teyvac C?kki??r Caivacitt?ntap P??ac?lai, Ta?c?v?r, 2006, p. 962.


n?? nil? mu??attu ni??u iva? n?kki???;
k??um?, Ka??apuram! e??u k???i???;
p??a??r ti??am irukka, i?i, iva?
n??um?? na??u na??u Na?aiy?rarkk?!


The verse is supposed to be the utterance of a mother about her daughter in love with Vi??u. The traditional commentary (p. 965) explains 'p?????r' in the verse by relating it to the Classical Tamil Marutam genre in which the bard acts as a messenger from the husband to his wife , who is mad at him for having gone to the other woman. But then it goes on to explain that 'p??a??r' represents the religious teachers, who act to bring the souls toward 'God' and that in the verse the girl is resolute in her faith because of the religious teachers. And the mother concludes that the resolute girl will not be bashful in expressing her love toward Vi??u.  See attachment. 


I am not convinced by the commentary's explanation about the association with Marutam, the resoluteness of the bard, who is referred to in a very respectful way, and the lack of bashfulness of the girl. The respectful way the bard is mentioned suggests more of Mullai.  Won't a better interpretation be that the mother talks about her daughter, a maiden, who sends a message to her beloved through the bard; the bard comes back with the message that the hero will join her soon; emboldened by this certainty, the maiden has no bashfulness in expressing her love; and the mother is critical of the hero for causing this immodest behavior in her daughter? (Of course, many ti?ai conventions are violated here too.)


I would appreciate any comments on this verse and possible interpretations.


Thanks in advance
