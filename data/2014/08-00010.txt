[INDOLOGY] Font with Brahmi characters
Dear Will,
I had a go at the Noto Brahmi font, and basic support is
there, but not complete. (I had the same experience with the
Noto Kharoshthi font.) In the following sentence, for
instance
   ?????????????????????????????????????????????
(the beginning of Girnar Rock Edict 1 in Br?hm? script),
vowel signs and anusv?ra are correctly attached to base
consonants, but pa + vir?ma + ra is not correctly combined.
Still, it is good to see this sort of broad support for
Br?hm? and Kharo??h? emerging, and when the missing
rendering functionality is added, the Noto fonts should be
very useful.
All best,
Stefan
