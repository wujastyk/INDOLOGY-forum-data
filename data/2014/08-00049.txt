=?utf-8?Q?Re:_[INDOLOGY]_devan=C4=81gar=C4=AB_font?=
I'm running Mac 10.9.4
I also don't use Word unless I absolutely have to. Actually the problem
started, or was first noticed in Scrivener. It also exists in Text edit and
in Gmail, basically anywhere I would like to use these fonts. So it doesn't
seem to be limited to any particular program.
I tried steps a) -> d) plus restarting the computer and playing around with
the fonts in the font book but this did not fix the problem either.
I ran a test on other languages. Basically all the North Indian Fonts do
not work. ie Bangla, Oriya, Devanagari. So too Tamil, but Kannada works
fine.
Other language fonts like Bulgarian, Armenian, etc work without problems.
I think the next step is to go visit my hopefully friendly local Mac store
and see if they have a solution...replacement of laptop maybe :)
Best,
All the best,
