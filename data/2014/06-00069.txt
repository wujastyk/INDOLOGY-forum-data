[INDOLOGY] Schwa deletion in the medieval/early modern period?
Dear Colleague,
Although I have not read it, I recall that my former colleague whilst I was
at UCLA, Gyanam Mahajan, wrote her PhD on this topic. However, when I
looked in Proquest to track this down I could not easily find an exact
reference... Maybe it is best to contact her directly?
