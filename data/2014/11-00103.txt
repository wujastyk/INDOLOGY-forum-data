But I was correspondingly dismayed when my publisher prematurely capitulated in a patently winnable law case, and publicly cooperated with those who oppose free speech and promote a view of Indian history, culture and public life with which I profoundly disagree.

They wrote back (within five minutes) saying that they would let my book go, since they did not wish to hold on to an author who was unwilling to be published by them.  It has taken some time, but I have now signed the final papers severing my publication contract with Random House Penguin India.  All rights relating to the book have now reverted to me.  The negotiations were civil, even friendly.

That resulted in a new, revised, re-typeset and freshly indexed third edition that appeared in 2003.  As I understand it, that 2003 UK edition (with Dhanvantari on the cover) remains available.
