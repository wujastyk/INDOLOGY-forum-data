Dear Friends and Colleagues,
If you are contemplating on participating in the World Sanskrit  
Conference in Bangkok in June-July 2015, as we earnestly encourage  
others to do so too, then please note the following changes with  
immediate effect:

1. The date of the second Announcement has now been set for 15 July  
2014. Among many other details we hope to have special hotel rates by  
then, which we would like to include in it.

2. PLEASE NOTE this EARLIER date for the Submission of abstracts:  
abstract submission now closes on 15 OCTOBER 2014 (NOT 15 February  
2015). This earlier date is, for example, to help with properly  
organising the various sections with their numerous sessions on  
several days.

3. Early Registration Rates end on 15 January 2015 (unchanged).

Please do register as soon as you can. If you wish you may send your  
abstracts later, before the deadline of 15 October 2014.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.

You will find these and other details, including the online  
registration form here:

With best wishes,
J. Soni
Secretary General of the IASS and on behalf of the local organisers in Bangkok
