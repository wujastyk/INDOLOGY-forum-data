Thanks to Michael Hahn, Willem Boll?e, and Roland Steiner for responding 
to my query. You have all given me something to think about.

I am aware of the disputed translation history of the verses as given in 
Speyer (1908) and Laco?te (1908), but no consensus appears to have been 
arrived at since then. I am curious to find out whether Somadeva is 
hinting that he translated the work from the original Pai??c? and/or 
versified or rearranged its contents. While the former would only 
confirm what we already suspect, the latter might tell us something new 
about how he reworked the popular story material he was working with.

Best wishes,
Jacob
