[INDOLOGY] Sukumari Bhattacharji
Dear List,
My attempt to cut and paste the message failed [sorry: I am dealing with a
new laptop computer which doesn't do what I want it to do].
The message was:
Dear friends,
I did not know Prof. Bhattacharji personally, but I very much admired her
work.  I mourn with you who were her friends and colleagues
Best wishes,
George
