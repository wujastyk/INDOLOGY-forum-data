Friends~
I am writing about the luxuriant and opulent life styles of Hindu kings. I have an account of Colonel Todd about Raja Sansar Chand of Kangra. Does anyone have something written or a reference to the personal life style or courtly life style of Chola or Vijaynagar or any other dynastic kings?
Kind regards.
