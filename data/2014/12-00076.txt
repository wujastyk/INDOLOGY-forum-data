[INDOLOGY] Wayne Howard author of Veda Recitation in Varanasi
Dear Friends,
I am trying to contact Prof. Wayne Howard the author of Veda Recitation in
Varanasi (a magnificent study of the different traditions of sounding Vedic
chanting):
https://books.google.co.in/books?id=8fRRPQAACAAJ&dq=veda+recitation+in+varanasi&hl=en&sa=X&ei=rzmgVMXYB8eiuQSrh4CoAw&redir_esc=y
If anyone has current whereabouts and contact details I would appreciate
further.
I have tried via Indiana University but they have no contacts currently.
Kindest Regards,
Martin Gluckman
