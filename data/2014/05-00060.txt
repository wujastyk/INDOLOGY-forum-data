[INDOLOGY] Fwd: Hitler and MLBD
Dear list members,
An indological publisher claiming to  be a "leading Indian publishing house
on Sanskrit and Indology" and the first to win a Padma award for
outstanding community service through publishing (accorded to Shantilal
Jain in 1992), has a scientific reputation which it can choose to maintain
or throw away.
To decide to add an isolated non-indological book to the indological and
new age books published and marketed world-wide is a free choice and it
makes a free statement.
Especially if this isolated non-indological book happens to be Mein Kampf
(already widely available and widely read in India since 1928) -- rather
than giving the word to real heroes of the period such as Anne Frank (
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Diary_of_a_Young_Girl) or the non-violent
resistance group the White Rose (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Rose).
Although it contains many unverified points "(citation needed)", it may be
instructive to have a look at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mein_Kampf
and associated references to
http://jungle-world.com/artikel/2013/33/48296.html
http://rt.com/news/mein-kampf-sales-india/
Mein Kampf may be tucked away toward the bottom of p. 10 of MLBD Newsletter
vol. XXXVI No. 4 (April 2014), it appears most prominently on the Motilal
homepage where it cannot be missed: http://www.mlbd.com/.
