Subject: [INDOLOGY] visualisation of the Buddha
Message-ID: <8241F887-F1FE-452F-8BAB-D0E1BB54BA9A@mac.com>

I am baffled by Prof. Bhattacharya's remarks. I am completely able to visualise my wife in her absence. This does not  mean that I have more than one wife.

I would really urge people to read the Sutta-nip?ta text to which I gave the reference.
