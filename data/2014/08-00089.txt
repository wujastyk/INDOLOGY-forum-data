Subject: [INDOLOGY] The Longevity of Crows
Message-ID: <20140821161711.Horde.9UfyF4VUjSj4Lc8yDQ_adA1@home.staff.uni-marburg.de>

In the sixth book (entitled Nirv??aprakara?a; chapters 14-28/29) of
the Mok?op?ya/Yogav?si??ha the muni Vasi??ha tells his
disciple, prince R?ma, about a corvid (a raven or a crow; in the story the
bird is variously designated as v?yasa, k?lak?kola, k?ka, and k?kola)*
named Bhusu??a (this is the uniform spelling throughout the
Mok?op?ya manuscripts; in the Yogav?si??ha and
Laghuyogav?si??ha editions the name is printed as Bhu?u??a).

Once, Vasi??ha participated in a talk (kath?) about long-lived beings
(suciraj?vin) in which the raven/crow Bhusu??a was mentioned. Out of
curiosity, Vasi??ha set out for Bhusu??a?s habitation on a
marvelous tree standing on a peak of mount Meru. In the course of their
conversation we learn that Bhusu??a is the son of the male raven/crow
Ca??a (himself being the vehicle of the m?t? Alambus?) and of one
of the female geese (ha?s?) who are the vehicles of the m?t?
Br?hm?. Bhusu??a is virtually immortal; in the phase between the end
of a kalpa and the beginning of a new creation he survives in the state of
deep sleep (su?upt?vasth?). In few words, his method is the
concentrated observation of his breath which, in his case, is not a
suppression of but an intellectual reflection on his breath
(pr??acint?). Mentally, Bhusu??a is a j?vanmukta ("liberated while
living"). The story contains a lot of interesting details in literary and
philosophical respect which cannot be dealt with here.

By the way: some Sanskrit lexicographers list the terms ciraj?vin and
d?rgh?yus ("long-lived") as designations for corvids, and, in the
Pa?catantra and the Kath?sarits?gara, ciraj?vin is attested as the name
of a corvid.

* Cf. K.N. Dave, Birds in Sanskrit Literature, rev ed. 2005, p. 3: "[...]
lexicographers have treated all black Crows including the Raven as a
variety of a common type".
