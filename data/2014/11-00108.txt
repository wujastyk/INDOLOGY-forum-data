Subject: [INDOLOGY] Vacaspati Misra's words
Message-ID: <263AADEB1C61774CB059F93BD3A6940B14648F@MBX06.ad.oak.ox.ac.uk>

Dear List,

I will be grateful if anybody could easily remember the source of the following words of Vacaspati Misra. It must be in one of his supercommentaries but I was unable to pinpoint it.

'ekasm?tisam?rohi??? var??n?m asaty apy arth?vabodhe suj??natv?t.'
[it is because of the easy comprehension of the phonemes which get on a single memory, even if there is no comprehension of meaning (from them)].

Thank you.

Best Wishes,
Rohana
