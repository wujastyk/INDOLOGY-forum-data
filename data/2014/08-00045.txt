Dear List,
I am having trouble with the factory Hindi and Gujarati fonts on my Macbook
Pro. In the middle of typing they just reverted to the Latin font. The Urdu
font and phonetic fonts I also work with are fine.
I made sure that caps lock was not on.
I think it may be due the latest update?
I went through keyboard preferences and uninstalled/unclicked both
languages but that has not worked.
Has anyone experienced this problem before or currently?
All the best,
