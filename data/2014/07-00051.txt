[INDOLOGY] Alchemy metaphor
Dear Dr Aklujkar,
Cognisant as I am of your expertise, I must respectfully disagree. In the
context of the Pratyabhij?? philosophy being expounded by Abhinavagupta
here, the idea is that the body mind etc., which are clearly objects of
awareness, lose their separate objectivity in this *tury? *state, becoming
expressions of awareness itself (*tad? bodha-svar?p?k**?ta?**
tad-ras?nuviddham eva ??ny?di-deh?ntam avabh?ti*, further on in the passage),
not separate from it. So this is not the *tury? *of other schools (=
*sam?dhi*), because a complete withdrawal from the objects of cognition is
here called *tury?t?ta*. In the *tury? *state under discussion, it is
specifically the objectivity of the objects of consciousness that falls
away, not their appearance within consciousness -- but he specifies that
the impressions (*sa.msk?ra*) of objectivity remain.
With regard to your second point, the *Rasa-ratna-samuccaya *(5.11)
citation (thank you for that!) I think shows that *vedha *can indeed mean
transmute; so what we have in the Abhinavagupta passage is three stages in
the process (in which the agent is *ahambh?va *or *sv?tantryar?pa-bodha*).
The first is denoted by *vidh-,  *permeate, infuse, but also transmute; the
second, *abhini+vi?*, immerse completely (now deh?di have become like
gold); the third, *j?r?a*, in which all trace of objectivity (the
*sa.msk?ra*s referred to above) are "worn away" or the gold is "digested"
by the mercury in the metaphor. (This is now *tury?t?ta-da??*). Thus the
mercury preparation (*siddha-rasa*) changes the base metal to gold, then
with prolonged exposure eats away that pure gold itself, since Abhinava
wants no trace of objectivity left in this process. A nice (if surprising)
metaphor, since the idea of pure gold triggers our *r?ga*, and therefore
must be dissolved, leaving only the dynamism of consciousness itself.
Torella (1994) supports my reading in his summary paraphrase of this
passage:
"The objective realities with which the I had identified himself are
themselves transformed on contact with the I . . . so that they continue to
subsist, but as though they have ceased to be objects; they are compared to
copper which on contact with mercury is transformed into gold. The state
beyond the fourth state, in which . . . the differentiation is now
completely dissolved, the idant? dispelled; remaining within the terms of
the simile suggested by Abh., even the gold into which the various levels
of subjectivity have been transformed - from the body to the void - as it
is increasingly permeated by the mercury wears away and finally dissolves,
these realities only surviving in the residual form of samsk?ra."  but
later he seemingly changed his understanding of the passage, writing "This
experience, which corresponds to the
fourth state, can be extended further, until it flows into the state beyond
the fourth, where the components of limitation, including *sa.msk?ra*, are
totally dissolved and incorporated in the I."
This last confusion hinges on the interpretation of the phrase *sa
drutarasa iva ?bh?ti kevala? tat-sa?sk?ra?.*
I am taking *tat-sa.msk?ra *to refer to the sole impression of awakened
consciousness itself (*drutarasa = cidrasa*).
very best,
CW
