[INDOLOGY] help with periodical article
Dear Colleagues,
I have found an apparently reliable reference to the following article which I am unable to trace in any British library. I will be very grateful for any help in identifying it and even more for a PDF of it:
 S. Hariharan, "Some Sculptured Epic Panels in Gopurappatti", Damalica 2.3 (1973): 77-81.
The actual location is the Avan?
