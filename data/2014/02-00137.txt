Dear Palaniappan,
Here, one again, my interpretation (not a translation) of the poem::
"Word has reached us, saying that his (my lover's) heart is faultless (he loves us, did not misbehave). We will send a message back, saying that we are so too, once we have received him at the side of the (sacred) fire into which ghee is poured (i.e. once we have been officially married)".
We seem to be dealing with a marriage ceremony supervised by brahmins, and that has nothing to do with the question if ney is ghee or oil!

Sorry, somehow one word inadvertently got deleted in the sentence below.
It is interesting that I?amp?ra?ar, gives Ku?untokai 106 as an example for 't?tu mu?ivi?mai' meaning 'not disliking'/'not being angry at'.
It should read "It is interesting that I?amp?ra?ar, gives Ku?untokai 106 as an example for 't?tu mu?ivi?mai' meaning 'not disliking'/'not being angry at' the messenger."

Re: [INDOLOGY] Periya Tirumo?i 8.2.2
Indeed, I had forgotten about K?vya in South India. Thanks for reminder. I had read the book quite sometime ago.  Interestingly, when I read it I did not agree with its interpretation of Ku?untokai 106 at that time. I have checked it again and let me take this opportunity to explain my rationale.
We are basically trying to answer three questions.
1. Does 'ney' in the poem refer to ghee or oil?
2. Does pouring 'ney' into the fire represent brahmanic marriage ceremony?
3. Does 'pouring ney into the fire' mean the heroine is angry?
The quote from R?m?ya?a indeed suggests the source of misunderstanding. The quote from R?m?ya?a shows the usage in Sanskrit in north India possibly based on a Vedic ceremony for the equivalent of English 'adding fuel to the fire'. The descendant from that usage is what we seem to have in Hindi today as ?? ??? ?? ????? where the use of 'ghee' continues even today. But that usage is different from what is used in Tamil. While the north Indians use 'ghee', the Tamils use 'oil'  in the equivalent Tamil saying. A simple Google experiment will show this.
The word 'ney' could indicate oil, clarified butter, and even honey in Classical Tamil texts. The number of instances in which 'ney' has been used to refer to oil in Classical Tamil texts are too numerous to list here. In modern Tamil ??????? is the common word for oil and ???? is the common word for ghee. (However, occasionally even in modern film songs, you will find ???? used for 'oil'. (See http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvKOzk3wKLI#t=9s<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvKOzk3wKLI>))
If we google for '??????? ?????????? ???????', we get 24700 hits, where we are searching for (pouring) 'oil in fire'.

If we google for '??????? ?????? ???????', we get 3550 hits, where we are searching for (pouring) 'oil in fire', where an alternate word for fire has been used.

If we google for '??????? ?????? ????', we get only 5 hits, where we are searching for (pouring) 'ghee in fire'.
https://www.google.com/#q=%E2%80%9D%E0%AE%8E%E0%AE%B0%E0%AE%BF%E0%AE%AF%E0%AF%81%E0%AE%AE%E0%AF%8D+%E0%AE%A4%E0%AF%80%E0%AE%AF%E0%AE%BF%E0%AE%B2%E0%AF%8D+%E0%AE%A8%E0%AF%86%E0%AE%AF%E0%AF%8D%E2%80%9D
So when we have 'ney' being poured into fire, given the Tamil usage, 'ney' has to be interpreted as oil. Just because we have 'ney' (which has come to be interpreted as ghee in medieval times) and fire, some brahminic commentators (and those who follow them) seem to have reflexively interpreted the poem as referring to a wedding fire. Actually I see no basis in the poem to support that interpretation.
There is another instance where fire and 'ney' are involved. See Kalittokai 138.21-22, where we have the hero describing his condition (before the heroine returned his love) as being similar to that of 'eri paranta neyyu? me?uku', i.e., wax inside 'ney' over which fire has spread. This simile has been used from Classical Tamil times till today. (Ai?ku?un??u 32 uses 't? u?u me?uku'. Kampar?m?ya?am 5286 uses 'eriyi? i??a me?uku'.)  Here there is no suggestion of Vedic ceremony even though fire and 'ney' are involved. (We are fortunate to have 'ney' used here even though it is not really necessary. But it helps to solve our problem.)
In both cases, we have similes that involve oil. These similes are used by the Tamils even today just like north Indians use essentially the same simile involving ghee from the days of R?m?ya?a till today. But, the north Indians use 'ghee' and the Tamils use 'oil' in the expression equivalent to 'adding fuel to the fire.'
As for the suggestion that the heroine in Ku?untokai 106 is angry, that is not justified either. The simile is not restricted to a context of anger. As the example I gave from Kannadasan's work in the 20th century, it can be used to indicate a situation of desire too. It is interesting that I?amp?ra?ar, gives Ku?untokai 106 as an example for 't?tu mu?ivi?mai' meaning 'not disliking'/'not being angry at'.
As for translating 'ma?a-' as 'marry', in my opinion Ku?untokai 25 shows why Wilden's translation as 'unite' is justified.
In conclusion, 'ney' in Ku?untokai 106 is 'oil'. Pouring oil into fire does not indicate a wedding fire ritual. There is no dislike or anger on the part of the heroine.

Palaniappan

RE: [INDOLOGY] Periya Tirumo?i 8.2.2
An addendum: I forgot that I discussed Ku?untokai 106 also in my book ? that much maligned monster, which apparently nobody reads ? K?vya in South India. Old Tamil Ca?kam Poetry. Groningen 2001 (presently available through Brill), pp. 39-40. There, I also quoted R?maya?a 6.103.11:
pa?yatas t?? tu r?masya bh?ya? krodho'bhyavartata
prabh?t?jy?vasiktasya p?vakasyeva d?pyata?,
As R?ma looked at her, his anger increased further. He flared up lie a fire into which a great quantity of ghee has been poured.

As I have argued before (?The weaver bird in Old Tamil Ca?kam poetry: a critical essay on the method of translating classical Tamil poetry?. Studien zur Indologie und Iranistik 21, 1997: 293-319, esp. pp. 307-8,) fire into which ghee is poured flares up. If at all, it is an image of anger. See, for instance, P???yakulodaya 3. 59: pr?jyam ?jyam upayujya jr?mbhata? p?vakasya vidadhe pradak?i?am. In the Ku?untokai poem, however, we seem to be dealing with the fire circumambulated seven times by the couple at the wedding ceremony; read my article!

Onderwerp: [INDOLOGY] Periya Tirumo?i 8.2.2
I think the solution to the problem presented by Periya Tirumo?i 8.2.2 is given by Ku?untokai 106 by Kapilar. What I am giving below is the poem based on the critical edition by Eva Wilden but with gemination of consonants shown in pu?arcci.
pul v?? i??ik kal ivar ve? v?r
varai i?i aruviyi? t???um n??a?
t?tu il ne?cattuk ki?avi namvayin
vanta??u v??i t??i n?mum
ney pey t?yi? etirko??u
t?m ma?anta?aiyam e?a vi?ukam t?t?
The translation below is basically Eva Wilden's except that I have changed 'ghee' to 'oil' for ney.
Word has come to us, oh friend,
from the faultless heart of the man from a land where,
    like the waterfall descending the mountain,
appears the stone-climbing white root of the talbot fig
with low aerial roots,
   After receiving [his words] like fire into which oil is poured,
we too shall send a message saying
    'we are still those he united with.'
While ney can mean both oil and ghee, ney pey t? simply refers to a situation of 'adding fuel to the fire' as in the following passage from Arttamu??a Intumatam by Kannadasan, showing the common usage of oil being poured into a fire.
"???; ????? ???? ??????????????, ?????????????? ?????????.
???????? ????? ??????? ???????????? ??? ??? ??????????? ?????????.
??? ????? ??????? ???????????, ???? ???????????????? ??????? ?????????? ??????? ??????????????????."
The notes given by UVS to Ku?untokai 106 show that the commentator I?amp?ra?ar considers the poem to describe a pre-marital situation in which the heroine does not dislike/is not angry at the messenger from the hero. But Nacci??rkki?iyar, another commentator, thinks the poem deals with a situation after marriage. A comment by P?r?ciriyar, another commentator, that receiving 'like fire into which ney is poured', is not possible in a pre-marital situation. May be he associates ney being poured into the fire with the Vedic fire ritual. I do not consider that a likely scenario. In contrast, I?amp?ra?ar's discussion of the poem in Ka?aviyal makes more sense. Wilden is right in translating 'ma?a-' as 'unite' and not as 'marry' as some scholars have done. The waterfall and mountain clearly suggest Ku?i?ci as the landscape, as some scholars have considered. There is nothing in the poem that suggests that there is an 'other woman' in the picture. So I do not agree with T. V. Gopal Iyer's view that this poem belongs to Marutam.
Who is the messenger here? According to Tolk?ppiyam Poru?atik?ram, those who are allowed to speak in poems dealing with pre-marital love include p?rpp?? (brahmin/priest), p??ka? (companion), heroine's friend, heroine's foster mother, hero and heroine. Although the commentary for I?aiya??r Ka?aviyal 3 identifies the companion as a p?rpp??, Nacci??rkki?iyar (commentary for Ka?aviyal 10) only says that the companion is "perump??mai p?rpp???m", i.e., in majority of the instances the companion is a brahmin/priest.  Although poems like Ku?untokai 156 suggest the companion being a brahmin/priest, Na??i?ai 250 and Na??i?ai 370, in both of which, the hero invites the bard to laugh with him, suggest that the companion could have been a bard earlier. Moreover Nacci??rkki?iyar in his commentary on Tol. P. 193 refers to p??a? as p??ku pa??o?ukum p??a? and p??i?i as talaivim???up p??k?yo?ukum p??i?i even as Tol.P. 193 lists p??ka? separately from the bard and his female counterpart. Interestingly, in their commentaries to the s?tra beginning with "ava?a?i v???a", I?amp?ra?ar considers Na??i?ai 90 as spoken to the hero's companion. But Nacci??kki?iyar considers the same poem as spoken to the bard.
Thus whatever be the view of the later grammarians in classifying the companions as distinct from the bards and that only companions could speak in poems dealing with pre-marital love, the internal evidence from the poems suggest that the bards could have been companions too. If that were accepted then, they could have served as messengers not only after marriage but before marriage too.
If that were accepted, Periya Tirumo?i 8.2.2, makes eminent sense.  A maiden being in love with the hero (Vi??u), the bard (p??a??r interpreted as religious teacher) acting as a messenger, and the girl being resolute in passion towards Vi??u, all fit the pre-marital love scenario with no 'other woman' being present.  The lack of anger towards the messenger also explains the honorific form, p??a??r.
I would appreciate any comments on this solution.
Thanks in advance.
