Dear All,
I have been looking for an e-text of the Abhinavabh?rat?. I have failed to find any even after trying my hand at several possible places. Is there any part or chapter of this text available as an e-text? If there is, would someone be kind enough to share it with me. I would sincerely appreciate this.
Best wishes.
