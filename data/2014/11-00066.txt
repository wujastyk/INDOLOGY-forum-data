[INDOLOGY] Hathayogapradipika 1.38
This comes as a request from a student. Any help would be most appreciated:
My question concerns  the Ha?hyogaprad?pik? 1.38 which states:
The Siddhas know that as among yamas a moderate diet is the most important, and among niyamas, harmlessness (ahi?s?), so among all the ?sanas is the siddh?sana.
In 1.16 ? of what is presumably an appended part ? we are taught that ahi?s? pertains to the yamas; so why this obvious inconsistency? Is there any scriptural precedence to this case, where ahi?s? can be found within the niyamas?
