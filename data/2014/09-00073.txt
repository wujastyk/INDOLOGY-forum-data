[INDOLOGY] Short phrase in a Sinhala script manuscript
Looks like it reads:
diyava?ana magula
The first probably means "increasing water" and the second, macula, often refers to a wedding, but probably has here a meaning like ma?gala, an auspicious ceremony. The reference may be to a ceremony conducted possibly at a river.
