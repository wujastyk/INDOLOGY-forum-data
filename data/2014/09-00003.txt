[INDOLOGY] Narratology
1.9.14
German philology has the term Rahmen-erz?hlung literally 'Frame narration'.
I am speaking from unrecorded memory. It was discussed by some
acquaintances including me long ago. I do not remember the context and the
sequel. It neatly defines the Indian narration structure. This may be
probed into. There is no dearth of knowledgeable German friends who might
help.
