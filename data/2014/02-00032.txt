I simply searched: narayanagarbha. There were only a few hits. The earliest reference appears to be: Hariprasad Sastri, Palm-Leaf and Selected Paper Mss. Belonging to the Durbar Library, Nepal (Calcutta, 1905),. He mentions ek?yan?c?ryya n?r?y??agarbha? on page lxxvi and lxxvii of the preface. Alexis Sanderson mentions this same teacher in connection with the same manuscript on page 67 of Shingo Einoo, Genesis and Development of Tantrism (Tokyo, 2009).
It turns out that all of the hits refer to the one manuscript in Kathmandu. I?m not sure why Prof. Aklujkar was unable to get the same results in a Google search. I hope this paste from the search is readable:
