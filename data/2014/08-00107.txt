[INDOLOGY] Origin of the term "Indology"
Dear all,
if you take Google's ngram research tool (that takes the materials at Google Books as basis) and look for "indianisme", "indologie", "?tudes indiennes" with search options "Language=French", "Date Range=1800-2000" you get the following graph:
So, in the majority of sources the red line with "indianisme" prevails. Of course, Google's text recognition isn't perfect, and it may occur that the language is wrongly assigned. But it shows a trend, nevertheless. You may click at the date ranges at the bottom to view the links in Google Books where the search terms can be located.
All the best
