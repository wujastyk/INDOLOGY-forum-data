Again, in general, nothing can be copied without permission until 60 or 70
years after the death of the copyright holder.  Critical editions can be
copied 25 years after publication.
The above is probably right, but it's a tricky area.  To say the least!?
If you are a copyright-holder and you want to let others copy your work but
not to take undue advantage of your generosity, then you should consider
placing a Creative Commons <http://creativecommons.org> license on your
work.  This way, you keep the copyright, but you give permission to others
to reproduce your work under certain terms that prevent abuse.  This would
be good, for example, for an article that you would like your students to
be able to copy, or if you want to put a PDF of your work on your website
or on a service like Academia.edu.
Best,
