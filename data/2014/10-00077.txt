[INDOLOGY] Russian 14 cent. Birchbark MSS from Novgorod
Dear Dominik and Matthew,
yes, plenty of birch in Russia. And the letters are incised
in the bark. Here two photos where that is more clearly
visible:

It am not sure whether ink was rubbed into the incisions
(palm?leaf style), but this may have been unnecessary since
the incision made the darker lower bark visible through the
light outer layer.
All best,
Stefan
