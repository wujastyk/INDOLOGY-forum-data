*in the passage below, though not with full confidence. From everything we
have learned in this alchemical discussion (and following up the references
given), *drutarasa? *in the metaphor can only be the mercury, so here
*drutarasa?
*must analogically stand in for *cidrasa? *(or *prak??arasa?*), hence the
iva. As seen in real-life amalgamation, the *drutarasa?  *indeed *?bh?ti
kevalam *-- appears alone -- as a result of this process, having digested
the mercury. So Abh. is saying that *cidrasa? *is what remains, having
devoured *pr??a-deh?di-dh?tu? *(cf. *j?r?a *here with *grasa,
ala?grasa *elsewhere
in the literature).  That leaves us with the difficulty involving
*tatsa?sk?ra?.
*Since Abh. did not write *tatsa?sk?rasahita? *but easily could have done,
I propose that he might be using *sa?sk?ra *here in its other primary sense
since that is exactly what mercury does. But I withdraw my guess that
*tatsa?sk?ra?
*meant "the impression of awakened consciousness itself" which Dr Torella
rightly called unconvincing.
But I think it cannot be true that *tatsa?sk?ra? *here means "the
*sa?sk?ras* left by body, pr??a, etc. [for the moment still remain]" as
Prof. Torella suggested, because the *tury?t?ta *here being discussed is
being contrasted to a previous *tury?t?ta *(there being two versions of
this attainment), about which it was said: *??ny?di-sa?sk?ro 'pi asti, *which
is unambiguous. How can there be a contrast if the *sa?sk?ra*s remain in
this second *tury?t?ta *as well?  (Unless I'm missing some other point of
contrast.) I take the point that if one becomes *ek?bh?tam sa.mvid-ghanam*
then there is no sam?ve?a possible, but I'm not clear that Abhinava
disallows this possibility of going beyond sam?ve?a.
