Dear Colleague,
I express my deep sorrow. Will you kindly convey my condolence to Professor
Bhattacharya's wife and son. It bears recall that a few years ago Professor
Bhattacharya was extremely worried because of his wife's grave illness and
was glad to inform me of her recovery.
Best D.Bhattacharya
