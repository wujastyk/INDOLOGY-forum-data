[INDOLOGY] Public statement from Wendy Doniger
This is very interesting, Tim.  Thank you!
So the laws are aimed at punishing deliberately provocative offences that
are explicitly designed to promote communal or religious disharmony.  The
laws are not framed in a manner that depends on the assertion of a member
of a community that their feelings have been hurt or they have been
offended.
I would have thought that it would be trivially easy to demonstrate under
these laws that *The Hindus: An Alternative History* was not published as a
deliberate act of communal provocation.  Why did Penguin India feel
cornered?
