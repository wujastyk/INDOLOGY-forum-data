Dear? Mr Das,
I? already? read? the Sankarabhasya? on the Isavasyopanisad? and its English translation by swami Gambhirananda?? [Ramakrisna? Mission].My problem is? that what the? following mantra means :
Andham tamah? pravisanti ye? asambhutim upasate.
Tato? bhuya? iva? te tamoya u sambhutyam? ratah //ISA-12//
Swami ji? translates? the view? of Sankara and writes :
Those who worship the unmanifested(prakriti) enter into blinding? darkness;? but? those who are devoted to the manifested (hiranyagarbha)? enter into? greater darkness.
Here the problem? arises? :
1,what is the import of? the worship of asambhuti-avyakrita [ unmanifest]? prakriti ??and? sambhuti-???? karyabrahma[ hiranyagarbha ].Hiranyagarbha is mentioned in hiranygarbha Sukta? too where it means? a huge form?? of paramatma as? 
Hiranyagarbhah samavartataagre bhutasya jaatah patir eka aasit.
.In ?this way? hiranyagarbha? has two?? meanings. what??? import should be taken here as authentic?.
2.what is the system of said worships? of? avyakrita prakriti and? sambhuti ?
In haste I could not use diacritics.
