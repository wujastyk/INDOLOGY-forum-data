[INDOLOGY] test mail ...
Dear Rajam and Colleagues, 
On a number of webmail services, most significant of which is Gmail, this phenomenon occurs when posting to Indology, where one can?t see one?s own posts. As has been noted in the signup page for Indology (http://list.indology.info/mailman/listinfo/indology_list.indology.info, under ?special note for Gmail users?), it appears that you can "work around this issue by using Gmail?s ?label? and ?filter? tools to tag your outgoing and incoming Indology emails in the same way, so that they behave and look alike."
With best wishes,
Adheesh
