[INDOLOGY] Obituary of Professor S. Revathy
Dear Professor Taber,
Namaskar! It is from your remarks I could realise what more contribution
she would have made had she been with us, though I did attend classes of
other teachers (Professors Das, Padmanabhan, Drs Narasimhan, Gayethri
Peetha, Umamaheswari) and not hers, in my MA days as a
core-Philosophy-student at the MU--- the fact which is echoed below by one
of her old students Dr Gayethti Peetha Ganeshan.
The only thing I did for her (in 2003) I got her a copy of the
Tarkasangraha and Dipika elucidated by Gopinath Bhattacharya and published
from Calcutta. I can only realise her through her works left with us.
With best rgs,
Niranjan Saha, PhD Candidate, Study of the Religions, SOAS
Thank you niranjan for forwarding prof. Taber remarks. I would sit on the
edge of my chair to take down every word she said. The understanding should
be instantaneous within the class was her dictum. She belonged to the old
world of Indian teachers, true, honest, rigorous and kind. May her soul
rest in peace.
