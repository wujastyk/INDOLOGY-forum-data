?This point of Prof. Bhattacharya struck me immediately too.  Palm leaf is
more durable than paper, at least when treated (oiled) in the traditional
manner and stored reasonably well.  The worst writing material is
machine-made bleached paper?, that started to be used for some Indian MSS
in the early 19th century.  That deteriorates very quickly, and the
examples in libraries today are normally brown and crisp round the edges
and extremely brittle.  By contrast, some palm-leaf manuscripts 1000 years
old are almost as good as the day they were made (Wellcome MSS Indic ?.1,
?.2, for example).  Of course some palm-leaf MSS are in very poor shape
too.  But the older writing supports used in S. Asia were sometimes more
durable than later ones.  Birch bark is an exception.
