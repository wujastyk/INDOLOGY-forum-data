Dear All,
I will be very much thankful if someone could kindly either send me or direct me to a PDF copy of Yas?odhara's Jayaman?gala? commentary on the Ka?masu?tra. The English and German translations of the Ka?masu?tra, already available as PDFs, do contain the Jayaman?gala? too but I am after the Sanskrit original. We do have a hard copy of it (Devadatta S?a?stri?'s edition published in 1964) at Oxford but I wonder if anybody has got a handy scanned version of it, by any chance.
Thank you very much in advance.
Best Wishes,
Rohana
