Dear colleagues,
I have the pleasure to announce the creation of ISAS, L?instituto Internazionale di Studi Sud Asiatici  (International Institute of  South Asian Studies), a non-profit cultural association,  which will open in Rome, Italy this coming fall.
 ISAS? purpose is to encourage the development of knowledge, conservation and understanding of South Asia, with special emphasis on India.
