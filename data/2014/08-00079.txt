Subject: [INDOLOGY] References on women scholars in ancient and medieval
Message-ID: <CAJGj9eYeXdfY8E170+R+7Ssrhs=yPhuQM3SsCYXg4ikCfumfMw@mail.gmail.com>

1. In fact, a similar list can be obtained from various  other Indian
languages too. During modern period, historians of almost all the Indian
languages with a literary history focussed on the contribution of women
writers to their respective literatures. I shall share the Telugu part. For
example,

 http://www.vepachedu.org/Women.html

There is more.

2. There are some other aspects which miss attention in such surveys. it is
the list of women writers (composers) of folkish works such as Yakshaganas,
Devotional lyrics, philosophical/yogic lyrics etc. These women 'writers' ,
in fact are no less scholars. Most of these belong to 15th to 17th century
in Telugu.

3. Mention of women as scholars without their works as a matter of course
in different books is another aspect.
