[INDOLOGY] Illustrated Kamasutra
Dear Colleagues,
I have been asked by a colleague, without being able to provide a clear
answer, about the date of the earliest Kamasutra manuscripts with erotic
illustrations or simply erotic illustrations derived from the Kamasutra.
Has anybody ideas and, even better, references to share?
With very best wishes.
