[INDOLOGY] sea travel
In this regard, Akananuru 255, probably from the first to the third century CE, is worth looking at (my translation below).  George
255. P?lai
The heroine, who has changed (grown thin and pale) in separation, overwhelmed by despair, speaks to the friend.
Fearfully, his ship sways as it cleaves the water
and it seems the earth has turned upside down
on the great expanse of the ocean with its waves that smell of fish.
It is tossed by swift winds that never cease day or night,
and the helmsman steers, guided by the bright lamps	5
on the tops of mansions by broad bays with high shores heaped with sand.
My man has left me to find wealth, friend.
Could he come without delaying many days
and make the pain that kills me go away?
In our rich town where water dashes against the cool fields, 	10
the north wind blows incessantly, touching the innermost petals
of the rich flowers of cool paka??ai bushes,
their blossoms white against the dark karuvi?ai plants,
and making the green fruits of p?kal with skin like jackfruit
sway among all the k?ta?am vines with their fading leaves.	15
If only we could find someone kind enough to go
and tell him how the wind blows all night in our guarded, many-storied house,
and how my perfect ornaments grow loose, and how my beauty withers,
and the rows of bangles on my arms slide down.

8. ?Could he come? translates ma???l, a word that indicates her wish will probably not come to pass.
10. The land described is paddy land, whose fields have raised borders to keep water in them when the paddy grows.  Here, it would seem the water from outside the fields dashes on the raised borders.
13. ?White blossoms? and ?dark? are added for clarity.
15. ?Fading? is mutu, ?old.?
19. ?Slide down? translates ?rum, ?be unloosed.?
