[INDOLOGY] Aditya-varna
Dear Howard,
Thanks for your message. 
This thread seems to have got a bit tangled. James' question was whether 
AdityavarNa was common as an adjective; your answer was that Aditya isn't common 
as an adjective. That's a different question, but I think your answer is right. As MW 
implies, it's a vrddhi formation, and is therefore an adjective ("mfn" in MW's notation), 
meaning etymologically "belonging to or descended from Aditi", but it's mostly used in 
the masculine, meaning a class of gods or the sun(-god). Returning to Aditya-varNa, 
in the verse that appears in BhG 8.9 and in earlier contexts, it looks like a bahuvrihi, 
which is by nature an adjectival phrase (though like any adjectival formation in Skt it 
can be used as a noun).
With b est wishes,
Dermot
