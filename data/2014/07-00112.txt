[INDOLOGY] Interview with the new ICHR Chairman
I agree with you on the source of 19th and 20th century influences on Hindu propagandists and their theories of shastric historicity. Prior to this, faithful Vaishnavas, for example, did not have ?scientific? historiography on their radar as they do in modern times. Thus the notion that itihasa is indeed history developed in other ways in pre-modern times. 
I will cite merely one example, Madhva?s Mahabharata-tatparya-nirnaya (13c), in which he states (2.3-4) that the Mahabharata text available to him is rife with corruption ? interpolations, extrapolations, and transpositions of text. Yet he accepts the basic Mahabharata story as real history, in all its supernatural abundance.
Best,
Howard
