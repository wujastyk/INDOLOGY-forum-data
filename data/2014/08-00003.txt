[INDOLOGY] Font with Brahmi characters
The Brahmi glyphs are in the file "unifont_upper-7.0.03.ttf" (since they
are above the basic multilingual plane). You will need some input method
(or a character map) to produce the characters.
These glyphs seems to be included just for the sake of completeness, since
they're very pixellated and the combining characters don't work
(11038-11045).
