The mostly unending dialogs in wiki are quite puzzling (see for example the
talk-page ?hindouisme <http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discussion:Hindouisme>
?).

I have to recognize, having been for years insulted because I said i.e.
that it does *not* suffice to add an ?s? to build plural in Sanskrit or
because I dared to add the ?scientific? etymology of
guru<http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discussion:Guru_(ma%C3%AEtre_spirituel)#Etymologie>to
the nirukta etymology ?dispelling darkness?, I lost my temper and was
blocked, having ?implicitly?
insulted<https://fr.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Discussion_utilisateur:Zhuangzi&diff=100021558&oldid=100021531>the
guy, having presented an *Original
Research* (my words: ? La philosophie indienne est souvent d?cri?e dans les
milieux scientifiques comme trop bigote et je trouve important de montrer
que ces pr?jug?s ne sont pas fond?s et que les indiens ne sont pas d?nu?s
d?esprit critique ?  ?Indian philosophy is often slandered in scientific
world as too religious and I think it?s important to show that this
prejudice is ill-founded and not *every* Indian is devoid of critical
mind?) and having an ?expert editor? position (that?s bad and punishable!).

Elisa won?t be surprised that the guy was actually involved in
?neutralizing? the accusations against
Dieudonn?<http://fr.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dieudonn%C3%A9&diff=next&oldid=99709645>
.

I think that if we don?t act/write against obscurantism, the next decades
could become a bit difficult.

Sincerely yours,
