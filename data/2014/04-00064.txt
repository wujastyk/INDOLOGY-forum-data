Dear colleagues,

I have been trying to purchase for some time Ragun?tha-?arm?'s commented
edition of the 2nd K???a of the V?kya-pad?ya
(Sa?p?r??nanda-sa?sk?ta-vidy?laya) with no success. A friend came from
India last year with vol. I, and two parts of volume III, the others were
out of print, it seemed. I'm in urgent need to get his take on some parts
of the 2nd k???a though. Does anyone have a pdf version of it that could
send to me?

Best wishes
