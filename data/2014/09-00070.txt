[INDOLOGY] Contact of Prof. Dr. K Rajan in Puducherry
Dear List members,
Would anyone have the contact information of Prof. K Rajan of the History
Department at the University of Puducherry? Among other things, he is the
director of the excavations at Kodumanal. A phone/mobile number would be
even more appreciated.
You can respond to me off-list.
Thank you all in advance.
Best,
Borayin
