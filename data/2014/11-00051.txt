[INDOLOGY] Visuddhimagga
Dominik,
You are likely aware of Lanman's essay, India and the West with a Plea for
Team Work among Scholars (JAOS 40 [1920], and can be assessed here,
https://archive.org/details/jstor-593425). I don't recall any discussion of
the Visuddhimagga (I've not read it in a long time), but it does add to our
understanding of Lanman's views.
regrads,
Herman
