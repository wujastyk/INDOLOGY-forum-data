[INDOLOGY] 150th Birth Anniversary of Moriz Winternitz	(2013-2014)!
I would like to add my name to the list of admirers of Moritz 
Winternitz. In reviewing some years ago his Kleine Schriften (ed. H. 
Brinkhaus; JAOS 114 (1994): 117-8) I came to be aware of his enlightened 
attitudes (he was, for example, said to have been an early champion of 
the rights of women) as well as his amazing erudition. I hope that a 
suitable celebration can be arranged.
