The comment concerning Tasleema Nasreen - suggesting that those in the West stood by 
because she is an author of South Asian origin - is particularly untrue. Here are
some relevant comments from her biography in the Wikipedia:
"Leaving Bangladesh towards the end of 1994, Nasrin lived in exile in Western Europe and North America for ten years. Her Bangladeshi passport had been revoked; she was granted citizenship by the Swedish government and took refuge in Germany.[11] She even had to wait for six years (1994?1999) to get a visa to visit India..."
