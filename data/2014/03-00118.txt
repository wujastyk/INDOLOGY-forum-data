[INDOLOGY] Petition on Austria needs Science and Science needs Public Funding
I publicly support Dr. Eltschinger's request to support this petition.  I
have signed it myself, and I urge you to do so too if you wish to help
indology in Austria.
For those not *au courant* with Austrian matters, in January this year,
just three months ago, the Austrian government decided without warning to
discontinue the existence of the Ministry of Science and Research (=higher
education).  They moved some of its functions into the Ministry of Economic
Affairs, renamed Ministry of Science, Research and
Economics (Bundesministerium f?r Wissenschaft, Forschung und Wirtschaft).
 They split off those parts of the old Ministry concerned specifically with
applied and business-related research and development and gave them to the
Ministry of Transport, Technology and Innovation.
These moves became law on 1st March, just weeks ago.  These changes have
crystallized major uncertainties about the future of funding for academic
research in Austria, uncertainties that were already creating serious
anxieties in the main research councils last year.  In general, the academy
in Austria feels itself to be under serious economic threat at this time.
