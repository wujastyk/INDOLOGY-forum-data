[INDOLOGY] Hitler and MLBD
Dear All,
As a point of interest, do you know there used to be a small "Hitler Mandir" in Muzaffarnagar?  A few years ago it was removed to widen the road.
Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke's book on Savitri Devi, might also be of interest to those wondering about the Subash Chandra Bose Hitler flirtation. Pretty crazy stuff.
All Best,
Mary
