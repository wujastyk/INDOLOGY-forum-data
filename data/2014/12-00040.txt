Dear all,
Would anyone happen to have a pdf of Ivan Vandor's article on the ga??? wooden gong?  I am far from my home institution, which has only a bound copy of the needed journal.  Here are the details:
Vandor, Ivan. "The Gandi: Musical Instrument of Buddhist India Recently Identified in a Tibetan Monastery." The World of Music 17 (1975): 24-27
Much thanks,
Ryan
