A unique genre of literature, called Pillaittamiz (pi??ai-t-tami? ?????????????) exists in Tamil. ?pi??ai? means ?child.? In fact, the ?child? here is a god/goddess. Later texts (in the 20-th century) also include political leaders in this group (as a ?child?). There are many old texts on this genre, celebrating 10 successive phases in the growth of a child. These texts are highly structured, differing only in three sections depending upon the gender of the child being celebrated. 

For an introduction, you may refer to Paula Richman?s work ("Extraordinary Child: Poems from a South Indian Devotional Genre?).

For more details, feel free to contact me off-list and I?d be glad to share my knowledge.
