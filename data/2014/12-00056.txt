Subject: [INDOLOGY] Traditional/ insider's view of language or dialect	status of Prakrits
Message-ID: <CAJGj9eZRw4-KJYn+4J2sf66Zrqjzr=M1QtfR53HdQHzObg6z_Q@mail.gmail.com>

When did the convention of treating Prakrits as 'languages' and not as
dialects begin?

Was there such an attitude of 'languages' not 'dialects' towards Prakrits
in Sanskrit or Prakrit sources of the ancient or medieval period?

Is there a work dealing with this issue?

Thanks in advance for any references in this direction.
