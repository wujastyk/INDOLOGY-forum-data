Dear Dominik,
thank you, indeed, for providing a link to the premiere performance of the
last major work
by the late Sir John Tavener: a modern classical setting of  ??a?kara's
Saundaryalahar??.
Very interesting!
However, given this is a scholarly list, it may perhaps be necessary to be
slightly more
careful with reproducing ideologically biased ascriptions of authorship.
As well-known, the name of the Advaita philosopher ??a?kara? has
unfortunately
served as a hook for innumerable such ascriptions to hang on.
Needless to particularly emphasize, there is a long historical gap between
the times of the Advaita author and the origin of the ?r?Vidy? tradition to
which
the Saundaryalahar? pertains.
Best wishes,
Hartmut Buescher
