Posting for a colleague who is not a member of the list:

Dear colleagues,

The Doctoral Program in Buddhist Studies at the
Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit?t in Munich, Germany invites applications for
two PhD scholarships for dissertation projects related to Buddhism.

Deadline for applications: 15 September 2014
Start of scholarship: Spring semester 2015 or later
Duration of scholarship: 3 or 4 years
Scholarship amount: 1000 ? per month + insurance + support for rent + 460?
per year
Scholarship donor: German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)

The selection process comprises two stages: Applications are sent to the
Doctoral Program in Buddhist Studies in Munich. The program will select
promising candidates, who then have to submit their materials to the DAAD.
Subsequently, an election committee chosen by the DAAD decides upon the
successful candidates. It is expected that the successful candidates will
be chosen and informed by February or March 2015.

The prerequisites for application are non-German citizenship (foreign
applicants should not have lived in Germany for more than fifteen months at
the time of their application), a Master of Arts or Magister Artium degree
or equivalent, excellent knowledge of at least one Buddhist source
language, outstanding qualifications in the subject, and fluency in
English. A basic knowledge of German is also desirable, though not a
prerequisite, but willingness to learn German/improve German language
skills will be expected. It is desirable that, at the time of the
application, the last final examination has taken place no more than six
years ago.
