The following site presents an interesting viewpoint from a New Englander.

I am sure it has interesting resonances for Indologists :-)

The OED:

Forms: 			ME?16 bragman, 15 bramane, 16?18 brachman(e,  brachmin, 16 brackman,  braman,  bramen,  bramine,  braminy, 17?18 bramin, 17? brahmin, 18 brahman.


Etymology: 			 <  Sanskrit br?hmana,  <  brahman praise, worship; some of the older English forms were derived from or influenced by the Greek spelling ????????? (plural), Latin brachm?ni, brachm?nes, and medieval Latin corruptions; the form Brahmin, a corruption of the Indian vernacular pronunciation, is still all but universal in popular use; during the 19th cent. Orientalists adopted the more correct Brahman, which (often written Br?hman or Br?hman) is employed by most writers on India.
