[INDOLOGY] Narratology
Sorry to have sent this incomplete message.  My fingers are not as fast as
my thoughts.... gp
Briefly,
Indo-Europeanists interested not only in IE linguistics, but also in IE
poetics, also have spent much time on inherited narrative techniques in IE
narrative texts.  See Calvert Watkins, Rudiger Schmitt, et al.  They have
long known of the historical links between classical Indian narrative
techniques and related techniques in other IE traditions.
We find in the Bhagavad Gita, for example, heavy use of chiasmus [ a
pattern: abccba, etc], just as in the Homeric epics.
I could go on and on, but I need to get on
