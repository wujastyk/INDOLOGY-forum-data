Subject: [INDOLOGY] Pali question
Message-ID: <E5F571B94D36DB4AA048E0CF279CFC70511CD275@tabvmexdag1mb03.tufts.ad.tufts.edu>

I was using the CSCD Pali canon and noticed that in the Sutta Nipata, the fourth verse of the Upasivamanavapuccha has the line: ?ki?ca??a? nissito hitv? ma??a?. The PTS has, ?ki?ca??a? nissito hitva ma??a?;

Is  hitv? (long a) a legitimate variant that appears in the Burmese version or the Thai version, or is it a typo?
Thanks!
