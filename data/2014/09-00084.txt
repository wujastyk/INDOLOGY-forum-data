[INDOLOGY] text memorization
For Vedic recitational practices in general, and more specifically those of
the ?aunak?ya Atharvaveda, you can read the introduction to my book
"Recitational Permutations of the ?aunak?ya Atharvaveda", Harvard Oriental
Series, Vol 61.  I have also attached an article of mine that discusses
issues of orality and writing in the transmission of P??ini's grammar.
That may be useful as well.
