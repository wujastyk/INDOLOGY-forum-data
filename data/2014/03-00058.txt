[INDOLOGY] (no subject)
I do not know much about these things, but received a comment from a friend in India that "the Chinnamasta Devi does not have a lion for her vehicle.?
May I know the source of the picture on the cover, so I can write to him and clear his doubt? (He is not a member of this group.)
Thanks,
Rajam
