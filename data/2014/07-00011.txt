Dear Marco,

It is probably not easy to compare the practices found in all the MSS 
and all the editions of the NATP (n?l?yira tivviyap pirapantam).

As you know, the EFEO collection has hundreds of MSS
(how many NATP MSS does the Cambridge library have?)

Regarding the practice in the printed editions,
I made a random test, by examining the beginning of the Periya Tirumo?i.

The 1993 printing of the popular LIFCO edition which I have in Paris 
gives, on page 360, after the 1st group of 10 stanzas, numbered from 948 
to 957 in the LIFCO edition:

???????: ???????? ??? ????? ?????? ??????
????????? ??? ????????? ????? ????? - ????

[a?ivaravu: v??i??? ?vi c?mam ve??i ka?va?
empir?? il ka??il?? kulam ma?cu - v?li]

Those from "v??i???" to "ma?cu" are the first words inside those 10 
stanzas, and they are followed by the first word of the next group of 
ten, which is "v?li".


A 1937 edition of the NATP gives, in the corresponding place, a slightly 
different list, where items 2, 5 and 7 fit more closely with the wording 
of the stanzas:

???????: ???????? ????? ????? ?????? ????????
????????? ?????????? ????????? ????? ????? - ????

[a?ivaravu: v??i??? *?viy?* c?mam ve??i *ka?va???*
empir?? *i?pi?appu* ka??il?? kulam ma?cu - v?li]

The 1863 edition of the Periya Tirumo?i does NOT provide the a?ivaravu


I checked one of the EFEO MSS (EO-0554)
and we can read, on the corresponding place what follows:

???????????????????????????????????????????????????
[I do not provide a transliteration because the orthography is not the 
MODERN one ;-)

As you see there is a lot a variation but we do not seem to have a 
metrical presentation form of the a?ivaravu.

I would be interested to hear about metrical presentation forms of the 
a?ivaravu for the NATP, if they exist (there might be a special 
treatment for that section of the NATP which was composed by  Namm??v?r).

HOWEVER, the other case which I mentionned yesterday, the YK 
(Y?pparu?kalak k?rikai) is completely different.

In the PDF which I managed to send yesterday, you can see, if you 
examine the page closely that:
-- UVS says there is variation: "??????????? ?????????? ???????? ??????????? 
??????????????????" [muta?i?aippai u?arttum ceyyu? piratit??um 
v??upa??irukki?atu]
-- He provides examples in 3 different meters (see yesterday's PDF)

One of the remaining questions (for me) is of course to get an 
explanation concerning the Sanskrit technical expression "n?taka ?loka"
which is probably what is referred to inside the sentence I quoted 
yesterday, from the YK commentary:

????????????????? ?????? ??????? ???????
????? ???????? ????????? ??????????????
[urup?vat?ratti?ku n?takac cul?kam? p?lavum
mutal ni?aippu u?arttiya ilakkiyattat?y]

Was the R?p?vat?ra transmitted accompanied by special items called 
n?taka ?loka-s.

I would like to know.

I wish you all the best

-- Jean-Luc (Paris)
