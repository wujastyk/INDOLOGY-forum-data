[INDOLOGY] Source of "nAdevo devam arcayet"
The statement nArudro [= nAshivaH, nAdevo] rudram arcayet / contains the 
fundamental Agamic/tantric view that one has to visualise oneself as 
[and thereby become] the God one worships and then proceed to the ritual 
of worship. This is the underlying theme  of all Agamic/tantraic worship 
which is NOT found in the Vedic/puranic tradition.
