>From our wonderful student Martin Gluckman of the Vadic Society in Auroville:


--


We?ve completed the next small work to make the Vedic Grammar for Students available as an online reference, you can enjoy it here:

http://vedicgrammar.vedicsociety.org.in/

We?ve also made a link where you can compare classical to Vedic on one screen:

http://sanskritdictionary.com/comparative-grammar/

It?s quite useful as mostly the paragraphs correspond in the two grammars so you can easily infer the differences.

...

Kindest Wishes,

Martin
