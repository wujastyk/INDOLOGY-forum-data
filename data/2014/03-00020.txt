[INDOLOGY] 16 Wedding Adornments
Dear Indology List,
Joanna Kirkpatrick saw my request for aid on another listserve and was kind
enough to direct me here.
My efforts have been to trace a historical precedent for the phrase "solah
shringar" that I see used in contemporary popular representations of Hindu
women's adornment: magazines; wedding guidebooks; Internet. My greater
effort is to show how Hindu wedding adornment in the U.S. uses wedding
adornment as cultural capital and borrows from older adornment vernaculars. I'm
looking for resources in English, Hindi, and Sanskrit as those are the
languages I work in. In Hindi, I've seen solah ???g?r and various
transliterations in English. I haven't come across a similar concept in
Sanskrit, which would be phrased as some form of ?o?a?a ???g?ra.
Are there enumerations of women's adornments, sixteen or otherwise, found
in Sanskrit text? Your insight is much appreciated.
Many thanks,
Aimee Hamilton
