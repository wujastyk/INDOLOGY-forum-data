[INDOLOGY] Hess' "SIDDHARTHA" in Sanskrit
Dear Soni,
The email addresses on the INDOLOGY list (the only one I can speak for) are
definitely not public.  Users can't download the membership list.  (Or
shouldn't be able to: please tell me if you find it possible to do so.)
But of course you are perfectly welcome to forward messages about new
scholarship to the INDOLOGY list membership. That's what the list is for.
And Siddhartha in Sanskrit is fun, of course, and interesting to the
membership.
The problem is, that your message quoted another message that indeed asked
for mass email addresses.  "We wish to send a copy of this translation to
Sanskrit scholars and Universities in Europe/America. Would you please
provide us the names and email address of scholars and universities who
might be interested in having the translation?"  Although you know better,
obviously, there's no telling what third party might pick up this request
and start harvesting INDOLOGY addresses for the Muni.  I completely realize
that nobody is being deliberately naughty here, but some people are
incredibly protective of their email addresses, and would resign en mass
from any forum that was perceived to be facilitating unsolicited mass
mailings.  I'm trying to be protective on behalf of the INDOLOGY membership.
Best,
Dominik
