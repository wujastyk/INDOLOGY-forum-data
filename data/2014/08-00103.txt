[INDOLOGY] Origin of the term "Indology"
Cher Jean-Luc,
Merci, merci, merci!  (I had to override my computer?s rewrite of merci as mercy, which would have yielded a different, but interesting reading)
There is also everybody?s favorite source of information http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Institute_of_Pondicherry.  Note also http://facdeslangues.univ-lyon3.fr/presentation/departements/indologie/ (d?partement d?Indologie, Lyon). 
Looks like the power of the Acad?mie Fran?aise to regulate lexical choices is not infinite.
Cheers,
Hans Henrich
