[INDOLOGY] Available Works on Bhaskara's Brahmasutrabhashya
Dear Elisa,
Thank you so much for sending the link to the Takahiro Kato's PhD thesis,
which I've visited and downloaded. Actually, one of my teachers is working
on it and wanted some available literature on Bhaskara's Brahmasutrabhashya.
Sincerely,
Niranjan
