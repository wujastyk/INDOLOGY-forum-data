Subject: [INDOLOGY] Vedas: Divisions, Dating and Language
Message-ID: <53718FED.3080805@yorku.ca>

Dear Indology List members,

I appreciate that this may seem a basic question. It's so basic, I don't 
have any fantastic references!

I was hoping for references to authoritative accounts of the division of 
the Vedas into versions (Rg, Yajur etc.,), parts (Mantra, Brahmana 
etc.)  and dates in English.

I was also interested in linguistic accounts of the Vedas that might 
distinguish the earlier and later Vedas on linguistic lines.

All help is most appreciated!

Gratefully yours,
Shyam
