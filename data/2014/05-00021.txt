[INDOLOGY] Vedas: Divisions, Dating and Language
Dear Indology List members,
I appreciate that this may seem a basic question. It's so basic, I don't 
have any fantastic references!
I was hoping for references to authoritative accounts of the division of 
the Vedas into versions (Rg, Yajur etc.,), parts (Mantra, Brahmana 
etc.)  and dates in English.
I was also interested in linguistic accounts of the Vedas that might 
distinguish the earlier and later Vedas on linguistic lines.
All help is most appreciated!
Gratefully yours,
Shyam
