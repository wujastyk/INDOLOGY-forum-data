If the plan started in 1997, then this would explain the presence of
scholars like *e.g.* Alex Wayman (d. 2004).
A more recent discussion of L?vi-Bagchi links regarding a 'Greater India'
is Susan Bayly, Sylvain L?vi and the Greater India Society', in Lyne
Bansat-Boudon, Roland Lardinois (dir.), Isabelle Rati? (coll.), *Sylvain
L?vi (1863-1935): ?tudes indiennes, histoire sociale*, Turnhout: Brepols,
2007, with a review in *Bulletin d'?tudes Indiennes* 28-29 (2010-2011)
[2013], pp. 408-418.
