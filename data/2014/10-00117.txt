[INDOLOGY] The place of Indology in the Academy
Dominik, Madhav, and all:
My own experience being a Chair for longer than I care to remember is that there is no one "optimum" institutional setting or home for "Indology", by which we mean, I think, the study of classical/ancient India. It is easy to come up with abstract optimum settings, but they are of little value unless local conditions are taken into account. As we know, all "classical" studies are under institutional and budgetary threat -- note the elimination of classical archeology etc. even in Britain. My experience is "being small means being under threat". So, it is safer to have a broader and larger home in which factors such as student enrollments can be better managed to satisfy the number crunchers. In the US, in general Indological areas are represented in several larger settings: South Asian Studies, Asian Studies (thus including East Asia), and Religious Studies. Individual Indological faculty members may be located in other departments: Classics (Brown), History, Linguistics, etc. I think the most advantageous setting is Departments of South Asian OR Asian Studies, mainly because all areas of Indology can be represented there -- from Philology, Grammar, and Literature to Mathematics, Philosophy, and Medicine. Religion Departments offer only a narrow spectrum, but because they are many in the US they do offer the best employment opportunities to our students!!
