[INDOLOGY] Maurya etymology
In a message sent to me Dipak Bhattacharya points out that the
"Buddhist sources give the name as Moriya -- the 'peacock men'. Maurya from
Mur? is perhaps an instance of Sanskritization."
But - is this the only etymology?
Where Mur? comes from - and what would it mean?
Best,
Artur K.
