[INDOLOGY] Fwd: Hitler and MLBD
Dear list members
I dont understand the hues and cries in this list which is mainly a forum
for indology on availability of hitlars book on MLBD.
Off course I am neither against your decision to cut ties with MLBD  (it is
your decision anyway) nor a fan of hitler.
hitler has nothing to do in india. there are more national heroes in india
to follow.
this book is available virtuallly in every nook and corner of the world,
freely on WWW http://www.angelfire.com/folk/bigbaldbob88/MeinKampf.pdf,
http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/mein-kampf-official-nazi-translation-adolf-hitler/1016335572?ean=9780977476091
and
even on amzon
http://www.amazon.com/Mein-Kampf-Deutsch-Sprache-ungek%C3%BCrzte/dp/1480191353
all these editions must be pirated one as it is still in copyright.
what is the crime of MLBD if it publishes it for scholarly use just like it
is sold on many booksellers cited above.
more over MLBD is free institute to publish anything they want. there is no
need of justification. this book is not banned even in Germany  according
to http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17837325  Mein Kampf: Bavaria plans
first German publication since WWII.
"The book is not banned by law in Germany, but Bavaria has used ownership
of the copyright to prevent publication of German editions since 1945."
