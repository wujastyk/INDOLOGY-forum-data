[INDOLOGY] A query on Sunya Purana
Respected Colleagues ,
I am trying to find out a copy of Sunya Purnana .It was originally written in 10th-11th century Bengal. Later it witnessed a substantial interpolation in the   14th -15th century . If any of you has a scanned or PDF copy of both versions , kindly forward them to me.
