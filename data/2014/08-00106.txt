[INDOLOGY] Origin of the term "Indology"
David Smith has asked that I post the following on his behalf:
A quick look at gallica.bn.fr shows that in the Mercure de France, 15 May 1925, P. Masson-Oursel, in a section headed "Indianisme", notes in a footnote to p. 250 that the death of F. Lac?te is "une perte cruelle pour l'indologie".
