I believe that a recod of sorts may be held by Alexander Csoma de Koros's edition of the
MahAvyutpatti, which was submitted for publication (by the Asiatic Society, Calcutta)
 in about 1830 and finally released in
three fascicles in 1910, 1916 and 1944, by which time it had long been superseded, of
course, by Sakaki's edition.
