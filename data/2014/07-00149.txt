Subject: [INDOLOGY] MSS libraries: Jaipur & Ujjain
Message-ID: <B5956DF4-3323-4CD7-A04C-301C67202EB6@googlemail.com>

Dear members of the list, 

I would be very thankful, if anyone of you could help me to establish contact with the MSS libraries in Jaipur (mainly the one in the City Palace, but also, if there is one, in the Amber Fort) and in Ujjain (in the Scindia Oriental Institute). I would be, furthermore, most obliged for any additional infos (or "tips and tricks") on these collections' policies concerning copying/ photographing the MSS.

best wishes, 
Andrey
