[INDOLOGY] Vedic recitation technical term
Dear Colleagues
MIght someone be able to help out with the following?
In current Vedic recitation practice in India, one method used in either
pair or group recitation is for each member of the pair/each half of the
group to recite one line of the text, with the second member of the
pair/second half of the group reciting the next line, and continuing in
this alternating manner.
I'm trying to recall the technical term for this type of recitation
practice.
Naturally any references to it in the published literature would also be
welcome.
Cheers
