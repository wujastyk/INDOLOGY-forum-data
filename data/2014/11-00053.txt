I read here again (241 ff.) that Lanman was preparing an Elementary Grammar
of a mere 50 pages or so (but with a commentarial appendix).  I find no
record of it in print.  Did it never come out?  Is it lying in a Harvard
library?

PS I enjoyed his charmingly-expressed swipe at Stenzler (242). :-)
And in footnote 11 he perfectly foretells chatspeak: "Don't be disconsol8."
