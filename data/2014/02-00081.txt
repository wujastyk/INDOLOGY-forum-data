[INDOLOGY] Public statement from Wendy Doniger
The English of the legal/demand
notice<http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?289468>is generally
poor.  But in particular, what's all this "you noticee"?  Is
that just an error for "your noticee," or is it legal jargon?  I've never
seen it before, and I find no other references to the phrase anywhere on
the internet (Google).   Is it meant to be a vocative, addressing the
recipients of the notice?
I think it would be worthwhile at some point to go through this
legal/demand notice and refute the points one by one.  They are mostly
rather easy to knock down, as far as I can see.
