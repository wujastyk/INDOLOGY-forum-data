Subject: [INDOLOGY] Odia a new classical language for India
Message-ID: <CAKdt-CeT8t9cWP-sfnBvsHKkT0X0O78Hsi7z7S6J_3bRYMQd2Q@mail.gmail.com>

The Hindu reports today that Odia now joins Sanskrit, Tamil, Telugu,
Kannada and Malayalam as an official "classical language" of India.

It would be nice if we could now look forward to the opening of many new
departments of classics in Indian universities, and the appointment of
professorships and lectureships to support the study of the Indian
classics!  And an acceptance by banks, computer companies and other
employers that a degree in classics is a valid and valuable education for
any subsequent profession.

Best,
