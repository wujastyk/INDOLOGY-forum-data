Dear Simon,

I hope you do not mind that I reply to the list:

I?m happy to say that the bandwidth issues have been resolved (meaning also that members may access their personal settings, passwords, etc), and as of today, there are 542 members (or at least distinct email addresses) on the Indology mailing list. 

All best wishes,
Adheesh

I hope the committee will see fit to announce this number -- if it can be ascertained -- to the list as a whole, as soon as the unfortunate computer problems have been addressed. ...
