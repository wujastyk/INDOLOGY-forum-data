But Tim, those of us outside the USA have to be careful about the Sanskrit
Library materials.  When you use the SL, you have to agree to a lot of
legal terms, including

Software from this site is further subject to United States export
controls. Software from this site may not be downloaded or otherwise
exported or reexported outside the United States. By downloading or using
the Software, you represent and warrant that you are not located in, under
the control of, or a national or resident of any country or territory
outside of the United States.

If we use the transliteration program that you pointed to, it probably
uploads software to our browser.  For people outside the USA, that
contravenes the terms of the SL agreement.

Who cares, right?  But still.

Best,
Dominik
