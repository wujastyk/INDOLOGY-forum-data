[INDOLOGY] Alchemy metaphor
This is a rather wonderful discussion!  Thanks to all for adding evidence.
The video Dominik posted seems very important insofar as our authors were
in touch with reality, which I like to think they were. Taking account as
best I can of what everyone has said, and the physical evidence, here is my
new translation of the passage. Comments most welcome.
*yad? tu par?m???a-nityatva-vy?pitv?di-dharmakai?varya-ghan?tman?
ahambh?va-siddharasena ??ny?di-deha-dh?tv-anta? vidhyate yena prameyatv?t
tat cyavata iva, tad? turyada??*;
But when [all the layers of limited selfhood] from the Void to the tissues
of the body are penetrated by the ?alchemical elixir? that is the [true]
I-sense?replete with the sovereignty in which the qualities of eternality,
all-pervasiveness, etc. are cognized [as aspects of that ?I?]?through which
[penetration-cum-transmutation] their objectivity falls away as it were,
then that is [called] the Fourth State.
*yad?pi viddho 'sau pr??adeh?di-dh?tu? sa?vid-rasena abhinivi??o ?tyanta?
kanaka-dh?tur iva j?r?a? kriyate yena sa druta-rasa iva ?bh?ti kevala?
tat-sa?sk?ra?, tad?pi tury?t?ta-da?? s? bhavati*
When, further, these elements of *pr?**?a*, body, etc., penetrated by the
elixir of Consciousness, are thoroughly permeated [by it], they are [then]
?digested? like the element of gold [is by mercury], by which the
?liquified essence? [of consciousness], their purifier, alone appears ?
then too it becomes the state Beyond the Fourth.
