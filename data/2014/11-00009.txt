Dear Dr. Oliver Hellwig,

Excellent resource!!! This resource created by you is a great support to the world of linguists. Thank you so much. 

Can you please give an exhaustive list of works you are planning to add, so that others can avoid duplication or can share resources they got. 

With best regards

More details about the input conventions are available when you press the help button on the website. The rest of the website should be self explanatory.
