Dear Friends,
I received the following mail today. The correspondent, retired Professor
of English at the University of Calcutta, was a student of
D.P.Chattopadhyay and has devoted himself to the study of C?rv?ka and the
lok?yatas.
If this is being twice posted kindly ignore it.
?DEAR PROFESSOR,
IF THE ALLEGATION PROVES CORRECT, I'M PREPARED TO BOYCOTT MLBD. IF A
PROTEST IS TO BE MADE,  DO INCLUDE MY NAME.
