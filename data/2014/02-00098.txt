[INDOLOGY] Public statement from Wendy Doniger
As I recall, the British Indian law on this subject is discussed in the introduction to:
Publications proscribed by the government of India : a catalogue of the collections in the India Office Library and Records and the Department of Oriental Manuscripts and Printed Books, British Library Reference Division / edited by Graham Shaw and Mary Lloyd.?London: British Library, 1985.
The British authorities were, I believe, worried primarily about riots.??A number of the books and pamphlets banned were religious polemics rather than attacks on British rule.

Of course, Hitler's Mein Kampf is readily available in almost any Indian bookstall.
