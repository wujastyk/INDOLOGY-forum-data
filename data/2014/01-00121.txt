[INDOLOGY] fr.Wikipedia and other non sa.wikipedia
Fabrice,
I do contribute to Wikipedia (and even write Indological reviews on Amazon or on PhilPapers) whenever I happen to read an article and find something incorrect in it, although I try hard to look for more reliable sources (e.g., the Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy). However, I never contributed to the Italian, French or German Indological sections of Wikipedia. Why so? Because they are much worse, as far as I can judge, than the English version and because I see no point in scattering energies through many Wikis. I understand that it makes sense to contribute to the, e.g., German Wiki when I have something important to add about Austrian Literature or about any other German-specific topic. But I do not think that there are enough Italian or German Indologists who do not read English. Nor am I ready to start to engage in a war against the English super-potency (although I can feel the paradox of preserving the Indian ideo-diversity while neglecting the European linguistic diversity). Further, quite frankly, French, Italian or German Indologists in fact need to be able to read English without any hesitation. 
Long story short: perhaps you are the only one contributing to the French Wikipedia, but not the only French speaking Indologist who contributes to Wikipedia.
