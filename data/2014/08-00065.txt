[INDOLOGY] References on women scholars in ancient and medieval	India
Dear colleagues,
I have been asked by a non indologist colleague for references on women
scholars in ancient and medieval India. Do you know of an article or a book
which would deal directly with this subject?
I have noted so far for him:
Witzel, Michael. 2009. Female Rishis and philosophers in the
Veda? Journal of South Asia Women Studies 11(1).
http://asiatica.org/jsaws/11-1/female-rishis-and-philosophers-veda/
And
Mary McGee, Ritual Rights The Gender Implications of Adhikdra in L. Patton
ed Jewels of Authority, OUP 2002. 32-50 (esp. p.42)
but this is very meager and vedic...
I can't help but feel that there is a very obvious reference that I must be
lacking
thanking you in advance for your help,
Agathe
