[INDOLOGY] References on women scholars in ancient and medieval	India
Dear colleagues,
I want to thank you again for gathering all these wonderful references.
Those of you who know me, would have guessed that I was thinking especially
of woman scientists (who can be also writers of course).
Still this will be useful no doubt to my colleague!
