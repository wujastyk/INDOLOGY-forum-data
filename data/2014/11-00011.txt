[INDOLOGY] Childhood and Children in Ancient India
Dear Donald,
it may be not exactly what you mean but you can find interesting
information in few jyoti?a-texts dealing with HIndu rituals and children
and
in the B?latantra by Kaly??a (approx 16th c. CE), or in other ayurvedic
texts.
Also, I would suggest you to look at the M?nasoll?sa.
Yours,
Ales.
