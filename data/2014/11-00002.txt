[INDOLOGY] Citalebhatta Prakarana (Bombay, 1926) by RS Pimputkar
Dear Samuel,
Perhaps helpful in your search might be Rosalind O?Hanlon?s note that ?These documents have been reprinted in C. Y. Mule et al (eds), _Devarukhe_ (Bombay: Ramesh Visnu Nimbkar, 1973), pp. 87-107.? (cited in O?Hanlon, ?Letters Home: Brahman Pandits and the Maratha Regions in Early Modern India,? _Modern Asian Studies_ 44(2010): 201-240, p. 239.) 
[I should say that a quick search does not, however, reveal any obvious sources for this reprint either!]
All best wishes,
Adheesh
