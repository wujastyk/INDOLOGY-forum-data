Dear Samuel,

Perhaps helpful in your search might be Rosalind O?Hanlon?s note that ?These documents have been reprinted in C. Y. Mule et al (eds), _Devarukhe_ (Bombay: Ramesh Visnu Nimbkar, 1973), pp. 87-107.? (cited in O?Hanlon, ?Letters Home: Brahman Pandits and the Maratha Regions in Early Modern India,? _Modern Asian Studies_ 44(2010): 201-240, p. 239.) 

[I should say that a quick search does not, however, reveal any obvious sources for this reprint either!]

All best wishes,
Adheesh
