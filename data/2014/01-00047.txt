Recent advances in this topic, mainly yet not exclussively on Buddhist sources, were offered by Jonathan Silk, Vanessa Sasson and Amy Langenberg, with some titles freely available, e.g.

Dear colleagues,
A student of mine (not a Sanskritist) wants to write her magister thesis about the childhood of men and childhood of gods in comparative perspective. Could you suggest some special literature on the topic, or some papers on childhood in classical India?
With best regards,
Victoria
