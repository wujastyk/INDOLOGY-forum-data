[INDOLOGY] Churning king Vena
Compare in Rm 7, App. I no. 8, the birth of the Videha king Mithi/Janaka (the First) from the mummified body of king Nimi which was used as an ara?i (nimer deham? ara?i? tatra nik?ipya), from which, through  "churning" (mathana) by the priests, Mithi was born (ara?y?? mathyam?n?y?? pr?durbh?to mah?tap? | mathan?n mithir ity ?hur, ll. 208-9 = V?P 89.5, B?P 2,3,64.5). Cf. ViP 4, 5.9 (itself followed by BhgP 9,13) with the expression ?ar?ram? [a]ra?y? (instr. crit. ed., better than loc. ara?y?m var. mss.) mamanthu? : the ara?i referred to here should be the uttar? whereas the mummified body on the ground is used as the adhara-ara?i (like in the Rm - V?P-B?P common passage), the one in the yoni of which the point of the upper-one is fitted into and turned.
The episode of the churning of king Vena was dealt with by Georges Dum?zil in his interesting mythological study of king P?thu (Vena's Son), which forms a long part of his work "Servius et la Fortune" (Paris, 1943, pp. 33-111; more recently on P?thu, see Marcelle Saindon, 'Le bon roi P?thu et la traite de la vache Terre: un plaidoyer en faveur de la Terre nourrici?re ? prot?ger des violences',  Studies in Religion 36/3-4, 2007, pp. 553-569).
