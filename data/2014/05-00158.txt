Her siding with the leftists too did not last. From 2005 to the end Sukumari was shunned by all -- the right and the left. The sole grace was that publishers did not shun her. Sukumari was not sorry.
Her non-conformist character placed Sukumari in opposition to a number of Indologists including Professor Gonda. Perhaps Burrow had remained fond of her.
