Does anyone out there have a copy of the following paper: 

Author: Larson, Gerald
Title: An Old Problem Revisited: The Relation between Samkhya, Yoga and Buddhism
Journal:  Studien zur Indologie und Iranistik. vol 15 (1989) 129-146.

It took 3 weeks for our Interlibrary loan department to send me the wrong pages. 
I need the article by next week and so I am afraid to try to order it through the usual channels.

Thanks,
-j

Subject: [INDOLOGY] A brief introduction into the Indian metrical system for    the use of students.

Dear all
(specially the instructors of Sanskrit)

I would like to inform you that I have just uploaded to www.academia.edu
a very modest paper (unpublished), "A brief introduction into the Indian
metrical system for the use of students," that attempts at summarizing on
just six pages the very essentials of classical Sanskrit metrics. On its
last page you will find a list of the 25 most common Sanskrit metres
that saves the student the trouble to go through the long list in Apte's
dictionary. Several colleagues found this draft (originally prepared for
classes at UC Berkeley) helpful. That is the reason why I have decided
to make it generally accessible. Any criticism will be greatly appreciated.

Michael Hahn
