Hi, Ken,

As I'm sure you know, in the classic P?ta?jalayoga??stra of Pata?jali,
s?tra 2.30 lists five yamas, beginning with ahi?s?.  I don't know the
Ha?hayogaprad?pik? well, but Sv?tm?r?ma (or whoever) gives 10 yamas in the
addendum to 1.16 (or 1.17 in my 1972 Adyar Library ed.). So even if ahi?s?
is a yama there, as in PY?, there's already a willingness to depart from
the classic list of yamas, doubling its size.   Another item has crossed
list in 1.17; thus ?auca is a niyama in the PY? but has become a yama in
the HYP.  I'd guess that the yama/niyama (commitment/obligation)
distinction wasn't that well-defined by Sv?tm?r?ma's time.

As an aside, Buddhaghosa works with five Niyamas (or niy?mas).

In the Milindapa?ha, niyamas are mostly paired with sa?yamas (not yamas).
The lists overlap with Pata?jali. I haven't looked at this closely.

Best,
Dominik
