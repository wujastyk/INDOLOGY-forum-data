Without doubt, many narrations from Bharata influence the South Asia places in its folk. But this specific relate is diferent of Maharaja Sibi history.

Perhaps the sea of fire in
the Indonesian myth should not be the Va?av? of Indian mythology. Va?av? is
rather the fire that resides in water which is its fuel. Cf., abindhana?
vahnim asau bibharti Raghu 13.5 said of the sea. The fire residing in the
deep sea seems to have been referred to in also in Ya?t 19.46-53. Long ago (2005)
I merely speculated that the related ideas might have their origin in the sight
of natural fire produced in mineral oil by the undivided Aryans. This cannot be
pressed I admit. But the sea of fire is missing both in Indian and Iranian
versions.
Best wishes for all

>>I post the following question on behalf of a friend. It concerns the following scene from a Malay adventure story from Sumatra, the Hikayat Bahram Syah, dated in the first half of the 19th?century:
>>On the back of a bird the hero flies across a sea of fire. To prevent the bird from falling down he feeds it with pieces of flesh from his own leg. After they have safely arrived at the other shore the bird vomits, giving up the piece of flesh which attaches itself to the hero's leg again.
>>The scene contains at least two elements otherwise known from India, namely the?va?av?nala?at the bottom of the sea and the a hero giving his own flesh to a predator (King ?ibi). What my friend wants to know if the story as a whole occurs in Indian literature.
