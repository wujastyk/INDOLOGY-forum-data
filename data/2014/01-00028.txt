Perhaps the sea of fire in
the Indonesian myth should not be the Va?av? of Indian mythology. Va?av? is
rather the fire that resides in water which is its fuel. Cf., abindhana?
vahnim asau bibharti Raghu 13.5 said of the sea. The fire residing in the
deep sea seems to have been referred to in also in Ya?t 19.46-53. Long ago (2005)
I merely speculated that the related ideas might have their origin in the sight
of natural fire produced in mineral oil by the undivided Aryans. This cannot be
pressed I admit. But the sea of fire is missing both in Indian and Iranian
versions.
Best wishes for all
