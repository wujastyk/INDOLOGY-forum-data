[INDOLOGY] Report: 6th Intl. Vedic Workshop
Dear All,
from Jan.7- 10, the 6th International Vedic Workshop took place at Kozhikode (Calicut), Kerala. It was excellently organized by the local committee.
This was followed by a tour to Nambudiri Brahmin villages in Central Kerala, where the three Vedas are taught and elaborate Shrauta rituals are performed still.
Both a great and pleasurable experiences! Here my report:
