[INDOLOGY] Vedas: Divisions, Dating and Language
On textual divisions, might I also recommend the following?
L. Renou, "Les divisions dans les textes sanskrits", IIJ 1 (1957) 1-32 (= Choix d??tudes indiennes. R?unies par N. Balbir et G.-J. Pinault. Paris 1997, II/487-518).
And perhaps my own article, "The Textual Divisions of the Paippal?da Sa?hit?", WZKS 47 (2003), 5-35.
Best wishes,

    Dear
      Indology List members,
      I appreciate that this may seem a basic question. It's so basic, I
      don't have any fantastic references!
      I was hoping for references to authoritative accounts of the
      division of the Vedas into versions (Rg, Yajur etc.,), parts
      (Mantra, Brahmana etc.)  and dates in English.
      I was also interested in linguistic accounts of the Vedas that
      might distinguish the earlier and later Vedas on linguistic lines.
      All help is most appreciated!
      Gratefully yours,
      Shyam
