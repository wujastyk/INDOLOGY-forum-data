Dear All:

A while back I asked you about the 18 low castes, and I received very helpful pointers, some of which I append below. But I am now writing about a parallel list of these 18 that are called by M?dhava (P?r??aram?dhav?ya, III: 46) and Deva??a Bha??a (Sm?ticandrik?, Mysore Editon, III: 65) in verses ascribed to Pit?maha "prak?ti" castes that are outside the var?as and ??ramas. There is one verse containing probably 11 names (the first verse has 7 names and are easily identified). I am unable to decipher several of them, and the readings of the two texts also vary -- thus I am not sure what the right reading is. But here is the verse in the two versions:

???????????????????????????????????: ? ?????????????????????????????: ?? Deva??a  
??????????????????: ?????????????????: ? ??????????: ??????? ??????: ???????: ?? M?dhava (Bombay ed)
??????????????????????? ??????????????? ? ????????: ??????????????????????: ?? M?dhava (Calcatta ed)

As you can see there is a lot of confusion, and I am not sure whether the editors themselves fully understood the passage. Any help greatly appreciated.

Thanks.

Patrick

Here is what I gathered about the 18 low castes in South India from members of the list:

A passage ascribed to the Garu?a Pur??a in Hemadri's Caturvargacint?ma?i (IV: 38) gives a list of 16 headed by washerman, calling them Ca???las who live in the village. In Maharashtra today there are lists of 18 low-caste people, and this may have been true in other parts of southern India where Devanna Bhatta lived (personal communication by Ashok Aklujkar). A closer parallel is found in the Tamil country, where also we have 18 such castes, again beginning with the washerman, listed in the Madras Tamil Lexicon: va???n? [washerman], n?vitan? [barber], kuyavan? [potter], ta???n? [goldsmith], kan?n??n? [brazier], kar?r?accan? [mason], kollan? [blacksmith], taccan? [carpenter], e??eyv??ikan? [oil merchant], uppuv??ikan? [salt merchant], ilaiv??ikan? [betel merchant], pa??i [watchman], p?m?laikk?ran? [garland maker], par?aiyan? [drummer; Dalit, pariah], k?vi?ku?iy?n? [conch-blower], ?ccan? [priest at a goddes temple; another Dalit community], valaiyan? [fisherman], p??an? [tailor]. I thank Whitney Cox for this reference.
