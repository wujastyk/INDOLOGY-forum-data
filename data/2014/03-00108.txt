First of all you should clearly distinguish Gregorian calendar and 
Julian calendar.

Since Gregorian calendar started on 15 October 1582, dates before should
be given in Julian calendar. Thus you should be careful when you use?
the online tool http://www.usvishakh.net/php/kaligreg.php which does
not show Julian Calendar.

Here is my comments according to my pancanga program which you can run 
at:
http://www.cc.kyoto-su.ac.jp/~yanom/pancanga/index.html.

Julin day 1611111 falls on 1310 Feb.11 (Wednesday) by Julian calendar.
The same day can be 1310 Feb. 19 by Gregorian calendar, but as I wrote
above, this is misleading.

JD 84508610 is impossible (too large number!).

`Converter: 1500 April 1 (Sunday)' ?would be also in Gregorian,?
and it should be 1500 April 12 (Sunday) (JD 1680569) in Julian calendar.
?

JD 1680548 falls on 1500 March 22 (Sunday) in Julian Calendar, not 
Gregorian.
The solar calendar date is Mina 27, Kali 4601. (4600 is wrong. Mina 26
is possible depending on the definition of solar date).?

In this sense K. Ramasubramanian's dating is misleading.

JD 1723201 falls on 1617 January 10 (Tuesday) by Gregorian calendar.
JD 1723261 falls on 1617 March 11 (Saturday) by Gregorian calendar.
Both are OK.

JD 1712210 falls on 1586 December 8 (Monday) by Gregorian calendar which 
is
1586 November 28 by Julian calendar.

Remember that Gregorian calendar was officially in use only after 1752
in British ruled countries including India. (This is the reason why the
pancanga program gives double dates between 1582 and 1752).

With best wishes,
