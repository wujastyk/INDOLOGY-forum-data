[INDOLOGY] Fwd: Attack on Academic Freedom
My colleague Prof. Mukharji noted the following:
Attack on Academic Freedom
Dear Friends,
Following on from his success in getting Wendy Doniger's book off the
Indian market, the RSS and Mr Batra have now attacked Sekhar
Bandyopadhyay's excellent textbook on modern South Asian history, *From
Plassey to Partition.*
With the change of government in Delhi publishers too are increasingly
reluctant to take on the RSS and its censorship mechanism whilst the
mainstream media is also pushing the news to the margins.
In this context of a spreading culture of silence and self-censorship,
please help spread the news of this new attack on academic freedom in
India. Below are a few links to media reports of the controversy including
the report in the RSS mouthpiece, *The Organiser *threatening "agitation"
if their legal challenge fails.
Please forward these to fellow academics if you can
