[INDOLOGY] Visuddhimagga
Dear Dr. Wujastyk,
There is a great paper by Steven Collins, dealing with exactly these
matters:
Remarks on the *Visuddhimagga*, and on its treatment of the Memory of
Former Dwelling(s) (pubbeniv?s?nussati???a)
Journal of Indian Philosophy (2009), 37:499?532.
Please find it attached.
Interestingly, it contains in a large footnote ?22 surprisingly severe
criticism of the E. Frauwallner's academic method.
With best regards,
Gleb Sharygin.
