Dear Dr Chakrabarti,
Thanks for this link: let there be research on gene pools and genetic
lineages from every perspective, including the modern Indian one.
The Error was (19th cent and nazi-time Aryan Invasion Theory) and is
(Out-of-India-Theory) to think that GENETICS (and racial theories) can
provide explanations in cultural questions in history, such as the
well-attested spread of vedism between 1500 BCE (north-west of Indian
subcontinent) and 1500 AD (throughout Indian subcontinent). Many scholars
have remained unconvinced and unhappy with explanations in these terms from
the beginning, innumerable are those who suffered from attempts to base
state implemented policies on these theories but scientific 'truth' is
'truth' and in the absence of any other explanation ... As I have been
arguing in several studies, however, in our understanding of the phenomenon
of the spread of vedism GENETICS need not be invoked at all as a crucial
factor as it is to be understood rather in terms of MEMETICS and MEMORY
CULTURE taking into account vedism's interaction over centuries with its
ecological and economic environment (for instance
http://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00673190). Worries about genetic
lineage became obsessively important only secondarily in the last or
K-strategist (niche-exploitation) phase of vedism reflected in a relatively
late work such as Manu (on Hitler and Manu see Halbfass India and Europe p
139).
Best regards, Jan Houben
