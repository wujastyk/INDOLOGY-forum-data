[INDOLOGY] Looking for an article
Dear All,
I am looking for a PDF of the following article:
"Concept of Tattva - A Study" by D.B. Sensharma, Published in Gopinath Kaviraj Felicitation Volume, Lucknow, 1967.>>
Would someone happened to have a PDF copy of this? I would indeed be grateful if someone has it and can share with me. 
Best wishes.
Mrinal Kaul
