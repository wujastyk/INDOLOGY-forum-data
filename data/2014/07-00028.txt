Message-ID: <E9C304E9-3F7B-452A-AF39-10614187DA8F@gmail.com>

Dear All,

I am looking for a PDF of the following article:

"Concept of Tattva - A Study" by D.B. Sensharma, Published in Gopinath Kaviraj Felicitation Volume, Lucknow, 1967.>>

Would someone happened to have a PDF copy of this? I would indeed be grateful if someone has it and can share with me. 

Best wishes.

Mrinal Kaul
