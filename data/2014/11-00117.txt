Dear Professors Deshpande and Chevillard,

In trying to learn the full extent of K. V. Abhyankar's publications, I
just happened across his review of an earlier work by M. S.
Narasimhacharya. The review is more about the work than the author, but
here is the citation in case it may be of use. The Annals (truly a treasure
trove) readily yield more reviews of Narasimhacharya's work (including the
one first mentioned) so I've included a couple of those as well.

May I ask, do you suppose it could be V. S. Abhyankar to whom Dr. Filliozat
refers? How astonishing! Or perhaps an earlier member of that learned
family?

Best regards to all the list,
Jo
