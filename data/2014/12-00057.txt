[INDOLOGY] Traditional/ insider's view of language or dialect status of Prakrits
Dear Professor Paturi,
If I may direct you to my own book:  Deshpande-Sanskrit & Prakrit -
Sociolinguistic Issues (Book MLBD 1993).  This book discusses many of the
questions that you have raised in your message.  With best wishes,
Madhav Deshpande
