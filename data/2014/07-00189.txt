[INDOLOGY] Soo che? Saru che... Gujarati
Thanks to Jay Soni and Bindu Bhatt for their quick replies. I've now got 
the correct Gujarati text. I'll be away from the computer for a few days 
now so I won't be able to respond quickly to any further contributions.
The only thing I still don't know is whether ? is pronounced as a 
palatal in standard Gujarati, or does it sound the same as ?, becoming 
dental as it does in the language of many Hindi speakers (though not 
standard Hindi).
All the best,
Daniel
