Re: [INDOLOGY] Public statement from Wendy Doniger
As I recall, the British Indian law on this subject is discussed in the introduction to:
Publications proscribed by the government of India : a catalogue of the collections in the India Office Library and Records and the Department of Oriental Manuscripts and Printed Books, British Library Reference Division / edited by Graham Shaw and Mary Lloyd. London: British Library, 1985.
The British authorities were, I believe, worried primarily about riots.  A number of the books and pamphlets banned were religious polemics rather than attacks on British rule.
