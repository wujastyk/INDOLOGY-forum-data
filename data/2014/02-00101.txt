From: INDOLOGY [mailto:indology-bounces at list.indology.info] On Behalf Of Allen Thrasher
Sent: Thursday, February 13, 2014 12:42 AM
To: Dominik Wujastyk; Matthew Kapstein
Cc: Indology
Subject: Re: [INDOLOGY] Public statement from Wendy Doniger


As I recall, the British Indian law on this subject is discussed in the introduction to:

Publications proscribed by the government of India : a catalogue of the collections in the India Office Library and Records and the Department of Oriental Manuscripts and Printed Books, British Library Reference Division / edited by Graham Shaw and Mary Lloyd. London: British Library, 1985.

The British authorities were, I believe, worried primarily about riots.  A number of the books and pamphlets banned were religious polemics rather than attacks on British rule.
