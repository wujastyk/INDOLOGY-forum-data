*A brief account of work:*
        Upasargama??anam deals with the meanings of various roots when
upasargas are attached to them. Ma??ana has used the roots from
Kavikalpadruma, a dh?tup??ha of Vopadeva. This is more than obvious,
because author has himself stated that this work is meant to be a section
or supplement to Kavikalpadruma[1]. The dh?tup??ha only lists the meanings
of roots, and not those generated by applying upasargas to them. Our author
has tried to bridge that gap by this treatise.
        The work is unique in a sense that this is the only work of its
time to have listed the changes in the meanings of roots when upasargas are
applied to them. All other works on upasargas have done it the other way
round. They have taken an upasarga and explained different meanings of
upasargas, taking some roots as examples[2]. Upasargama??anam is probably
the first treatise which takes a particular root for treatment and examines
its various meanings with different upasargas.
Upasargama??anam starts with salutation to the god (stanza 1). The author
bows to Jina?s feet. This salutation tells us that Ma??ana belonged to Jain
faith. We will examine this issue later on. The next stanzas provide
information regarding the ancestry of the author (2-4). Following the
tradition of providing the cause of creation and usefulness of the work,
Ma??ana provides the same in the next two stanzas (5-6). ?The meanings of
roots combined with upasargas are not provided in Kavikalpadruma, this work
provides it. This work, namely Upasargama??anam, is supposed to be a
skandha (Section / chapter) of Kavikapladruma.? Thus, the author makes it
abundantly clear that this work is supplemental to Vopadeva?s
Kavilalpadruma and supplies the meanings of upasarga ? root combination,
which is not provided in Kavikalpadruma (and for that matter in any
dh?tup??ha). Kavikalpadruma randomly sometimes provides meanings of roots
with upasargas, but that is a rarity rather than rule. The examples
are: ???????????
??????????? ?????????????? ? ?????????????????? (220-221), ???????????????
????????????????????? ??? ? (206), ??? ??? ??? ? ??? ????? ? ??????????
?????? ???? ??? (207) etc. Therefore the author took that job unto himself
to fill the gap. This compilation has around 2350 meanings for ?upasarga +
root? combinations. Thus the word of the author ??????????? is also
justified.
After the introductory part is over, the main text starts (7-338ab). In
this section the roots are arranged as per their order in Kavikalpadruma.
In rare cases, the order is changed. Kavikalpadruma has a peculiar way of
arranging the roots i.e. by the last letter of the root. In a way, it can
be called the earliest reverse dictionary in Sanskrit language. Upasargama??
anam has covered ???????? to ???????? roots in this part.
Upasargama??anam doesn?t
attend to ????? roots, because they are not supposed to be used in
literature, but only in their specific use in the grammar. Therefore, it
ends with ???????? unlike Kavikalpadruma, which ends in ????? roots.
Stanzas 337cd-343 deal with the general meanings of upasargas, which
roughly correspond to the upasrgav?ttis mentioned earlier. After dealing
with specific ?upasarga + root? combination, he mentions general meanings
of upasargas, which are fashioned on the lines of upasrgav?ttis mentioned
under earlier under footnote 15. We will deal with this portion in later
section of introduction.
Colophon of the work gives us details about the name, profession, lineage
and patronage of the author and the date and place of the composition. This
is very interesting portion because it shows that the Muslim King of Malwa
had a Jain prime minister at that time. We will examine this in detail in
the section on the author.
        The post-colophon entry of the work is different in all the three
manuscripts. The only dated manuscript is Ms. C, which is written on K?rtika
sudi 11, ?ukradina (Friday), 1504 Vikrama Samvat i.e. 1935-1936 A.D. It is
written by oneK?yastha Vin?ikad?sa. The other two undated manuscripts also
bear the name of the same scribe, but as we have already noted before,
these two seem later composition.
