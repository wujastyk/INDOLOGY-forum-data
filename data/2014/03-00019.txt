[INDOLOGY] Siddhasara of Ravigupta: scan of Emmerick's tr?
Dear colleagues,
A scholar whom Prof. Michael Hahn has been assisting is working on a Hindi
tr. of the Sanskrit Siddhas?ra by Ravigupta.  Prof. Hahn is seeking a scan
of the English tr. that Emmerick did of the Tibetan version of that text
(i.e., vol.2<https://openlibrary.org/works/OL6426899W/The_Siddhasa%CC%84ra_of_Ravigupta>).
I've looked in the usual places (Google, DLI, archive.org, scribd.com,
etc.), but drawn a blank.  Does anyone here have a scan they would be
willing to share.  It's the English tr. only that's needed.
With thanks,
