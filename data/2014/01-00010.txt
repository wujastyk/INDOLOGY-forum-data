[INDOLOGY] Hess' "SIDDHARTHA" in Sanskrit
Dear Dominik,
It is clear that I have not mentioned a single email address of any  
members of any LISTS.  No one will get the electronic Siddharta  
without personally asking for it.
The email addresses of the LISTS themselves are public, aren't they?  
If it was an error on my part to make these known to persons mentioned  
in my Cc, I sincerely apologise for this.
Thank you in any case for the caution you raised.
With best wishes,
Jay
