In most American Universities, the word "Indology" is almost unheard of
these days.  After Edward Said's "Orientalism", the word "Oriental"
survives in a few universities only as an exception.  The Department of
Oriental Studies at the University of Pennsylvania where I earned my Ph.D.
in 1972 became Asian and Middle Eastern Studies in 1992.  "India" has been
largely replaced by "South Asia" in most places.  Once I introduced to
someone as being an Indologist, and the person asked me if that was a
department in the hospital!
