Dear Dominik,
Thanks for this well-formulated and timely statement.
To facilitate sharing and add momentum a Twitter link may be useful as
suggested by Jean-Luc Chevillard (#MLBDcontroversy).
On the other hand, it may not be very useful to go through the Times of
India or the Hindu, as a topic related to Hitler's crimes against humanity
cannot be expected to have any significant impact even on an educated
Indian public (for background see the article link provided by Luis
Gonzales-Reiman). I have noted the very easy and trivial use of the word
"hitler" in various Indian languages where it seems to have become
lexicalized in the sense of "severe person" (see also the occasional use of
the term in well-known Bollywood films and the soap serial Hitler Didi
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitler_Didi).
