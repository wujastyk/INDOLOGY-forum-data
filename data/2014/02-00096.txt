Subject: [INDOLOGY] unwarranted digression
Message-ID: <82C3E42590D939418C74DD76B97DDED0821CB7@xm-mbx-04-prod.ad.uchicago.edu>

My comment was to a thread concerning the treatment of Wendy Doniger's work.
Someone then took my comment and began a new thread, with a new name, on the basis of it.
I had no desire to begin a thread on the present subject, which has been
tiresomely rehashed in discussion after discussion.

My sole concern was with censorship in India, which has a clear and immediate pertinence.

If any of you really wish to spin round and round over the nazi question,
be my guests.
