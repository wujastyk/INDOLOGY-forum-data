[INDOLOGY] Pali question
Dear Chris,
Your elucidation is of course legitimate, although I should like to note
that K.R. Norman in his revision of W. Geiger's grammar (PTS, Oxford, 2005)
has not supplied any additional notes on that matter. He merely states that
"hitv?" is a correct form, see ?? 209-210. The early PTS editors didn't
have many MSS. at their disposal, and MSS. do contain typos, mistakes and
erroneous readings. Newer editions, though not "fully academic", are often
more trustworthy. According to the CST 4.0, there are 603 matches for
"hitv?" in 111 P?li "books", while there are no matches for "hitva" at all.
But the problem of readings is delicate, so, probably, it's a good idea to
wait for the "Dhammakaya edition" academic paleographers' take on this
issue. The issue is also discussed in the T. Oberlies' "P?li" (2001,
Berlin, p. 126, ? 25), where it is suggested, in short, that "hitva" is a
rare, occasional form (which occasionally, not as a rule, happens if a
sandhi consonant "m" is inserted: "hitvama??a?"). The point I should I like
to stress is that "-tv?" and  "-tva" are not equally legitimate and correct
forms. And in my opinion the best answer to the original question "Is hitv?
(long a) a legitimate variant..?" would be: "hitv?" is perfectly standard,
correct and legitimate, while "hitva" is rare and problematic".
