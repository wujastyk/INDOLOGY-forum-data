[INDOLOGY] Tattvasamgraha-panjika
Dear colleagues,
Does anyone know where I can find an e-copy of a Sanskrit edition 
Kamala??la's Tattvasamgraha-pa?jik?? I know the grammatically parsed version 
of ??ntarak?ita's root verses on GRETIL but have been unable to find an 
e-version of the pa?jik?. Even a PDF would be ok, but if there is a 
searchable romanized version, that would be ideal.
Thank you.
