[INDOLOGY] Chandamama Sanskrit Archives
Dear List,
I will be much pleased to know if any of you has got the Chandamama magazine's Sanskrit Archives and is willing to share. A few years ago, the Chandamama archives were available in all of its languages for free download, but after the website <http://www.chandamama.com/> (which is currently down) was updated they're no longer there. Somebody has very kindly uploaded to Archive.org<https://archive.org/search.php?query=collection%3Achandamama_magazine&sort=-publicdate> the English archives from 1955 to 1985 but Sanskrit ones are literally nowhere to find.
Best Wishes,
Rohana
