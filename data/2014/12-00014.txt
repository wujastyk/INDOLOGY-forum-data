Subject: [INDOLOGY] Scriptures and yugas in the Tantras
Message-ID: <5480A07F.3030404@unicatt.it>

Dear colleagues,

At p. 42 of his/_Introduction to Tantra??stra/_  as well as at p. 36 of 
his _/Principles of Tantra/_  Woodroffe/Avalon has the Kul?r?ava Tantra 
say that ?for each age (yuga) a suitable ??stra is given ? namely, in 
Satyayuga, ?ruti; in Tret?, Sm?ti; in Dv?para, the Pur??as; and in the 
Kali age the Tantra?, and even quotes in a footnote the following ?loka:

/k?te ?rutyukta ?c?ras tret?y?? sm?tisambhava?//
//dv?pare tu pur??okta? kalau ?gamakevalam/

without, however, giving a reference. I don?t know of any searchable 
digital text of the Kul?r?ava Tantra, so I have tried to spot the 
passage by leafing through the digital edition in Bengali script by 
Upendrakum?ra D?sa which is available in the Internet Archive, without 
success.

Woodroffe further points to the first /ull?sa /of the Mah?nirv??a 
Tantra, as well to the Kubj?ka Tantra (likewise without reference) for a 
similar allocation of the scriptures to each of the four ages.

Would any /t?ntrika /on the list be in measure to identify the passage, 
or point out similar passages in other tantric works?

Thank you,
Paolo Magnone
