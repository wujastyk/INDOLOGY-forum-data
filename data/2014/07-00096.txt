[INDOLOGY] Alchemy metaphor
Dear Ashok,
There is absolutely no ambiguity about what translates what in the Tibetan version:
shin tu cher sgyur bar byed pa?i phyir mchog tu sgyur ba?o
?It is the finest transformer because it causes very great transformation.?
can only be a rendering of
atyuccavedhak?ritv?d at?va vedhan?yam
and nothing else. The formation of the Tibetan is quite transparent:
atyucca = shin tu cher, "very much, exceedingly"
vedha- = sgyur bar, "to transform, change (x) into (y), translate"
k?ritv?d = byed pa?i phyir, "because it does/makes/causes"
at?va = mchog tu, "finest, to the highest degree"
vedhan?yam = sgyur ba?o, "transforms, is that which transforms."
The rasaj?ta is mentioned in the preceding sentence, both in Skt. and its Tib. trans., but not at all here.
hope this helps to clarify,
as ever,
Matthew
