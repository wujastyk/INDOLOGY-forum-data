[INDOLOGY] Fwd: Yahoo's Blunder Impacts Mailing Lists Worldwide
Dear Dominik,
thanks for the information.
That explains why, yesterday, as the OWNER of the mailing list called 
CTAMIL (hosted by one CNRS server), I received an automatic message for 
which the subject line was:
**********************************************
"WARNING: bounce rate too high in list ctamil"
**********************************************
The message said
**********************************************
Bounce rate in list ctamil is 48.2.
You should delete bouncing subscribers
**********************************************
I did not delete any subscriber
but I immediately started to reset
the error level of 48% of the list members :-(
Each one of them had ONE BOUNCE.
After that, I crossed my fingers, hoping not to have to do it again :-)
I am glad to know there was a REASON
Cheers
