[INDOLOGY] Fwd:  Hitler and MLBD

Re: [INDOLOGY] Hitler and MLBD
And it is most probably a pirated edition. Hitler's Mein Kampf is still
under copyright in Germany (copyright ends 70 years after the author's
death, i.e. in 2015). Holder of rights is the Bavarian government in Munich
and they are generally very restrictive in granting printing permission. If
they do then mostly for commented selections for scholarly purposes
(recently the government has denied rights for a publication of a new
critical edition that is being prepared by German historians).
