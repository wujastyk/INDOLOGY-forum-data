Subject: [INDOLOGY] I am not the boss
Message-ID: <CAKdt-CfHHeeQ3WPK9ObMrVScrOKOKaOUYc9zt7_hT0qeTmmabQ@mail.gmail.com>

?Dear colleagues and friends,

The INDOLOGY list is run by a
committee<http://indology.info/email/email-comm/>.
I am a member of that committee, but I'm really not the boss.  All
decisions are taken jointly, and we have a rota that means that at any time
only one of us is on duty.  The rest of us are on a well-deserved break,
perhaps even *doing* indology. The committee's contact address is:

   - indology-owner at list.indology.info

I'd be truly grateful if any communications about this INDOLOGY list were
sent to the committee, and not to me personally.

Many thanks!

Dominik Wujastyk

INDOLOGY committee
