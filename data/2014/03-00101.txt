[INDOLOGY] I am not the boss
?Dear colleagues and friends,
The INDOLOGY list is run by a
committee<http://indology.info/email/email-comm/>.
I am a member of that committee, but I'm really not the boss.  All
decisions are taken jointly, and we have a rota that means that at any time
only one of us is on duty.  The rest of us are on a well-deserved break,
perhaps even *doing* indology. The committee's contact address is:
   - indology-owner at list.indology.info
I'd be truly grateful if any communications about this INDOLOGY list were
sent to the committee, and not to me personally.
Many thanks!
Dominik Wujastyk
INDOLOGY committee
