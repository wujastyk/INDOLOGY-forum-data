[INDOLOGY] Question on Sanskrit Syntax
Dear Dipak,
     Thanks for these clarifying comments.  The syntax of constructions
with passive forms of ?ak is very complicated.  Pata?jali's usage of
"?akyam (neuter nom) c?nena ?vam??s?dibhir api k?ut (fem nom) pratihantum"
in the Mah?bh??ya has generated long debates in the commentaries.  With
best wishes,
Madhav
