[INDOLOGY] INDOLOGY Digest, Vol 18, Issue 10
In reply to James Hartzell?s query on family traditions of Vedic recitation, I offer a short list of references pasted below, skewed towards my own interest in S?maveda and South Indian recitation. I?m actually in the initial stages of compiling an online bibliography on the topic of ?Vedic Oral Tradition,? and I would appreciate any additional references that our list-members could provide.

This is a rather wonderful discussion!  Thanks to all for adding evidence.
The video Dominik posted seems very important insofar as our authors were
in touch with reality, which I like to think they were. Taking account as
best I can of what everyone has said, and the physical evidence, here is my
new translation of the passage. Comments most welcome.

of the body are penetrated by the ?alchemical elixir? that is the [true]

all-pervasiveness, etc. are cognized [as aspects of that ?I?]?through which
[penetration-cum-transmutation] their objectivity falls away as it were,
then that is [called] the Fourth State.

When, further, these elements of *pr?**?a*, body, etc., penetrated by the
elixir of Consciousness, are thoroughly permeated [by it], they are [then]
?digested? like the element of gold [is by mercury], by which the
?liquified essence? [of consciousness], their purifier, alone appears ?
then too it becomes the state Beyond the Fourth.

commentary is very ??stric and elaborate (note the P??inian grammatical

one can say that their view represents the understanding of learned

transmutation.

Having looked at White's book The Alchemical Body, I can report that he
frequently takes *vedha *in the sense of "transmute" and
"transubstantiate". Of course, he is not a Sanskritist but an historian of
religion.  Dominik, is it true that vedha is often listed as the
seventeenth samsk?ra after the 16 rasa-sa?sk?ras, and is seen as their
fruit?  For such he claims in that book.

I don't know (without digging about, and I have no time just now).  But if
David says so, it's probably right.  He normally gives his sources.  What I
would say, though, is that the 16 sa?sk?ras are definitely the norm in the
classical picture, so a seventeenth sa?sk?ra is a bit like the seventh
cakra or the fifth veda, a late structural extension of a standard theory.
(Like Einstein to Newton and Schroedinger to Einstein :-)

Re: [INDOLOGY] Obituary of Professor S. Revathy
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="windows-1252"
Mr. Saha,
What a loss! I met Prof. Revathi, at that time ?Miss Revathy,? when I was a Fulbright scholar in Chennai in 1985. I was looking forward to reading with Prof. Veezhinathan but he was too busy. I was a little disappointed when he "handed me off," as I then thought, to his graduate student. How wrong I was! I learned more from her than most of the pandits I studied with that year put together. We read Vedantaparibhasa and Siddhantamuktavali. The depth of her knowledge and the precision of her explanations were awe-inspiring. It was from her that I learned that Indian logic matches Western logic in power, rigor, and clarity. She must have been summoned to some other world where she will converse with gods and continue her scholarly pursuits in the company of other Sanskrit luminaries. A spirit like hers could never be extinguished.

[Dr. S. Revathy]
Special Arrangement Dr. S. Revathy
TOPICS

Sanskrit students of the late Prof. Dr. S. Revathy pay tribute to a dedicated educator, scholar and researcher.
Educational institutions require keen teachers, especially in the study of Sanskrit polemical works. The students of Sanskrit at the University of Madras were fortunate to have witnessed a rare combination of scholarship and flair for teaching in the late Professor Dr. S. Revathy (1959-2014), who was noted for her in-depth knowledge of Advaita Vedanta and Navya-Nyaya.
Armed with a Bachelor's Degree in Sanskrit from Queen Mary's College, Chennai, she completed her Masters Degree, M.Phil, and Ph.D from Madras University. An outstanding student and research scholar, Dr. Revathi's dream to popularise Sanskrit came true when she was appointed a lecturer in the Sanskrit Department of the Madras University, wherein she served for 27 years - as lecturer from 1987 to 1995, as Reader from 1995 to 2003 and as Professor of Sanskrit from 2003 onwards.
Hailing from a Vaishnavite family, she believed that religion and philosophy are twin branches of the same tree. In an illustrious teaching career spanning over two decades, she had presented over 100 papers at national and international seminars, published over 50 research articles, four books and a monograph. Some of her well known, published titles include ?Three Little Known Advaitins? (Doctoral Thesis), A critical edition of Bhagavad Gita with commentary Padayojana by Ramachandendra, A critical edition of Upadesa Sahasri of Sankaracarya with commentary Padayojanika by Rama Tirtha, and a monograph titled, ?Manamala of Acyutakrishnandatirtha.? She co-authored the text Vedanta Samgraha of Ramaraya Kavi along with Professor Dr. R. Balasubramanian and this was published in 2012. Her research articles covered some rare topics such as Criticism of Buddhism by Mimamsaka, Review of Purvamimamsa doctrines by Jayanta Bhatta.
She always remembered with humility, her guru, Professor Dr. N. Veezhinathan, and followed in his footsteps as a committed teacher eager to continue his legacy. She was sought after by other scholars to exchange or present her views and knowledge, to review and evaluate research works in the field of Nyaya, Advaita, music, dance, sculpture, philosophy, pure language. Fluent in Sanskrit, English, Tamil and Telugu, and with a Siromani degree in Advaita, under her able guidance, 17 students were awarded Doctorate Degrees in Sanskrit.
A multi-talented person, she was ever willing to devote extra time to help her students and took on the role of friend, philosopher and guide. The number of Sanskrit books in her collection was a testimony to her thirst for knowledge. She set high standards in learning and teaching, and continued to delve deep into the language -thanks to the unwavering support she received from her husband, Mr. Sukumar, and two sons.
Her outstanding contribution to Sanskrit research and teaching was recognised through the 'Ram Krishna Sanskrit Award' in 2002 from Saraswati Visvas, Canada, followed by 'Krishna Tatacharya Endowment Award' in 2003, Bangalore. Nominated by the Ministry of Human Resources Development, Government of India, she attended the 14th World Sanskrit Conference at Kyoto University, Japan in 2009. In 2010, she received the 'Certificate of Appreciation' for exemplary contribution to society and preserving India?s cultural and spiritual heritage from Sringeri Jagadguru Sri Sri Bharati Theertha Mahaswamigal Sacred 60th Birth Year Celebrations Committee, Chennai. The University of Madras awarded her the 'Academic Achievement' award in 2012.
The sudden and untimely demise of Dr. S. Revathy on February 5, is a great loss to scholars of Sanskrit and scores of students, who had the opportunity to listen to her deep, resonating voice expounding the subtleties of Advaita and Nyaya philosophy. Her admirers and well wishers will always remember her as one whose every breath spelt Sanskrit.

[INDOLOGY] Yas?odhara's Jayaman?gala? commentary on the

Dear All,
I will be very much thankful if someone could kindly either send me or direct me to a PDF copy of Yas?odhara's Jayaman?gala? commentary on the Ka?masu?tra. The English and German translations of the Ka?masu?tra, already available as PDFs, do contain the Jayaman?gala? too but I am after the Sanskrit original. We do have a hard copy of it (Devadatta S?a?stri?'s edition published in 1964) at Oxford but I wonder if anybody has got a handy scanned version of it, by any chance.
Thank you very much in advance.
Best Wishes,

Proving again how amazing this forum is, Andrew Ollett was very kind to send me an edition published in 1900, which I just a while ago put it on Archive.org for everybody's benefit.

I would also like to thank Profs. McComas Taylor and Kenneth Zysk for their kindest support.

Re: [INDOLOGY] Alchemy metaphor
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
Dear Matthew,
I agree with what you say as far as the difficulties involved in taking vedhaniiya as an optative/potential *passive* participle, meaning 'one to be pierced', are concerned. However, taking vidh/vyadh in the sense 'transform' is not the only solution for the difficulties.
Recognizing that some derivates formed with aniiya can also have a case meaning other than karman, 'direct object', implicit in them also offers a way out. This is what Praj??kara-mati has done. He reads an agentive or instrumental case in the participial adjective. In this understanding, he has support of Paa.nini 3.3.113 (k.rtya-lyu.to;s ca bahulam). This A.s.taadhyaayii suutra recognizes usages like snaaniiya.m cuur.nam 'a powder that brings about bath -- that contributes to the realization of the act of bathing' and daaniiyo                   'A brahmin conducive to giving -- a brahmin who deserves a gift, who motivates people (through his noble conduct, learning, etc.) to give a gift'. (Obviously, the powder is not bathed, and a/the brahmin does not himself become a gift). Relying on such a recognized usages,  Praj??kara-mati advises his readers to take vedhaniiya in the sense 'one which pierces/penetrates' or 'one which is instrumental in the act of piercing/penetrating
'.
Accompanied by atiiva, a word meaning 'that which pierces/penetrates' can be rendered in the present context as 'infusing, permeating', but to take vedhaniiya beyond that sense we still do not have philological support. It can stand for something that leads to transforming but not for transforming itself. A factual follow-up does not necessarily lead to a semantic follow-up. Nor is a logically necessary development always reflected in the semantic extension of a word.
I agree with you that the main proposition in the Bodhi-caryaavataara verse is "just as the rasaj?ta turns a base substance into gold, so the bodhi-citta turns this impure human body into the a buddha-body." I also agree with your surmise contained in: "?apt to infuse?...Praj??kara-mati is indicating something like this when he says: kartari an?ya? kara?e v?." What I question is the assertion in: " [Praj??kara-mati] is interpreting vedh- causatively here".
Even if Praj??kara-mati is understood as you say, the rendering would be 'ras?j?ta is that which causes [X'} to peirce/penetrate/infuse'. Would that necessarily lead to 'ras?j?ta is that which transforms'?
(Your sentence "ras?j?ta is that which brings about infusion ...", probably written to clarify the causativity aspect, does not contain any typical causativity-indicating words. If, for that reason, I understand you as not having technical-grammatical causativity in mind, then I can replace your sentence first with "ras?j?ta is that which causes infusion" and then with "ras?j?ta is that which makes/gives rise to infusion". But then your proposal for overcoming the difficulties will be the same as Praj??kara-mati's.)
Since I have to leave the study of Tibetan to my next life, I cannot comment on the literal meaning of the Tibetan trasnslation you have kindly cited, but I am tempted to ask, "Can the Tibetan not be understood in any way other than 'It is the finest transformer because it causes very great transformation'." Praj??kara-mati's use of vedha-kaaritvaat leaves no doubt that he takes the agent or instrument of the action denoted by vidh/vyadh as the implicit case relationship in  vedhaniiya. The translators, whether guided by Sumati-k?rti or not, are unlikely to have missed the usefulness of the learned hint dropped by  Praj??kara-mati.
Although -kaarin can perhaps be related to the causal derivate kaar of k.r/kar, it does not have a causative sense of the grammatical-technical type 'one which makes/inspires/impels X to perform/undergo some action.'. See compounds ending in -kaarin in the reverse dictionary of W. Schwarz, p. 515.)
You write at the end: "I have a vague recollection, by the way, of discussing this with David Pingree back in the 80s, and he pointed me to an old, but interesting monograph on Indian chemistry (not alchemy) that had some interesting things to say about vedh-. I?ll try to locate the reference ..."
Was the book History of Hindu Chemistry  by Prafulla Chandra Ray? If it was, it is said to have been incorporated in:
Ray, Priyadaranjan. 1956. History of Chemistry in Ancient and Medieval India, Calcutta: Indian Chemical Society. Other title: Chemistry in Ancient and Medieval India.
Thanks and best wishes.

It is amusing that the edition was printed with this caveat on the title page: For Private Circulation Only.  ???????? ???????? ?
Being in Sanskrit isn't prophylaxis against titillation?  It is not even illustrated!
Well now that it's on Archive, it'll turn up on all the XXX sites.
