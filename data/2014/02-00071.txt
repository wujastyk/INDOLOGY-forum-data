[INDOLOGY] language identification (Adam Bowles) > fake languages in literature, Indian and otherwise
Just for fun, it might be amusing to study and compare such examples of 
bogus (?) languages in various literatures. For India, an interesting 
example is the speech of an Indian shipwrecked sailor in a Greek play 
found among the Oxyrhynchus papyri. Hultzsch (Hermes 39, 1904, pp. 
307-311 and JRAS 1904, pp. 309-345) tried to identify it as 
proto-Kannada, but L.D. Barnett (Journal of Egyptian Archaeology 12, 
1926, pp. 13-15) doubted this, and thought that "it might be mere 
gibberish."
In English, Shakespeare's All's Well that Ends Well' contains a scene 
(act IV, scene 1) in which the character speak a mysterious language in 
order to trick the villain Parolles into a confession. The language 
sounds suspiciously like Italian and/or Latin:
First Soldier
     Boskos vauvado: I understand thee, and can speak
     thy tongue. Kerely bonto, sir, betake thee to thy
     faith, for seventeen poniards are at thy bosom.
PAROLLES
     O!
First Soldier
     O, pray, pray, pray! Manka revania dulche
Second Lord
     Oscorbidulchos volivorco.
But here the language is intentionally fake, so it is a different case 
from the one under discussion. There must be many more examples of both 
types, if anyone wants to waste some time...
