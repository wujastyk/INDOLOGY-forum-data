[INDOLOGY] Mein Kampf in India
Dear friends,
I apologize for having raised the subject. My point was not to enter into another
round of discussion of philo-nazi sentiments in India. I wished only to emphasize the
arbitrariness of the censorship that was imposed on our colleague Wendy Doniger
by a narrow and not representative Hindu faction, when,
as we know, genuine hate-literature circulates quite freely in India.
