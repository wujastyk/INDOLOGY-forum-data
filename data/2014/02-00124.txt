[INDOLOGY] Grammatical Pun Reference
Hello Jennifer,
     I looked up the verse and its commentary (Bodhas?ra of Narahari,
Banaras Sanskrit Series, edn, p. 63).  It appears to me that referring
Gurus who replace mamat? with samat?, the verse is poetically calling the
Gurus the best of Grammarians.  The verse is using the grammatical trope of
instituting a replacement (?de?a) in the place of (sth?na) something.  The
process of replacement effectively removes the original and brings into
existence the replacement.  Pata?jali defines the original (sth?nin) as ya?
bh?tv? na bhavati, and ?de?a "replacement" as ya? abh?tv? bhavati.
 Narahari's verse is not referring to any actual grammatical rule that
replaces "ma" with "sa", but is simply referring to the idea of replacement
in the grammar.  At least that is what it seems to be.
