[INDOLOGY] GRETIL update #445: revised versions of some Pali files recently uploaded
GRETIL users please note that in the "plain text versions" of the PTS files uploaded between July 10 and September 2, 2014, a considerable number of blanks/spaces between words were deleted due to an issue in the routine for removing the footnote numbers. (The corresponding files "in original PTS layout" are not affected.)
The problem has meanwhile been fixed, and all files affected have been replaced today (16:00 CEST).
Please download these files again, either individually or collectively in the zip archive file provided for the respective encoding:

Apologies for the inconvenience.
