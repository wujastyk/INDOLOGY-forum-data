[INDOLOGY] Interview with the new ICHR Chairman
Your work sounds interesting.
Some contemporary sat-sangas seem to be oblivious to scholarly issues, including historicity, with members claiming for themselves very generous powers of interpretation. Other groups seem more rigorous.
I might suggest that you classify these sat-sanga groups in terms of their focus on, and attitude toward:
	a. insighter insights, whether scholarly, mystical, or whatever;
	b. ?outsider? academic scholarship 
	c. synthetic approaches combining insider insight and academic rigor.
Best,
Howard.
