[INDOLOGY] Query
Dear List,
I am looking for information about the life of the Tibetan monk Sumpa
Khan-Po Yece Pal Jor (18th century). I am aware of his work edited by Sarat
Chandra Das. But I would appreciate if some one helps me with more
material. More specifically I want to know whether he travelled to India---
S C Das doesn't say anything about this.
Thanks and Regards,
