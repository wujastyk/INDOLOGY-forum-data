[INDOLOGY] Traditional/ insider's view of	language	or	dialect	status of Prakrits
2014-12-27
Dear All:
The "prakrit" of Gandhara (the Kushans) had an army, but maybe not a navy.Language periodization may be an important consideration.The problem of language and dialect may reside in the terminology itself.I should stop here.

As Max Weinreich elegantly put it: "A language is a dialect with an army and navy."
