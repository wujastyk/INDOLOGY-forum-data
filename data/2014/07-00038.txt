You may be interested to compare Bodhicary?vat?ra 1.10, which uses a similar metaphor.
In this case, in the line
rasaj?tam at?va vedhan?yam,

vedhan?yam must mean something like "catalytic."

The Tibetan in this case paraphrases, saying "the finest form of the gold-transmuting essence"
(gser 'gyur rtsi yi rnam pa) and the available Skt. commentator, Praj??karamati, is not very helpful.
In his gloss on vedhan?yam he writes  only:
kartari an?ya.h kara.ne v?
