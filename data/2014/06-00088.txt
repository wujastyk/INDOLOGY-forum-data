Message-ID: <8115AB13-577E-4E73-B929-C8C202D06CD3@earthlink.net>

It?s been many hours since my last posting and it has not been distributed to the list, it seems.  

Anyway, kindly accept the reposting with some additional information.

There are quite a few sea navigational terms found in early Tamil literature, for example, kalam (?kalam'), vangam (?va?kam'), naavaay (?n?v?y'), naavi (?n?vi), miiyaan (m?iy??), niikaan (n?k??), miikaaman (m?k?ma?) in later Tamil, and a few alternatives. It?s a challenge for a translator to bring out the nuance in the translation of these individual terms; almost every term gets translated as ?ship.' miiyaan (m?iy??), niikaan (n?k??), miikaaman (m?k?ma?) are terms referring to the navigator. 

In any case, I?d urge interested scholars to look into the Tamil epic Manimekalai where ship wrecks are detailed. 

Regards,
Rajam

Whether people would take it for granted or would discard it as a story full of myths ? what we read in this text cannot be ignored. If the stories in the Mahabharata and Ramayana are to be believed ? the stories found in the Tamil epic Manimekalai ought to be believed as well, I think.

>>> May I ask you one question about the prohibition of sea travel in ancient and medieval India. As I know, it was only in Baudhayana and some minor dharmasastras. In Manu the navigator was not to be invited for sraddha, and that is all. As I understand, this was no obstacle for Hindus to navigate from Aden to China. The prohibition, if any, concerned Brahmans only. Am I right? If so, whence the overwhelming ostracizing of the sea travelers in the nineteenth century? While Banyas in the sixteenth century actively traded everywhere the future Mahatma was expelled from his caste for going to England!

>>> Is there any history of the Kala pani concept (in the sense of not the Andaman jail but the mysterious ?sea border? that was prohibited to cross?) What was it ? a folkloric notion? How did it gain such popularity, and even with the educated elites in colonial times? Or maybe it was an Orientalist invention disseminated by colonial education?
