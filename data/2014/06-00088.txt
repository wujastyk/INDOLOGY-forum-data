[INDOLOGY] sea travel
It?s been many hours since my last posting and it has not been distributed to the list, it seems.  
Anyway, kindly accept the reposting with some additional information.
There are quite a few sea navigational terms found in early Tamil literature, for example, kalam (?kalam'), vangam (?va?kam'), naavaay (?n?v?y'), naavi (?n?vi), miiyaan (m?iy??), niikaan (n?k??), miikaaman (m?k?ma?) in later Tamil, and a few alternatives. It?s a challenge for a translator to bring out the nuance in the translation of these individual terms; almost every term gets translated as ?ship.' miiyaan (m?iy??), niikaan (n?k??), miikaaman (m?k?ma?) are terms referring to the navigator. 
In any case, I?d urge interested scholars to look into the Tamil epic Manimekalai where ship wrecks are detailed. 
Regards,
Rajam
