 While I think this is a good idea -- lofting the Sta?l-Holstein volumes for curated storage -- as I mentioned to Michael Hahn (offlist), I did not produce these PDFs myself, and in preparation to upload them, noticed that they are the result of scanning a mediocre photocopy, resulting in some flaws in the first couple of pages of each volume. Consequently, I would feel a certain obligation to fix the first few pages of each volume so that the most accurate version is available to people prior to uploading copies for wide-spread distribution.  
   Since Columbia University Library has copies of both books, I will try to do this later in the week and post something the list afterwards once it is done.
All the best,
Paul Hackett
