[INDOLOGY] sad day
Dear colleagues,
The appropriateness or otherwise of my rethorical devices is entirely beyond the original point, and hardly a subject of indological interest.
Nitpicking over details is also in itself a well-known rhetorical device to deflect attention from the main argument.
For these reasons, I will respond off-list to this and other similar comments.

It is a sad day when a member of this list chooses to insult the
totality of his Canadian and US colleagues with an ethnic/national

one has to remind oneself of the many acts of kindness, generosity, and
collegial sharing of information and resources across cyberspace to
refrain from hitting the "unsubscribe" option. May the best in us
continue to prevail!
