Dear Colleagues and Friends,
Professor Radhavallabh Tripathiji has shared with us some thoughts in  
memory of Professor Michael Hahn who passed away on 12th July 2014.  
Those of us who have known him will certainly appreciate them. I am  
happy that Professor Tripathiji gives Vi-D? the opportunity to keep  
this obituary on record.
Members of the IASS already have already seen this, so apologies for  
the repetition.
With best wishes,
Jay Soni
Secretary General  of the IASS
