[INDOLOGY] In search of three plates from Calcutta Review,	Vol. XI (1849)
Dear list,
I am trying to obtain a copy of the three plates attached to the 
following article:
Shome, Baboo Bipin Behari (1849) "Physical Errors of Hinduism" in 
Calcutta Review, Vol. XI, pp. 397-444.
The plates are attached as follows:
Pl. I: Btw. pages 422 & 423
Pl. II: Btw. pages 440 & 441
Pl. III: Btw. pages 438 & 439
The plates are missing from the DLI scan, and in the Google Books scan 
they have not been unfolded before being scanned. See, for example, 
plate I:
http://books.google.dk/books?id=V50bAQAAIAAJ&hl=da&pg=PA422-IA1#v=onepage&q&f=false
(Plate I is especially interesting since the author apparently did not 
recognize it is a gyan chaupar gameboard, but simply treated it as a 
cosmological drawing of the Mount Meru world system - which it, of 
course, also is.)
If anyone has access to the plates in full, and would be so kind as to 
supply me with a full scan of them, I would be most grateful.
Kind regards,
Jacob
