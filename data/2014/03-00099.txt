[INDOLOGY] Rgveda transl. vol.II and EJVS 20
Dear All,  a few announcements:
(1) Vol.II of the ongoing translation of the ?gveda into German has been released in December. (I have finally received my copies. Here it is):
Rig-Veda. Das helige Wissen.   Dritter bis f?nfter Liederkreis.
tr. and comm. by: 
Michael Witzel, Toshifumi Got?, Salvatore Scarlata.
Berlin:  Verlag der Weltreligionen 2013
[pp.344 tr., pp. 345-708 comm., glossary, etc.]
BTW, we had sent in our transl. and commentary in the Summer of 2009 (!) but due to the move of the publisher to Berlin and other re-organizations it has taken until now ? Vol. III and IV will now  follow in due course.
(2)  Also, please note that the last issue of  EJVS, Vol. 20, has been published late in 2013:
Vol. 20 (2013) Issue 4
