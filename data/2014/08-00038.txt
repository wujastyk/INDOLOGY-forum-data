Dear Dr. Mokashi,
I have the pdf of the Kunha edition of Sahy?drikha??a at home.  Currently I am away from home till August 25.  If you cannot find any edition by then, you can contact me again.  At the same time, if you receive a pdf of the Gaytonde edition from someone, please forward that pdf to me.  Thanks.

Madhav Deshpande

Dear Dr. Walser,

"-tv?" is perfectly grammatical and standard, while "-tva" isn't (must be a
typo. Most PTS editions were made on a basis of only a few MSS.) See
Geiger's "A P?li grammar", ?? 209-210.

With best regards,
Gleb Sharygin

It is said that Indra killed his father-in-law Puloman. Could anyone kindly explain the circumstances of that slaying? Thanks!

Dear Gleb,

While hitv? is standard P?li, in this verse hitva is m.c. for hitv?, as pointed out by Norman (2006: 391) in his translation and study of Sn (?The Group of Discourses?). Based on the critical apparatus of the PTS edition, it appears that hitva was the reading found in the editors' Sinhala script manuscript witnesses, while hitv? was the reading found in their Burmese script manuscript witnesses. Neither reading is erroneous.

I?d be grateful for some elucidation on the following from list members
knowledgeable about royal dynasties in medieval India, particularly the
northwest:

In his Daivaj??la?k?ti (1336 CE), the author Teja?si?ha, apparently of
Gujarat and belonging to a family of (former?) royal ministers
(mantrin), extols the Pr?gv??a dynasty (va??a) in general and speaks
particularly of a certain Vikrama, apparently standing in some sort of
feudatory relationship to ?the glorious King ??ra?gadeva, whose fame had
become the head-ornament of the kings born in the illustrious C?lukya
dynasty? (sph?rjac-c?lukya-va??odbhava-n?pati-?irobh??a??-bh?ta-k?rte?
?r?mac-ch?ra?gadev?hvaya-puru?apate??). My questions are:

1. I had understood the C?lukyas and Caulukyas to be two different
dynasties, the C?lukyas being earlier and primarily ruling in the South,
whereas the Caulukyas ruled in the northwest. Is there any way that
?C?lukya? could be anything other than a scribal error here? (I have
access only to a single MS of the text, but Pingree?s CESS [A3 89],
based on a different MS, gives the same reading, without comment.)

2. Teja?si?ha doesn?t quite call ??ra?gadeva a C?lukya/Caulukya, but
almost. I?m assuming that this is the Vaghela king ??ra?gadeva, which
would fit the time frame. Are the Vaghelas typically (or at least
sometimes) considered C?lukyas/Caulukyas?

3. Is the Vikrama associated with ??ra?gadeva known from any other sources?

As always, many thanks in advance for any help!

Martin Gansten
