[INDOLOGY] Jagadish Chandra Chatterjee!
Dear Dr. Mrinal
Kaul (and to all list members)
I tried a lot to
find out personal information about Jagadish Chandra Chatterjee, but has not
succeeded till now. But I got, with the help of an acquaintance the following
books in pdf.
I shall write to
you at the moment I get information about him.
[Ref. Jagadish Chandra Chatterjee:           Ref. Mrinal Kaul?s letter:
I am interested in knowing and exploring more
about Jagadish Chandra Chatterjee who was the first director of the Jammu and
Kashmir Research and Publication Department. He was the first editor of the
famous 'Kashmir Series of Texts and Studies' and edited seven volumes in this
series from 1911 to 1916 including his famous book 'Kashmir ?haivism'. I have
been trying to find more information about him, but have had no success so far.
