[INDOLOGY] The place of Indology in the Academy
Just to add a footnote to Patrick's message, I agree with him that "So, it
is safer to have a broader and larger home in which factors such as student
enrollments can be better managed to satisfy the number crunchers."  In my
own Department of Asian Languages and Cultures at the University of
Michigan, the large enrollments in courses like Introduction to Buddhism
and Tibetan Buddhism (sometimes touching 300 students) help raise the
average enrollments for the whole department, and allow us to teach some
classes with smaller enrollments.  But there is also a question of
different levels of external funding available for different areas within
Asian Studies.  The areas of China, Japan and Korea almost always have
greater external financial sources than the areas of India or South East
Asia.  Within South Asian Studies, there are more external funding
resources available for studies of modern South Asia, rather than those of
classical South Asia.  That is a general pattern that I have observed over
the years.
