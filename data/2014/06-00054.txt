[INDOLOGY] Sanskrit cardinal numerals
Dear colleagues,
I would be most grateful to receive any pointers to any description of
the cardinal numerals of Classical Sanskrit which is more complete
than what there is either in the descriptive grammars of Renou and of
Kale or in the teaching grammars of Mauer and of Aklujkar.
I also wish to know of any treatment of the morphological analysis,
either synchronic, including Paninian, or diachronic of the terms for
the positive integers 11 through 12 and 20, 30, ..., to 90.
Thanks in advance for any assistance.
