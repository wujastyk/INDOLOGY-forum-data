Thanks to both colleagues for clearing up this small bibliographic mystery.
Somewhere someone must have compiled a list of the longest period of time
an article has remained 'forthcoming' of 'in the press'--one hears over the
years various tales of works appearing decades after the death of many
contributors, but I've not yet seen an actual compilation (which,
considering the virtually innumerable ridiculous lists on the internet,
might be a project less weird than some which actually exist!).
With thanks, jonathan
