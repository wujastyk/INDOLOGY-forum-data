Dear? Mr Das,
I? already? read? the Sankarabhasya? on the Isavasyopanisad? and its English translation by swami Gambhirananda?? [Ramakrisna? Mission].My problem is? that what the? following mantra means :
Andham tamah? pravisanti ye? asambhutim upasate.
Tato? bhuya? iva? te tamoya u sambhutyam? ratah //ISA-12//
Swami ji? translates? the view? of Sankara and writes :
Those who worship the unmanifested(prakriti) enter into blinding? darkness;? but? those who are devoted to the manifested (hiranyagarbha)? enter into? greater darkness.
Here the problem? arises? :
1,what is the import of? the worship of asambhuti-avyakrita [ unmanifest]? prakriti ??and? sambhuti-???? karyabrahma[ hiranyagarbha ].Hiranyagarbha is mentioned in hiranygarbha Sukta? too where it means? a huge form?? of paramatma as? 
Hiranyagarbhah samavartataagre bhutasya jaatah patir eka aasit.
.In ?this way? hiranyagarbha? has two?? meanings. what??? import should be taken here as authentic?.
2.what is the system of said worships? of? avyakrita prakriti and? sambhuti ?
In haste I could not use diacritics.

Dr.Jha.
To begin with  we must know the definition of Sambhuti and Asumbhati. Asumbhati implies KARANA( the causal element) OR Prakriti,wheras Sambhuti implies KARYA. Since it's KARYA ,it is liable to be creation/production or dissolution/destruction. 
Thus according to  this  mantra  from Isa Upanishad --
If a person worships or adores asumbhati he would be entering into the darkness(i.e Andham Tama Prabishabti) of ignorance.
If a person worships or adores Sambhuti he would be entering into even more( i.e Tatu bhuo eba te tama) darkness of ignornace.
In fact this sloka implies te difference in approach betwee Karya and Karana. Too much reliance on Karya ( the other name of Vidya or Upasana of Gods)  would lead to a more disastrous consequence than Karana or asumbhati, the worship of which leads us to a state of relative Moksha.( whereas worship of Sambhuti can at best help us overcome death.) This is reflectied in the very next sloka of Isa Upanishad, which says---
Vinashen Mrityum Tirtya AsunbhatimAmrtyamUshnate.
This word Vinashen  implies Karya i.e  Sambhuti.
Thanking You,                                       ALAKENDU DAS.
