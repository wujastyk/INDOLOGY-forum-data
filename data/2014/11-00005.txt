[INDOLOGY] Citalebhatta Prakarana (Bombay, 1926) by RS Pimputkar
Hello Samuel,
     I have located my print copy of the Chitalebhatta Prakarana.  This is
a photocopy of the original at the library of the Bhandarkar Oriental
Research Institute in Pune.  In the next few days, I will see if I can make
a scanned pdf from my photocopy.  Best,
Madhav Deshpande
