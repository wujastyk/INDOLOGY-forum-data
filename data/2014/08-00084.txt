Subject: [INDOLOGY] Request for a page from the Siddhantabindu	(Acyutagranthamala edition)
Message-ID: <CAHuz+CqgxXzGWyxQDE=MYNMJ7H7=LLcwUqgRu0i5z4SAUO-6RA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list members,

If any body has the Acyutagranthamala edition (edited by Srikrishna
Pant,1932) of the Siddhantabindu and could send me a scan copy for page
no.198 (the pdf that I have downloaded does not have this page), I would be
grateful.

Sincerely yours,
Niranjan Saha
