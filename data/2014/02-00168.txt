There is an interesting example in Sanskrit grammar using the expression
k?r??a? agnir adhy?payati "Fire made with [dry cakes of] cow dung helps one
study."  This probably refers to cold days when there was need for heat.  I
wonder if offerings of such cakes allowed the Caitya-dwellers to collect
fuel.
