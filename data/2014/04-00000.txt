[INDOLOGY] Prof. Helmut Krasser
The news of Helmut Krasser?s death, while not a surprise, greatly saddens me. I remember him well from winter and spring of 1985 as ?der kleine Helmut?, an engaging and engaged student. He then was Ernst Steinkellner?s most promising student. I admired the quickness of his wit and memory and the generosity of his spirit.  Over the years I have read with interest a selection of his scholarly contributions. I have profited from insights and interpretations in his published works.
Auf Wiederschauen, Helmut.
