I had no desire to enter into the controversy. I am now in the dialogue
because the NCERT has been brought in. The question may be answered without
holding any brief for any of the parties involved in the first dispute.

The NCERT has no axe to grind. On history or allied matter its object is
India or its components. A community may be the object of description but
without a motive.   Its objective dispassionate approach acts like a
shield.

Doniger's approach is different. Hindus but no Hinduism, and the cart of
'alternative history' has been put before the horse of 'induction'. Why not
Hinduism if it is an academic approach? It is exceptional to find
community-centric motivated approach in an NCERT book. In case of any such
occurrence they are rectified.

I just pointed to the vulnerability of book without taking side.
