I am not sure about the reliablility of the edition.
This edition doesn't have commentary on the seventh chapter i.e.
aupaniSadikam.
It was recently reprinted by Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthana - which has 7th
chapter commentary also.
But taking the fact that RSS chose this edition for reprint - it means that
this would have been one of the best available around.
As far as pictorial depiction is concerned, I read once in a Descriptibe
catalogue that Sarfoji library of Tanjavur has a book on kAmazAstra which
has pictorial depiction of all positions etc. Still I have not been able to
contact the library.
