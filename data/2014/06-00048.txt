[INDOLOGY] Gemology in S. Asia?
I'm sorry that I seem to have missed the first message (sometimes Indology
mails get sent to my spam folder...). Anyway, a quick search for a book I
remembered found what is apparently a book dealers reference (?), which is
nice because of the brief summarY:
*FINOT, Louis.** (1864 - 1935)*
(*Born:* 1864; *Died:* 1935) *French oriental scholar.*
Educated in Paris, Finot came onto the staff of the Bibliotheque Nationale
in 1890. He specialized in the study of Indian languages, archeology,
ethnology. In 1917 he became the Director of Studies at the ?cole Pratique
des Hautes ?tudes.

Very scarce. This is a study of ancient Indian lapidaries reproduced in
Sanskrit together with copiously annotated parallel translations in French.
The lengthy introduction provides a history of lapidary tradition in
ancient India and compares the various works against each other. This is
followed by the reproduction and translations of the ancent texts:
*Ratnapariks?* of Buddhabhatta, *Brhatsamhit?* of Var?hamihira, *Agastimata*
, *Navaratnapariks?*,*Agastiy? Ratnapariks?*, *Ratnasamgraha*,
*Laghu-Ratnapariks?*, and the *Manim?h?tmya*. Many pages of textual notes
and comprehensive indexes conclude the book.
