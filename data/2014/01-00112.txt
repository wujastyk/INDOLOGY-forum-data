Dear colleagues,

I wonder whether two very rare books could be made accessible to me (and
others, of course) by way of scans:

Sta?l-Holstein, Baron A. von 1926. The Kasyapaparivarta - A
Mahayanasutra of the Ratnakuta Class in the Original Sanskrit, in
Tibetan and in Chinese. Shanghai: Commercial Press.

----- 	1933. A Commentary to the Kasyapaparivarta Edited in Tibetan and
in Chinese. Peking: Joint Publication of the National Library of Peking
and the National Tsinghua University.

They don't seem to be available at the usual places.

Thanks in advance.

Michael Hahn
