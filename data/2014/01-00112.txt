[INDOLOGY] Kasyapaparivarta
Dear colleagues,
I wonder whether two very rare books could be made accessible to me (and
others, of course) by way of scans:
Sta?l-Holstein, Baron A. von 1926. The Kasyapaparivarta - A
Mahayanasutra of the Ratnakuta Class in the Original Sanskrit, in
Tibetan and in Chinese. Shanghai: Commercial Press.
in Chinese. Peking: Joint Publication of the National Library of Peking
and the National Tsinghua University.
They don't seem to be available at the usual places.
Thanks in advance.
