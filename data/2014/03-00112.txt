Dear list,
I am looking for any biographical information - or suggestions on where 
to find the same - for the jyotirvid Harik???a who completed his 
"B?hajjyoti??r?ava" in 1871.
So far, all I have is the following bit of information from Gudrun 
B?hnemann's "Ma??ala's and Yantras in the Hindu Tradition" (BRILL, 
2003), p. 74:
"Harik???a's father was Ve?ka?ar?ma, an aud?cya Brahmin of Gujar?t of 
the aud?cya-sahasra branch who resided in Aurangabad. Ve?ka?ar?ma 
belonged to the v?jasaneya-??kh? of the White Yajur-Veda and the 
gautama-gotra."
Any assistance will be much appreciated!
Kind regards,
Jacob
