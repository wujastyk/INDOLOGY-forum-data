[INDOLOGY] Question on Sanskrit Syntax
Thanks to both Dipak and Madhav for continuing this conversation.
P??ini limits the dual behavior of motion verbs (i.e. bh?va or karman marking) to kta (the ta-participle) by 3.4.72; and for kta it is possible to cite Vedic examples of bh?va behavior:
jana? v? etasy?nn?dyam ita? bhavati ? (JB 2.184; sim. ibid. 2.183-184, 235)
The fact that Madhav?s and my examples are post-P?ninian/post-Vedic makes it possible to consider them later innovations, extensions of the syntactic behavior of kta to k?tya and yaK; but given the rarity with which examples like these are attested, it is difficult to be certain of the historical facts.
All the best,
Hans

Thanks! But my intention was not one of clarifying the usage but of drawing attention to the elusive character of the solutions offered. I never got a satisfactory answer to the problems associated with abhidhaana, with due respect, even from Pata;njali.

Dear Dipak,
     Thanks for these clarifying comments.  The syntax of constructions with passive forms of ?ak is very complicated.  Pata?jali's usage of "?akyam (neuter nom) c?nena ?vam??s?dibhir api k?ut (fem nom) pratihantum" in the Mah?bh??ya has generated long debates in the commentaries.  With best wishes,
Madhav

Dear Colleagues,
Perhaps the P??inian assessment of the case is not exactly what has been observed here. According to the P??inian system the k?tya-category suffixes may mean the action or the object (3.4.70). When action is meant by the suffix in prave??avyam it does not affect the object of the active voice which shall retain its second (dvit?y?) case-ending by 2.3.1 and 2.3.2. This explains sabh?m. But when it means the object it becomes an adjective it must have the number, gender etc of the object.
The above means that in the P??inian system the problem of M?dhav which occurs with a finite verb and not with a k?tya-suffix is not solved by the example from Manu. In the sentence cited by Madhav, which has a passive-voice, the object is understood as abhihita (by 3.4.69) and normally its case-ending should be the first one by 2.3.46.
I just put the P??inian point of view without any claim to its theoretical correctness. The basic problems of the P??inian standpoint have been dealt with by me in a recent publication on P??ini with statement of its opponents' standpoints. But I have not yet got a copy of the book.
The problem of accord between the k?tya-ending word and its corresponding noun has often to be faced in Sanskrit. Cf., ?akyam a?jalibhi? p?tu? v?t?? ketakagandhina? R?m., Ki?kindh? 28.8. Here too ?akyam is taken to mean the action.
My best wishes for all for a happy 2015

Of all the explanations I have received, this one seems most convincing, and especially the example from Manu seems like a good parallel.  Thanks, Hans.

Hi, Madhav.
If pr?pyate is construed as a verb of motion (in the sense ?reach?), the structure has precedents; compare the structure below, which shows that with verbs of motion the goal is not always construed as object in post-Vedic. Of course, the parallel with labhate might suggest an interpretation ?obtain?. In that case (i.e., if it is not to be taken as a motion verb), there may be a parallel in late Sanskrit (one of the versions of the Vet?lapa?cavi??ati, perhaps the one edited by Uhle); unfortunately I can?t find the exact reference.
sabh?m v? na prave??avyam (Manu 8.13)
All the best for the New Year,

n a Sanskrit work titled Nity?c?radarpa?a by Brahm?nanda, on p. 2, I see a quotation from Dak?asm?ti:
??????????? ???????????????? ?????: ?
???????????????? ??????????????????????? ????? ??
Here, ?c?r?t pr?pyate svargam is an irregular usage, unless one assumes that the word svarga is somehow used in neuter gender.  With the normal masculine gender of the word svarga, svargam would be an accusative case form, and this does not fit well with the passive verb.  In Marathi, such passive constructions are possible: ?????? (instrumental) ??????? (accusative) ?????? (passive verb).  This usage alternates with a more Sanskrit like passive: ?????? ???? (nom) ??????/????? (nom).  I am wondering if anyone has come across Sanskrit passive (bh?ve) constructions where the object shows up in the accusative case.  Any information or suggestions are appreciated.
