Dear Colleagues,
I would be grateful if someone could help me locating commentaries on
Ga?ge?a?s Tattvacint?ma?i. I am interested in the anum?nakha??a (precisely
the appendix on ??vara), and the commentaries thereon by Rucidatta (ed. K.
Tarkavagisa, Calcutta: 1884-1891) and Raghun?tha ?iroma?i (ed.
Nyayapodhyaya, Varanasi, 1906-1908).
