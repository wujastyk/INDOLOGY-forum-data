[INDOLOGY] Help with abbreviation
I should be most grateful if someone could inform me what the abbreviation BK?S stands for in Willem Bollee's article "Folklore on the foot in pre-modern India" (Indologica Taurinensia, 34 2008). The version of the article that I have does not list the abbreviations.
Many thanks,
Ken
