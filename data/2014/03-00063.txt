[INDOLOGY] Fwd:  (no subject)
Many thanks to everyone for the information! As I confessed at the outset, I don?t know much about these things; and, many traditional scholars (of Sanskrit & Tamil & religion) in South India are not in touch with ?modernism!' So much for our generation gap!
One way to preempt controversy and confusion would be to refer to the source of the art work with acknowledgement. 
Regards,
Rajam
