[INDOLOGY] Lilavati of Bhaskaracary with Vasana
Dear Ajit,
I don't have a copy of that exact edition, but this might be a good opportunity to highlight to this list an amazing collection of downloadable works (some very rare, old, and/or out of print) of Bhaskara II, that the organising team of the Bhaskara 900 international conference at Thane have compiled.  You can view them at:

Many thanks to whomever was responsible for this!
With best wishes,
Clemency
