In his commentary on Pati??uppattu43.19-20, Auvai Turaic?mi Pi??ai highlights the tradition of Tamil kings?patronage of poets and bards like the P??ar continuing even in the12th century CE in the following words.
"????? ??????????????? ???????? ????????  ?????????????  ????????? ?????????????. ???????????? ?????????????????  ????????  ???????????  ?????,  ??????? ???????? ????? ???????? ???????? ????????? ??????? ????????? ???????????   ????   ????  ?????? ????????  ???????  ???????? ???????????  ?????  ?????????  (S.  I. I. Vol. V. No. 645) ???? ??????? ?????? ???????????????? ?????????."
Pi??ai has rendered the relevantportion of the inscriptional text as ?perum pulavarum aru? kavi?arum n?ppu?unallicaip p??arum k??iyarum kuyiluvarum n??u n??u cen?u iravalar?y i?umpai n??kip puravalar?yp puka?pa?aippa??.  This passage occurs as partof the eulogy of Kul?ttu?ka? II (not Kul?ttu?ka? III as Pi??ai hasstated). The actual inscriptional text is shown in the attachment as perumpulavaru maru? kavi?aru n?ppu?u nallicaip p??arum ko?iyarum kuyilavaru n??un??ucen?iravalar?yi?umpai ni?kip puravalar?yp puka? pa?aippa?
One can see that Pi??ai has split thesandhi as iravalar? yi?umpai > iravalar?y + i?umpai, whichsuggests that under the king's rule poets and bards went from place to place assupplicants and got rid of their suffering,which does not really add to the glory of the king. In order to make sensethat fits thespirit of eulogy of the inscription, it seems that the sandhi is better splitas in ?iravalar?ya i?umpai? much like the case of sandhis wediscussed in the Ku?untokai 106 thread. The revision will mean that thepoets and bards were relieved of the suffering of going from place to place bythe king's munificence and they became patrons of others!
(By the way, n?ppu?u seems to bea misreading of narappu?u.)
I appreciate any comments.
Thanks in advance
