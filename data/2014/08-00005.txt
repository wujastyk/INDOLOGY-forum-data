[INDOLOGY] Font with Brahmi characters
I think we need more clear instructions for end users. I downloaded all of those types but got nowhere from there. 
I?m sure, scholars like ?ri Shriramana Sharma <jamadagni at gmail.com> and his colleagues who developed the Tamil Brahmi font would be able to help us here.
Best,
Rajam
