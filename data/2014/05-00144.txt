[INDOLOGY] Vedas: Divisions, Dating and Language
Dear Colleague, You really want! So many students took them to their lands,
nobody spoke anything. So I shelved the matter for works that drew better
response. But provided I get sufficient time to concentrate I shall try to
devise something presentable -- not for the general reader which may be
ridiculous but for individual need. The MLBD controversy took so much time,
I regret that I could not be aloof. Must think of your request seriously
later after offloading a bit.
Thanks and best  wishes
DB
