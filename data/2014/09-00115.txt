[INDOLOGY] Working free for Oxford Bibliographies Online
I wrote two pieces for the OBO ("Karma" and "Vedic Agni").  The work
required was indeed significant; no less than that needed for a major
article.
Free access is hardly asking "too much," and I support your position not to
contribute further revision without at least gaining this token in exchange
for our work.
