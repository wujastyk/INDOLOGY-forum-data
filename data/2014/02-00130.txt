I think the solution to the problem presented by Periya Tirumo?i 8.2.2 is given by Ku?untokai 106 by Kapilar. What I am giving below is the poem based on the critical edition by Eva Wilden but with gemination of consonants shown in pu?arcci.








pul v?? i??ik kal ivar ve? v?r
varai i?i aruviyi? t???um n??a?
t?tu il ne?cattuk ki?avi namvayin
vanta??u v??i t??i n?mum
ney pey t?yi? etirko??u
t?m ma?anta?aiyam e?a vi?ukam t?t?


The translation below is basically Eva Wilden's except that I have changed 'ghee' to 'oil' for ney.


Word has come to us, oh friend,
	from the faultless heart of the man from a land where,
	    like the waterfall descending the mountain,
	appears the stone-climbing white root of the talbot fig
									with low aerial roots,
   After receiving [his words] like fire into which oil is poured,
we too shall send a message saying    
					    'we are still those he united with.'


While ney can mean both oil and ghee, ney pey t? simply refers to a situation of 'adding fuel to the fire' as in the following passage from Arttamu??a Intumatam by Kannadasan, showing the common usage of oil being poured into a fire. 



"???;????? ???? ??????????????, ?????????????? ?????????.
???????? ????? ??????? ???????????? ??? ??? ??????????? ?????????.
 
??? ????? ??????????????????, ???? ???????????????? ??????? ????????????????? ??????????????????."


The notes given by UVS to Ku?untokai 106 show that the commentator I?amp?ra?ar considers the poem to describe a pre-marital situation in which the heroine does not dislike/is not angry at the messenger from the hero. But Nacci??rkki?iyar, another commentator, thinks the poem deals with a situation after marriage. A comment by P?r?ciriyar, another commentator, that receiving 'like fire into which ney is poured', is not possible in a pre-marital situation. May be he associates ney being poured into the fire with the Vedic fire ritual. I do not consider that a likely scenario. In contrast, I?amp?ra?ar's discussion of the poem in Ka?aviyal makes more sense. Wilden is right in translating 'ma?a-' as 'unite' and not as 'marry' as some scholars have done. The waterfall and mountain clearly suggest Ku?i?ci as the landscape, as some scholars have considered. There is nothing in the poem that suggests that there is an 'other woman' in the picture. So I do not agree with T. V. Gopal Iyer's view that this poem belongs to Marutam.


Who is the messenger here? According to Tolk?ppiyam Poru?atik?ram, those who are allowed to speak in poems dealing with pre-marital love include p?rpp?? (brahmin/priest), p??ka? (companion), heroine's friend, heroine's foster mother, hero and heroine. Although the commentary for I?aiya??r Ka?aviyal 3 identifies the companion as a p?rpp??, Nacci??rkki?iyar (commentary for Ka?aviyal 10) only says that the companion is "perump??mai p?rpp???m", i.e., in majority of the instances the companion is a brahmin/priest.  Although poems like Ku?untokai 156 suggest the companion being a brahmin/priest, Na??i?ai 250 and Na??i?ai 370, in both of which, the hero invites the bard to laugh with him, suggest that the companion could have been a bard earlier. Moreover Nacci??rkki?iyar in his commentary on Tol. P. 193 refers to p??a? as p??ku pa??o?ukum p??a? and p??i?i as talaivim???up p??k?yo?ukum p??i?i even as Tol.P. 193 lists p??ka? separately from the bard and his female counterpart. Interestingly, in their commentaries to the s?tra beginning with "ava?a?i v???a", I?amp?ra?ar considers Na??i?ai 90 as spoken to the hero's companion. But Nacci??kki?iyar considers the same poem as spoken to the bard. 


Thus whatever be the view of the later grammarians in classifying the companions as distinct from the bards and that only companions could speak in poems dealing with pre-marital love, the internal evidence from the poems suggest that the bards could have been companions too. If that were accepted then, they could have served as messengers not only after marriage but before marriage too. 


If that were accepted, Periya Tirumo?i 8.2.2, makes eminent sense.  A maiden being in love with the hero (Vi??u), the bard (p??a??r interpreted as religious teacher) acting as a messenger, and the girl being resolute in passion towards Vi??u, all fit the pre-marital love scenario with no 'other woman' being present.  The lack of anger towards the messenger also explains the honorific form, p??a??r.


I would appreciate any comments on this solution.


Thanks in advance.

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Periya Tirumo?i 8.2.2





Even with the understanding that the devotional poems of the Vai??ava saints do not strictly follow the conventions of the Classical Tamil love poetry, the interpretation of Periya Tirumo?i 8.2.2 is perplexing. Here is the verse given in Periya Tirumo?i Ira???m Tokuti (with Periyav?cc?? Pi??ai's commentary translated into Tamil by Ti. V?. K?p?laiyar) produced by EFEO and published by Teyvac C?kki??r Caivacitt?ntap P??ac?lai, Ta?c?v?r, 2006, p. 962.


n?? nil? mu??attu ni??u iva? n?kki???;
k??um?, Ka??apuram! e??u k???i???;
p??a??r ti??am irukka, i?i, iva?
n??um?? na??u na??u Na?aiy?rarkk?!


The verse is supposed to be the utterance of a mother about her daughter in love with Vi??u. The traditional commentary (p. 965) explains 'p?????r' in the verse by relating it to the Classical Tamil Marutam genre in which the bard acts as a messenger from the husband to his wife , who is mad at him for having gone to the other woman. But then it goes on to explain that 'p??a??r' represents the religious teachers, who act to bring the souls toward 'God' and that in the verse the girl is resolute in her faith because of the religious teachers. And the mother concludes that the resolute girl will not be bashful in expressing her love toward Vi??u.  See attachment. 


I am not convinced by the commentary's explanation about the association with Marutam, the resoluteness of the bard, who is referred to in a very respectful way, and the lack of bashfulness of the girl. The respectful way the bard is mentioned suggests more of Mullai.  Won't a better interpretation be that the mother talks about her daughter, a maiden, who sends a message to her beloved through the bard; the bard comes back with the message that the hero will join her soon; emboldened by this certainty, the maiden has no bashfulness in expressing her love; and the mother is critical of the hero for causing this immodest behavior in her daughter? (Of course, many ti?ai conventions are violated here too.)


I would appreciate any comments on this verse and possible interpretations.


Thanks in advance

Palaniappan
