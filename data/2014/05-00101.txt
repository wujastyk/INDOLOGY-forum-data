[INDOLOGY] Hitler and MLBD
There is no debate about the appeal of fascist forms of politics in India
today--this is not a controversial point, and certainly not a matter of
'opinion'. Vastly popular organizations like the RSS, Sangh Parivar, etc.
take their inspiration from Mussolini and Hitler. Savarkar directly
modelled his organization on Mussolini. You might be aware that a PM has
just been elected with intense connections to these organizations.
