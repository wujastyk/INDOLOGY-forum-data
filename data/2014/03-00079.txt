[INDOLOGY] Conference Announcement: Buddhism and Social Justice
dear Friends and Colleagues,
It is my very great pleasure to announce the following conference, which
all are welcome to attend:
 *An International Conference on Buddhism and Social Justice*
23-25 April 2014, Leiden University
 Pavilion building, Museum Volkenkunde,
Steenstraat 1, Leiden
Moving away from a common perception of Buddhism as intrinsically a
tradition of peace and justice, our project?based at Leiden
University?seeks to explore the various ways in which historically Buddhist
societies have shaped, transmitted, and adapted Buddhist ideas and ideals
about equality, fairness, and freedom. We are further interested in how (if
at all) such societies have instantiated these ideas and ideals.
The intent of the conference ?Buddhism and Social Justice? is to gather
scholars to discuss Classical and modern Buddhist notions of justice and
their real world reflexes. We will be most centrally concerned with
Buddhist visions?implicit or explicit?of ideal (just) societies and the
role of human action, as these appear, for instance, in the realms of
freedom and its constraints, social hierarchy and mobility, economic
opportunity, and power and self-determination.
The full text of the initial proposal upon which our project was based, and
other information about our research team, and the conference itself, can
be consulted on this website.
This Call for Papers hasinvited scholars interested in these issues from a
descriptive, rather than prescriptive, point of view to come together and
share their expertise, findings and questions. Papers will deal with many
regions within Asia and any time period.
The interested public is welcome to attend, but we do ask that you register
(free of charge) in order to allow us to plan properly for seats and
catering. Registration emails and questions can be sent to
conference at buddhismandsocialjustice.com
