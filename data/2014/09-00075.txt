Dear All:
For windows (vers XP, Vista, 7, 8, etc.), once the Sanskrit - devanagari codepage is enabled and loaded, the following extra characters and accents can be produced:rt-alt+ lowercase period:?
rt-alt+ uppercase period: ?(avagraha)
rt-alt + semicolon: underscore (vedic anudatta accent) ??
rt-alt + uppercase apostrophe: (vedic svarita accent)??
rt-alt + z:  accent grave ??
rt-alt + c:  accent aigue??
rt-alt + uppercase x: ?
rt-alt + uppercase f : ?
rt-alt + uppercase r: ?
rt-alt + uppercase equal sign: ?
Tx.

P.S.  Does anyone need to know how to load the Sanskrit codepage in windows?

Thanks! Somehow, I find MSW with improvised
shortcuts quite handy. But I thank you for the kind words and the programme!  
By the way, I apprehend some problems.
The nasal sign of a dotted half-circle []
over vowels works in MSW Devnagari but cannot be typed as a standing sign when
typing in Roman. For this the processor Baraha is useful. It is Unicode
compliant and had to be purchased with Credit Card. The rules might have
changed now, I do not know.  
Another way of doing that is to
reverse the dot used with m for anusv?ra. Thus if one is typing ? for anusv?ra,
for the nasal vowel one may type <l?la> and then add in brackets (????).  
Apology for unsolicited advice.
I am eager to know if the figure in Paint came in the mail.
