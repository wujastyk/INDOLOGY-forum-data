Dear Dr. Mokashi,
I have the pdf of the Kunha edition of Sahy?drikha??a at home.  Currently I
am away from home till August 25.  If you cannot find any edition by then,
you can contact me again.  At the same time, if you receive a pdf of the
Gaytonde edition from someone, please forward that pdf to me.  Thanks.

Madhav Deshpande
