It was simply said  "?a?kara's Saundaryalahar?", not "Saundaryalahar? by the the author of the Brahmas?trabh?s?ya".
The fact is that the Saundaryalahar? is ascribed to (one) ?a?kara by the mediaeval scholarly indigenous tradition, which considers that it is the same ?a?kara as the one who composed the Brahmas?trabh?s?ya. See e.g. the Vani Vilas Press edition (under the direction of the Sringeri Matha) of the "complete works" of  ?a?kara https://archive.org/details/CompleteWorksOfSriSankaracharyaIn20Volumes1910Edition
which includes also  for example the "Tantric" Prapa?cas?ra (vol. 19) once edited by A. Avalon.
Now there are the critical studies by Paul Hacker, Hajime Nakamura etc. which have tried to distinguish between the different authorships and to determine which works can be ascribed to the "original" early Advaitin philosopher called ?a?kara.
Nevertheless, would it be really useful or necessary to say something like "pseudo-?a?kara'" for the author(s) of the ?a?karian Hyms? Or to talk here about "ideologically biased ascriptions". I would rather consider that these ascriptions where firstly made, in the course of time, by the different ?a?karian traditions themselves, and in this way are highly significant.
