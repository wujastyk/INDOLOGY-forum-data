It was simply said  "?a?kara's Saundaryalahar?", not "Saundaryalahar? by the the author of the Brahmas?trabh?s?ya".
The fact is that the Saundaryalahar? is ascribed to (one) ?a?kara by the mediaeval scholarly indigenous tradition, which considers that it is the same ?a?kara as the one who composed the Brahmas?trabh?s?ya. See e.g. the Vani Vilas Press edition (under the direction of the Sringeri Matha) of the "complete works" of  ?a?kara https://archive.org/details/CompleteWorksOfSriSankaracharyaIn20Volumes1910Edition
which includes also  for example the "Tantric" Prapa?cas?ra (vol. 19) once edited by A. Avalon.
Now there are the critical studies by Paul Hacker, Hajime Nakamura etc. which have tried to distinguish between the different authorships and to determine which works can be ascribed to the "original" early Advaitin philosopher called ?a?kara.
Nevertheless, would it be really useful or necessary to say something like "pseudo-?a?kara'" for the author(s) of the ?a?karian Hyms? Or to talk here about "ideologically biased ascriptions". I would rather consider that these ascriptions where firstly made, in the course of time, by the different ?a?karian traditions themselves, and in this way are highly significant.

> Dear colleagues,

> The last major work by the late Sir John Tavener, the British composer, was a modern classical setting of ?a?kara's Saundaryalahar?.  It received its premiere on Sunday last, at the Barbican in London.  Sir John worked with W. Norman Brown's text and translation (Harvard, 1958).
> 
> It was broadcast live on radio, and can be heard on BBC Radio 3's website for a few more days: http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04jj824.  (Listeners outside the UK may need a VPN connection to a computer inside the UK.)
> 
> One listener who attended the premiere, said,
> 
> It was indeed an amazing flood, a wash of sound and texture, and indeed text.  In the hall itself, I was rather tense and aware that it might seem quite long, but after it was over, there was a sense that it could easily have been enjoyed for longer, and the radio broadcast is very easy to appreciate.
> 
> The translation of the text (there was so much!) was put on big screens, but I am not sure that really helped - that ancient Sanskrit has a different flavour all together.  Of course that was interesting in itself, but overall, the music was the embodiment (as it were) of the text, so the specific words weren't necessarily needed.
> 
> It was a flood, and it was beautiful.
> 
> Another performance is being planned for Singapore next year.

> Best,
