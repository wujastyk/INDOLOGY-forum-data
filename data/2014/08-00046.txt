Similar problem here, as of yesterday.  Whenever I open a Word doc the keylayout switches to Devanagari. If I remove Dev from the list, it switches to US Extended, which cannot be removed. I normally use a customized version of EasyUnicode. The problem seems limited to Word.

Dear List,

I am having trouble with the factory Hindi and Gujarati fonts on my Macbook Pro. In the middle of typing they just reverted to the Latin font. The Urdu font and phonetic fonts I also work with are fine.

I made sure that caps lock was not on.

I think it may be due the latest update?

I went through keyboard preferences and uninstalled/unclicked both languages but that has not worked.

Has anyone experienced this problem before or currently?


All the best,
