[INDOLOGY] Shashti Devi
Yes, she seems to have been a popular subject in Kalighat painting. Officially it?s supposed to be a black cat, as in this splendid one in the Philadelphia Museum of Art, but often it isn?t: http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/88464.html
I am told that there is a temple of ?Ma Shoshthi? (with cat v?hana) in Kolkata, but I cannot find any pictures or information online. I am probably hampered by my lack of Bengali, as I wouldn?t be able to pick up if e.g. someone blogged about visiting it.
