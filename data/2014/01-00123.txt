[INDOLOGY] fr.Wikipedia and other non sa.wikipedia
One other approach to Wikipedia that I have taken is to use it as part of course assignments in lieu of other kinds of writing.  Most of the "Hindu Law"-related entries in the English Wikipedia were written, edited, and expanded by students in my course of that name.  Wikipedia's good rule against original research functions well in the context of a course, where the goal is often to learn to synthesize existing knowledge about an area.  I won't claim all the pages on this theme are excellent or complete, but at least there is a presence for it in Wikipedia and I can feel that the information presented is at least good enough for my idiosyncratic view of the field.  More controversial subjects would, of course, be more challenging for a course, but I agree with others that contributing to Wikipedia can be valuable for a limited public.

I have occasionally contributed to the Tamil Wikipedia (and to other Wikipedias), although not frequently.
As an example,
the following page
"http://ta.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E0%AE%86%E0%AE%A3%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%9F%E0%AF%81_%E0%AE%B5%E0%AE%9F%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%9F%E0%AE%AE%E0%AF%8D_%E0%AE%85%E0%AE%9F%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%9F%E0%AE%B5%E0%AE%A3%E0%AF%88"
(alias "http://ta.wikipedia.org/s/kk3")
was created by me,
at a time when I was cataloguing old Tamil books which had belonged to the late T.V. Gopal Iyer (1926-2007).
Best wishes
