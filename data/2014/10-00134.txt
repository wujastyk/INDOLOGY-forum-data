[INDOLOGY] Looking for R. Davis: South Asia at Chicago (1985)
Would someone be kind enough to inform me how I can get access to
Richard Davis: South Asia at Chicago : A History.
Chicago : Committe on Southern Asian Studies, 1985
No copy seems to have reached Europe, except one in Leiden (NL), which would probably take some time to procure.
Many thanks in in advance.
