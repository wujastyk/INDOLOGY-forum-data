Message-ID: <2312091415269541@web6j.yandex.ru>


Dear members of the list,
I  need a scan or pdf of the  book The Buddhist Philosophy of Thought: Essays in Interpretation by Alexander Piatigorsky.
 I am preparing a book of his early buddhological papers in Russian and I have to write an introduction with the account of his later works in English.
Warm regards,
Victoria
