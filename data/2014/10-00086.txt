[INDOLOGY] query: roman>devanagari conversion
I have found this one useful and fairly accurate (unlike many others that put in a lot of Viraamas) http://epandit.shrish.in/tools/IAST-DV-IAST/
But the devanaagarii will not be read properly in Word, of course.

Re: [INDOLOGY] query: roman>devanagari conversion
Dear friends,
I would appreciate recommendations for a readily available, efficient and accurate
program to convert unicode Sanskrit romanization to devanagari. (Vedic accents
are not needed.)
with thanks in advance for your suggestions,
