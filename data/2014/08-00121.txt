In the Shadow of the Golden Age:
Art and Identity in

May 2014??
Hardcover ISBN: 978-3-86893-149-5
?
This volume examines and debates the validity and usefulness of the
of the golden age when investigating, structuring and categorising
Islamic art. The book contains contributions from fifteen
international specialists in the visual arts and humanities working
material from a wide range of periods and regions throughout Asia and
Islamic world.
Instead of concentrating on the so-called ?high points?
art, which have so far stood at the centre of
text focuses on visual expressions of
times of change. These challenging but
periods were marked by intense efforts by
identities.
Through their art and frequently
settings they have succeeded in
their religious, cultural or
these less investigated phases
significantly to the discipline.
