[INDOLOGY] Indian reprint
It goes to the credit of MLBD that they worked within the law befitting to
their reputation and goowill. But that cannot be said of dozen other
publishers of Delhi. The most unfortunate aspect is that there is no remedy
excepting bringing lawsuits against the perpetrators of the crime. That is
time consuming and expensive. Often the victim has to give up.
