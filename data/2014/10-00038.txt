[INDOLOGY] PDF of Samkhya-sutra-vrtti?
Dear Colleagues,
I was wondering if any of you had a PDF file of Richard Garbe's
Sanskrit edition of the S??khya-s?tra-v?tti of Aniruddha. It was
originally published in 1888 in Calcutta by the Baptist Mission Press
(Bibliotheca Indica no. 122). If so, would you be willing to share
this file with me? I haven't been able to find it online.
It is listed in WorldCat as:
The S?am?khya su?tra vr?itti; or, Aniruddha's commentary and the
original parts of Veda?ntin Maha?deva's commentary to the Sa?m?khya
su?tras
With thanks in advance,
Andrew
