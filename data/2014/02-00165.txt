Dear list-members,

could anybody help me with the book Ibtida?i Kalam-i-Iqbal  (author: Gyan Chand) ? I would need a piece of information / citation contained in it about the hymn Sare jahan se accha. The book is not to be found in any public library within reach.
Ibtid??? kal?m-i Iqb?l, bah tart?b mah o s?l / Gy?n Cand.
Muhammad Iqbal, Sir, 1877-1938.
?aidar?b?d : Urd? R?sarc Sen?ar ; Dihl? : Taqs?mk?r Ej?keshnal Pablishing H???s, 1988.

Thank you for all troubles,
Ulla Remmer
