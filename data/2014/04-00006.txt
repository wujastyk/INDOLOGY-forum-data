[INDOLOGY] Text and photo sought
Dear Colleagues
Does anyone have access to a text of the N?si?ha Carita (or Caritra), by a poet called Yuga Das or Yuga Das Kondh, said to be an 18th century work concerning the origins of the worship of Bi??la Narasi?ha, the cat-headed form of the avat?ra, at the Nrusinghanath Temple, Baragarh, Orissa? 
I would also be grateful for a good photograph of the main image of this temple, as the only one I have been able to find online is small and unclear (and peeping out from behind a lot of garlands etc).
With thanks -
