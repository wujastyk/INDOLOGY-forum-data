[INDOLOGY] text memorization
Dear Prof. James Hartzell,
I recently stumbled upon this website
https://avagraha.wordpress.com/
with a tagline of
"Memorizing texts in a digitized world"
with pages such as
http://avagraha.wordpress.com/2013/02/16/memorizing-long-rules/
remembered your post.
Wanted to share.
Regards,
Nagaraj
Dear colleagues
Might someone have handy some references on the practice of memorization in
the Sanskrit (and Tibetan) traditions?  I know memorizing texts is a basic
part of, for instance, traditional medical education, jyotishastra, etc.
What I am looking for are good published studies describing these practices
(pdf's would be a bonus).
Cheers,
