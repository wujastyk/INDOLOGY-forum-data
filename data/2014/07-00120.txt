About p?tala (if that's the word), if this is a formation with the -la
suffic (lac) by P??ini 5.2.96-99, then the suffix means the same as
mat(up), i.e.,  "having yellow."  Would this be an author trying to be
precise, meaning that the result of alchemical process "had yellow" rather
than actually *being* yellow?

However, there may be a problem with p?ta-la.  Of words that are not -?
stems meaning a part of the body, the list that can have a -la suffix,
sidhm?di, includes pitta, but not p?ta.   I'm away from my main reference
books: is ???????? an ????????  If not, then P??ini would seem not to allow
the formation p?ta-la.

My more learned vy?kara?a colleagues might be able to clarify this point.

Best,
Dominik
