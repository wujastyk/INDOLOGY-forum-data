[INDOLOGY] File under: good grief, and it really makes you want to cry
dear all
it does not seem any disorder either in Hindu news and comments thereunder.
the comment by learned professor is totally unwarranted
" worse even than the article (and the sad state of the ASI if the article
is to be believed) are the comments (!)"
if somebody doubts the authenticity of 400 kg begging bowl and the use of
that much big bowl by buddha who gave up everything, it is quite natural.
