[INDOLOGY] References on women scholars in ancient and medieval	India
For a discussion of Classical Tamil female poets, see http://www.ulakaththamizh.org/JOTSArticle.aspx?id=69
For a discussion of K?raikk?l Ammaiy?r, the female ?aiva saint-poet, see Elaine Craddock's works listed in her page at http://www.southwestern.edu/departments/faculty/faculty.php?id=craddoce&style=religion
Also, the book by Karen Pechilis http://www.taylorandfrancis.com/books/details/9780415615860/ may be of interest.
On the Vai??ava saint-poet, ?????, see http://www.sunypress.edu/p-956-antal-and-her-path-of-love.aspx as well as
http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780195391756.do
I am sure there are other journal articles dealing with the above devotional saints. But works on Classical Tamil poets are far fewer in English.

[INDOLOGY] References on women scholars in ancient and medieval India
Dear colleagues,
I have been asked by a non indologist colleague for references on women scholars in ancient and medieval India. Do you know of an article or a book which would deal directly with this subject?
I have noted so far for him:
Witzel, Michael. 2009. Female Rishis and philosophers in the
Veda? Journal of South Asia Women Studies 11(1).
http://asiatica.org/jsaws/11-1/female-rishis-and-philosophers-veda/
And 
Mary McGee, Ritual Rights The Gender Implications of Adhikdra in L. Patton ed Jewels of Authority, OUP 2002. 32-50 (esp. p.42)
but this is very meager and vedic...
I can't help but feel that there is a very obvious reference that I must be lacking
thanking you in advance for your help,
Agathe
