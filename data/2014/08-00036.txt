[INDOLOGY] CFP - Krishna and Govardhana Mountain JVS Special Issue	- Reminder
Dear colleagues,
This is just a reminder CFP, first announced in May, for a special issue of the Journal of Vaishnava Studies on the theme of Krishna and Govardhana Mountain. I extend my thanks in advance for forwarding the CFP to those whom you know working on this topic or who might take an interest in the theme. I am particularly keen on drawing in papers which treat the mountain's significance in:
  *       sectarian Vaishnava traditions
  *       renderings in kavya
  *       plastic and performing arts
  *       pilgrimage traditions
  *       ritual practices
  *       treatment in Vaishnava commentarial literature
Papers should be double spaced, roughly 6000-8000 words, inclusive of notes (endnotes please, not footnotes) and references. Please submit in either Word or PDF format, along with a one-paragraph autobio statement. The deadline to submit is November 1st 2014 to christopher.austin at dal.ca.
Thank you very much,
Chris
