[INDOLOGY] Alchemy metaphor
Let me immediately say that I apologize for inadvertently implying that Dr
Torella was confused on a particular point -- in fact the confusion was
mine, and not properly flagged as such.  I am very much aware that my
understanding of Pratyabhij?? materials lags *far* behind Dr. Torella's,
and I have the greatest respect for his work.
best, CW
