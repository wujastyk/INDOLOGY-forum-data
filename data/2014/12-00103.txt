[INDOLOGY] Question on Sanskrit Syntax
In this context, it may be noted that commentators on Manu 8.13 (sabh?? v? na prave??avya? ?) also read sabh? v? na prave??avy?.  Thus Medh?tithi, and Kull?ka remarks medh?tithin? tu sabh? v? na prave??avyeti ?jveva pa?hitam.  Doubtless, the apparatus on this verse in Patrick Olivelle?s critical edition, to which I do not have access at the moment, can contribute here.  George
