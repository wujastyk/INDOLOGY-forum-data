[INDOLOGY] The place of Indology in the Academy
In Germany, there are (still) departments of Indology.  In a sense, such
German departments are conceptually parallel to departments of Classics.
In most universities elsewhere, Indology "lives" somewhere within a larger
unit, such as Religious Studies, Classics, Asian Studies (or Oriental
Studies), Philosophy or History.
Institutionally speaking, where does Indology flourish best?  For what
reasons?
Clearly there are determining issues, perhaps principally, "how many
Indologists are we talking about?"  If there is one Indological faculty
member, she would normally be appointed within History, Philosophy or
Religious Studies, etc.   But if there are three or four faculty members
(not so common?), a critical mass is beginning to form that requires its
own institutional recognition.  What is this critical mass?
The faculty or department with which Indology shares space will also
therefore form the main group of competitors for Indological resources
(faculty positions, library budget, teaching room allocation, etc.).  With
whom do Indologists compete successfully?  Perhaps this always reduces to
issues of personality and local dynamics.
Best,
