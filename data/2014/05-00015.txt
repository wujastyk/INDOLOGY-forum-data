Dear friends,
I inform with a heavy heart that I have been just now informed by Professor
N.N.Banerjee of Calcutta that my close friend and renowned Vedic scholar
Professor B.B.Chaubey breathed his last yesterday. He was 74. His
contributions to Indology are very well-known. Our families were very
close.  Mrs. Chaubey passed away long ago.
