Hello Erik and Dipak,
     I have a scanned pdf of this book.  Since it is 37mb, I cannot send it as an email attachment.  Will send it to the two of you using WeTransfer.com.  Let me know when you receive it.  Best,
Madhav Deshpande

Dear list-members,

Can any of you, perhaps, help me with a scan of  J. Gerson da Cunha?s version of the Sahy?drikha??a of the Skandapurana, Bombay 1877?
