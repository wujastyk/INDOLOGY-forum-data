[INDOLOGY] Prof. Dr. Michael Hahn (1941-2014)
Very sad news to receive while abroad. Just to affirm Dr. Hahn's willingness and indeed pleasure to share his hard earned knowledge of Sanskrit and Tibetan literatures with junior colleagues. I will regret many questions that never had the opportunity to be asked. 
Sincerely,
David Mellins
