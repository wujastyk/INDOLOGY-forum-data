[INDOLOGY] question about scene in Malay text from Sumatra
Perhaps the sea of fire in the Indonesian myth should not be the Va?av? of
Indian mythology. Va?av? is rather the fire that resides in water which is
its fuel. Cf., *abindhana? vahnim asau bibharti *Raghu 13.5 said of the
sea. The fire residing in the deep sea seems to have been referred to in
also in Ya?t 19.46-53. Long ago (2005) I merely speculated that the related
ideas might have their origin in the sight of natural fire produced in
mineral oil by the undivided Aryans. This cannot be pressed I admit. But
the sea of fire is missing both in Indian and Iranian versions.
Best wishes for all
