Subject: [INDOLOGY] Origin of the term "Indology"

Dear all,

I wish I knew.  Please keep me copied if anyone knows.  The term is 
clearly linked to the professionalization of the discipline in the early 
19th century (barring an early-bird neologism in the 18th).  This most 
likely takes us to Germany or France.  The OED notes the first 
occurrence of "Indology" very late, in 1888, and tellingly, in a Tr?bner 
catalog.  The first use I can recall offhand, and then of the related 
term "Indologen," occurs in a letter Christan Lassen sent A. W. v. 
Schlegel from Paris on 10 June 1825: "Von den Indologen ist mir nur Herr 
Burnouf zu Gesicht gekommen," in which he used the term in the flat 
tones of a well-worn word. Might we engage in a collective game of "beat 
that date," and see how far back we might reach?

In a related question, I wonder how accepted Indology/Indologie and 
related terms are accepted in common parlance in different languages.  
In spite of the OED's listing, my spellcheck consistently flags 
"Indology" and related terms as faulty.  I also recall the concern a 
British well-wisher expressed at the prospect of a (now published) book 
going by the title "The Making of Western Indology," since "Indology is 
not a word."  We explained that it was the name of our discipline, and I 
remember pointing out that it was also the name of our professional 
listserv.  Our friend was too polite to insist, but I am afraid that it 
convinced him right there and then that our book was not intended for 
the general public!

Best wishes,
