Greetings. I was hoping the list could help me with a term that has come up in an early 20th century historical work that I'm reading in Malayalam. The term is "gha?ik?vi??ati par?k?a." The author is discussing a series of exams that were given to a group of scholars at an annual assembly - one on poetry, one on drama, and a "gha?ik?vi??ati par?k?a." Does anyone know about this?
Thanks for your time and help. All best,
