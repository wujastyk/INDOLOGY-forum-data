[INDOLOGY] Vacaspati Misra's words
Dear List,
I will be grateful if anybody easily remember the source of the following words of Vacaspati Misra. It must be in one of his supercommentaries but I was unable to pinpoint it.
'ekasm?tisam?rohi??? var??n?m asaty apy arth?vabodhe suj??natv?t.'
Best Wishes,
Rohana
