Subject: [INDOLOGY] Studies of Signatures in Indian Epigraphy
Message-ID: <a5e410d45cfb4b1f99468e201be974c0@BY2PR06MB188.namprd06.prod.outlook.com>

Dear Colleagues,

Are there any special studies devoted to the use of signatures or attestations in Indian epigraphical sources?  I am particularly interested in medieval South India, but would appreciate any general leads as well.  Burnell has some remarks in his Indian Palaeography and the use of signatures is mentioned in most epigraphical studies of inscriptions that have them, of course.  The formula "svahasto mama" ('matam mama", etc) is ubiquitously mentioned in connection with Harsha and other kings.  But, I can't yet find a longer discussion of signatures or attestations.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Best regards,
