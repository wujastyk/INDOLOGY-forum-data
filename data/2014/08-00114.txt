[INDOLOGY] Atharvasirsopanisad !
In fact by Atharvasirshopanishad, only the [Saiva]Atharvasirshopanishad 
was meant at the beginning; the other ones such as 
theGanapatyatharvasirsopanisad, Devyatharvasirsopanisad, etc. are all 
later Upanishad-s modelled on the earliest [Saiva]Atharvasirshopanishad.
