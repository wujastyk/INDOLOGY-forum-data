Re: [INDOLOGY] Dharm?nubandhi?lokacaturda??
Hello Rohana,
     The world cat shows that the University of Iowa and Chicago libraries
have this item.  Also the University of California (Berkeley) library,
since Hathi Trust has digitized it from there, though it is not available
for downloading.  I could order it on interlibrary loan, but I am leaving
for India on Jan 5 and will be there till March 16.  In case you cannot get
it from any other source, let me know in March.  But if you do get a pdf
from some source, do forward it to me.  Best,
Madhav Deshpande
