Subject: [INDOLOGY] Anthropology of childhood in India
Message-ID: <250151389365927@web14m.yandex.ru>

Dear colleagues,
A student of mine (not a Sanskritist) wants to write her magister thesis about the childhood of men and childhood of gods in comparative perspective. Could you suggest some special literature on the topic, or some papers on childhood in classical India?
With best regards,
Victoria
