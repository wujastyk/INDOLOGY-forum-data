[INDOLOGY] (no subject)
To further back Dominik here, you will find several familiar names at http://www.petitiononline.com/ramanuj/petition.html.  Bear in mind, of course, that what occurred in Ramanujan's case was specific to Delhi University so it is only logical that initiatives  emanated (at least initially) from that institutional setting (whereas Doniger's situation is not localized in a similar fashion).

Re: [INDOLOGY] (no subject)
I'm sorry, but I really can't let this divisive and false assertion stand.  I certainly objected in the Ramanujan case, and I'm sure many other INDOLOGY members have raised their voices in all cases.  It is, of course, a matter for individual action and responsibility.  But a kind of "East-West divide" simply does not exist in this forum, and it is insidious to suggest so.  Such a position would be against everything this forum was created to support.
I am extremely sorry that you feel this way, and I would like to reassure you strongly that all academic indological authors who suffer censorship and ideological attack would be fully and equally supported by the members of the INDOLOGY forum.
Sincerly,
Dominik Wujastyk

While some Indology members took initiative in appealing against a law when an author from the West was affected by the law, no action was taken in such cases when South Asian authors were involved. I cite two cases -- Tasleema Nasreen and Ramanujan.  They have been banned, one exiled, for their views.
South Asian affairs are under Indology.
