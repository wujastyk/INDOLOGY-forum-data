I wonder how this topic
      India Elections 2014: The End of "Caste and Politics"
      by Alessandro Cisilin
is relevant to a journal said to be devoted to the study of Tantrism. As 
the very caption "Caste and Politics" suggests, one cannot connect even 
remotely any relation between Tantrism on the one hand and politics, 
voting, etc. on the other.
One is not sure about the agenda of the author as well as that of the 
Journal.
