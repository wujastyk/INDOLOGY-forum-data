Dear Dominik,

I am writing to draw your attention to two tenure-track jobs at UPenn.
?[...]

The first job is in "global health" in the dept. of hist. & soc. of
science. Geographic area and time-period are open and we are open to
considering non-historians as well. The second job is in the religious
studies dept. and in the "material/ visual studies" of religion. I am
pasting both advertisements below this email.

Thanks for your help.
Warmly,
Projit
