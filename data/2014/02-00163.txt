Eva Wilden has already given a satisfactory explanation for the tree and mountain.  According to Eva, "more easily to be connected with the rest of the poem may be that SHE is as much rooted in HIM as the I??i in the stone." Analyzing further, the stone can be taken to represent the strong hero and the tree with low aerial roots being the heroine weakened by the separation but still holding on to her faith in the hero.

Subject: Re: [INDOLOGY]  Periya Tirumo?i 8.2.2


Here is a literal translation of Ku?untokai 106 by Kapilar.


In his land, the white roots spreading on the mountain from the dun-colored (i.e. nondescript) runners of the i??i
look like waterfalls descending from a hill.
The words of his heart that holds no malice
have come (to me), friend,
and (I took them) as fire takes ghee/oil (OR they were like fire when ghee/oil is poured on it).
(Now) I must send a messenger to say
that I am the same as when we became (or were) lovers (or were married).


Here are two possible interpretations that I see:


The image of ghee/oil feeding a fire means that his words, which she did not expect, made her suddenly experience relief and passion.  In this case, Palaniappan is correct in interpreting ma?a as union and not marriage, especially as this appears to be a kuri?ci poem dealing with premarital love.  The messenger is likely to be a P??a?, though this is not expressed, and the situation, as in other ku?i?ci poems, is that the hero who used to come and see the heroine secretly at night is no longer coming.  The heroine becomes distressed but is suddenly heartened when a messenger (P??a??) comes and tells her that the hero still cares for her.  She immediately (like oil feeding fire) feels her passion and love flare up and wishes to send a message to the hero to tell him that she still cares and feels the same as when they were lovers.


HOWEVER there is a problem with this analysis, and that is the image of the runners and roots of the i??i tree, which clearly are intended to suggest that things are not as they seem.  That would suggest that we take ?which holds no malice? as sarcastic and the image of the fire taking the ghee/oil as one of anger flaring up (following the suggestion of the Kazhagam commentator, C?macuntara??r).  In that case, ma?a could mean ?marry? and the last line could mean ?the same as when we married.?  In this interpretation, the poem, in spite of its ku?i?ci imagery, is really a marutam poem and the hero, who has been with his courtesans, has sent the P??a? off to conciliate his angry wife.  She hears his words sanctimoniously describing the hero?s pure heart and sarcastically echoes them, concluding that she will send the messenger to tell him that while he has changed and is unfaithful to her, she has not changed.  She wishes to make the hero feel guilty.


Of these two interpretations, I think the second one is likely to be the correct one, as otherwise the image at the beginning of the poem does not make sense.  The point of the image would appear to be that just as the root of the rather ugly and parasitic i??i tree looks like a beautiful waterfall, the hero?s reprobate heart appears pure.  I don?t think the poem can be understood without discovering the intent of the image at its beginning, and that would seem to mean that this has to be a marutam poem.  It?s worth noting that Kapilar is one of the greatest Indian poets ? he is unlikely to have put in an image at the beginning of a poem that has no relation to its content.



n?? nil? mu??attu ni??u iva? n?kki???;
k??um?, Ka??apuram! e??u k???i???;
p??a??r ti??am irukka, i?i, iva?
n??um?? na??u na??u Na?aiy?rarkk?!



A literal translation:
She stood on the open space with its long moonlight and looked.
And she pointed asking ?Can one see the city of Ka??a? (Krishna) (from here)??
The excellent P??a? was firm, and now will she feel ashamed?
A fine thing indeed is this for the person from Na?aiy?r (Vi??u)!


It would seem that the hero/Vi??u is leading the heroine on, and that the P??a? is insisting on the hero?s uprightness.  The last line suggests that the hero (or Vi??u) is not as upright as the P??a? suggests.  This makes sense as a marutam poem, I think ? especially given the last line, which seems to me to have the connotation that the hero is not being honest with the heroine.  The poem has two perspectives ? the marutam situation in which the hero is with his courtesans but tries to conciliate the heroine by telling her he is a good person (which he is not, since he is visiting courtesans) and the religious one, in which God is playing with the soul of the devotee and is hard to get.  A notable thing about this is that P??a??r is made respective, suggesting that, as the commentary says, the P??a? symbolizes the ?c?ryas whose teachings bring the souls of others to Vi??u.  Perhaps the intent is that the ?c?ryas are firm in their teaching, and so devotees who hear them should not feel discouraged or ashamed, even though (last line) Vi??u is elusive.


There is a lot of speculation here. I believe that the Ku?untokai poem is probably a marutam poem about the hero visiting his courtesans and the same is true of the verse from the Periya Tirumo?i ? but it?s a tough call, and I would certainly see Palaniappan?s analysis as possible.

I think the solution to the problem presented by Periya Tirumo?i 8.2.2 is given by Ku?untokai 106 by Kapilar. What I am giving below is the poem based on the critical edition by Eva Wilden but with gemination of consonants shown in pu?arcci.








pul v?? i??ik kal ivar ve? v?r

The translation below is basically Eva Wilden's except that I have changed 'ghee' to 'oil' for ney.


Word has come to us, oh friend,
	from the faultless heart of the man from a land where,
	    like the waterfall descending the mountain,
	appears the stone-climbing white root of the talbot fig
									with low aerial roots,
   After receiving [his words] like fire into which oil is poured,
we too shall send a message saying    
					    'we are still those he united with.'


While ney can mean both oil and ghee, ney pey t? simply refers to a situation of 'adding fuel to the fire' as in the following passage from Arttamu??a Intumatam by Kannadasan, showing the common usage of oil being poured into a fire. 



"???;????? ???? ??????????????, ?????????????? ?????????.
???????? ????? ??????? ???????????? ??? ??? ??????????? ?????????.
 
??? ????? ??????????????????, ???? ???????????????? ??????? ????????????????? ??????????????????."


The notes given by UVS to Ku?untokai 106 show that the commentator I?amp?ra?ar considers the poem to describe a pre-marital situation in which the heroine does not dislike/is not angry at the messenger from the hero. But Nacci??rkki?iyar, another commentator, thinks the poem deals with a situation after marriage. A comment by P?r?ciriyar, another commentator, that receiving 'like fire into which ney is poured', is not possible in a pre-marital situation. May be he associates ney being poured into the fire with the Vedic fire ritual. I do not consider that a likely scenario. In contrast, I?amp?ra?ar's discussion of the poem in Ka?aviyal makes more sense. Wilden is right in translating 'ma?a-' as 'unite' and not as 'marry' as some scholars have done. The waterfall and mountain clearly suggest Ku?i?ci as the landscape, as some scholars have considered. There is nothing in the poem that suggests that there is an 'other woman' in the picture. So I do not agree with T. V. Gopal Iyer's view that this poem belongs to Marutam.


Who is the messenger here? According to Tolk?ppiyam Poru?atik?ram, those who are allowed to speak in poems dealing with pre-marital love include p?rpp?? (brahmin/priest), p??ka? (companion), heroine's friend, heroine's foster mother, hero and heroine. Although the commentary for I?aiya??r Ka?aviyal 3 identifies the companion as a p?rpp??, Nacci??rkki?iyar (commentary for Ka?aviyal 10) only says that the companion is "perump??mai p?rpp???m", i.e., in majority of the instances the companion is a brahmin/priest.  Although poems like Ku?untokai 156 suggest the companion being a brahmin/priest, Na??i?ai 250 and Na??i?ai 370, in both of which, the hero invites the bard to laugh with him, suggest that the companion could have been a bard earlier. Moreover Nacci??rkki?iyar in his commentary on Tol. P. 193 refers to p??a? as p??ku pa??o?ukum p??a? and p??i?i as talaivim???up p??k?yo?ukum p??i?i even as Tol.P. 193 lists p??ka? separately from the bard and his female counterpart. Interestingly, in their commentaries to the s?tra beginning with "ava?a?i v???a", I?amp?ra?ar considers Na??i?ai 90 as spoken to the hero's companion. But Nacci??kki?iyar considers the same poem as spoken to the bard. 


Thus whatever be the view of the later grammarians in classifying the companions as distinct from the bards and that only companions could speak in poems dealing with pre-marital love, the internal evidence from the poems suggest that the bards could have been companions too. If that were accepted then, they could have served as messengers not only after marriage but before marriage too. 


If that were accepted, Periya Tirumo?i 8.2.2, makes eminent sense.  A maiden being in love with the hero (Vi??u), the bard (p??a??r interpreted as religious teacher) acting as a messenger, and the girl being resolute in passion towards Vi??u, all fit the pre-marital love scenario with no 'other woman' being present.  The lack of anger towards the messenger also explains the honorific form, p??a??r.


I would appreciate any comments on this solution.


Thanks in advance.

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Periya Tirumo?i 8.2.2





Even with the understanding that the devotional poems of the Vai??ava saints do not strictly follow the conventions of the Classical Tamil love poetry, the interpretation of Periya Tirumo?i 8.2.2 is perplexing. Here is the verse given in Periya Tirumo?i Ira???m Tokuti (with Periyav?cc?? Pi??ai's commentary translated into Tamil by Ti. V?. K?p?laiyar) produced by EFEO and published by Teyvac C?kki??r Caivacitt?ntap P??ac?lai, Ta?c?v?r, 2006, p. 962.


n?? nil? mu??attu ni??u iva? n?kki???;
k??um?, Ka??apuram! e??u k???i???;
p??a??r ti??am irukka, i?i, iva?
n??um?? na??u na??u Na?aiy?rarkk?!


The verse is supposed to be the utterance of a mother about her daughter in love with Vi??u. The traditional commentary (p. 965) explains 'p?????r' in the verse by relating it to the Classical Tamil Marutam genre in which the bard acts as a messenger from the husband to his wife , who is mad at him for having gone to the other woman. But then it goes on to explain that 'p??a??r' represents the religious teachers, who act to bring the souls toward 'God' and that in the verse the girl is resolute in her faith because of the religious teachers. And the mother concludes that the resolute girl will not be bashful in expressing her love toward Vi??u.  See attachment. 


I am not convinced by the commentary's explanation about the association with Marutam, the resoluteness of the bard, who is referred to in a very respectful way, and the lack of bashfulness of the girl. The respectful way the bard is mentioned suggests more of Mullai.  Won't a better interpretation be that the mother talks about her daughter, a maiden, who sends a message to her beloved through the bard; the bard comes back with the message that the hero will join her soon; emboldened by this certainty, the maiden has no bashfulness in expressing her love; and the mother is critical of the hero for causing this immodest behavior in her daughter? (Of course, many ti?ai conventions are violated here too.)


I would appreciate any comments on this verse and possible interpretations.


Thanks in advance

Palaniappan
