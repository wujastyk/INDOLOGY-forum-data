[INDOLOGY] fr.wikipedia and ohter non sa.wikipedia
Is there any taboo about contributing to Wikipedia? Though I guess many
indologists are not against knowledge-sharing for free and improving the
general knowledge about India, I am the only indologist/sanskritist in the
fr.wikipedia and feel like hell about it  How is it in other wikis: en, de,
etc,?
