Dear Members,
 
It is very sad that on 2nd July 2005, Dr.B.N.K.Sharma - one of the  great indologists passed away. He was an erudite and athentic scholar of Dvaita Vedanta who published more than 20 publications on the Dvaita Philosophy and authored hundreds of research papers. For the first time in the history he wrote the history of Dvaita vedanta.This is for the information of our Vednatin members of this list.
 
Let us pay homage to him and rememer his services.
 
regards,
srivara.
