Indologists can use new VoIP technology to save on              communication costs
Good point!
Those using Macs: try  skype:
http://www.skype.com/products/
It works on all systems (windows etc.)
Not only (free)  comp. to comp. talk, but also:
from your comp. to telephone numbers in most countries.
In that case it costs you 1 US cent per minute  (put in $10, on your 
credit card, to start with)
Obviously useful to talk to your old relatives &  colleagues who do not 
use a computer or are away form online services, in the field...
It works fine.  Also conference calls.
(For those who want to talk to me: write, and I will give you my skype 
online name.)
