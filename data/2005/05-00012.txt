conjunct characters in devanagari
For a lengthy statistical discussion of conjuncts appearing in Sanskrit
and Hindi, one may wish to consult Ulrich Steihl's "Technical Manual
for Itranslator 2003" appearing on his Sanskritweb site:
http://www.sanskritweb.net/itrans/itmanual2003.pdf
The appendix (by Ernst Tremel) discusses Hindi conjuncts. Steihl also
makes reference to a book he has authored entitled
"Konsonantenverbindung in Sanskrit" (2002), but I have been unable to
locate additional bibliographical information regarding this
publication.
