elves: Indic counterpart?
Tolkien's elves are slightly taller than the average human being, which I believe was the more common opinion in England before Shakespeare got to them.  Fairies also were tall, usually. 
There is a good discussion of this sort of lore in the chapter "The longaevi" in C.S. Lewis's The Discarded Image: an introduction to medieval and Renaissance literature."

mini-beings, as I've not read Tolkien)."
