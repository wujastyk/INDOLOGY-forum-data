body in discussions of the soul
One might also consider it at least an implied duality in the many
denunciations of the body as just a bag of "pus and blood" etc. in texts
like the Upanisads. I'm not sure how explicitly the duality was stated
though. At the time I wasn't reading the texts with that concept in mind.
Best,
