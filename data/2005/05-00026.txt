Subject: elves: Indic counterpart?

I'm revisiting this question--wasn't it prompted by a query on the
translation of elf into Hindi for exhibiting the Lord of the Rings movie in
India?  Seems the translators could have used the word vaaman -- dwarf. A
dwarf in folklore is close to an elf, after all.
