Nakula's Shield
In MBh 2((28)66.14 Nakula is said to take up his sword and shield with the
eight moons. A seemingly identical shield is found in the Dev&#299; M&#257;h&#257;tmya 9:12
Ni&#347;umbha is found to wield an identical shield. Is there a connection
between the two sets of twins?
Thank you in advance.
