Dear Indological Colleagues,

A prospective Graduate student for our program has asked for help in 
identifying the languages of two manuscripts in her university's 
library collection. While I suspect possibly Burmese and either Pali 
or Sinhala, both are completely outside of my linguistic ken

We have posted them at:

http://huntingtonarchive.osu.edu/Mystery_Manuscript/Mystery_Manuscript.html

All the library wants in the language group but anything else that 
can provided easily  will be much appreciated.

If it is of interest, both seen to be complete.

Thank you in advance

John
