Subject: WORD 2004 custom dictionary
Message-ID: <161227077269.23782.13516059058043896687.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Colleagues,

I apologize for the cross-posting if you have seen this query already.

I am wondering if anyone has discerned how to add words in Unicode 
font (especially Times Extended Roman) to a/the custom dictionary on 
Microsoft Word 2004 (OS X). I know this has been an issue for others 
given conversations I have had recently. WORD 2004 does not seem to 
allow adding such words, stating that either the dictionary is full 
(it is not) or that the word contains "non-roman" characters.

If anyone has figured out how to get around this, I would be very 
grateful to hear, as I'm sure others would.

Best Wishes,
--
