Thank you, Hans-jii
It's just that  I have personal difficulty with imagining someone repeating 
during one short conversation several times something like "may you live!", 
and then obtaining in answer a similar portion of "'may- you-live!"s. 
Persian calque? Possibly. But I have some buts, oops - doubts.
Is jiiva/jiivatu attested in some sanskrit (prakrit) texts in expressions 
equivalent to maataa-jii, pitaa-jii? Or achhaa-jii? Or with the meaning of 
"yes, right"? Or in phrases like pitaa-jii ne kahaa? "My 
father-may-you-live! said". Strange, if I may say. Sounds a bit incongruous.
How and by whom was this etymology accepted?
Regards-jii
