c) From Prof. William Jackson (Indiana University):
"I would agree with P. Sambamoorthy that O Rangasayi shows
signs of being a composition from the later period of Tyagaraja's
life. Sambamoorthy says these later compositions "are characterized by
mature music and mature ideas in the sahitya. These are highly polished and
delicately chiselled pieces." He write this on p. 258 of his book
Great Composers, Book II Tyagaraja, seconf edition, Madras: The Indian Music
Publishing House, 1970."
Thanks all. Great example of efficient scholarly communication to answer 
research questions!
