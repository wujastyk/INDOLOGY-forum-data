rupees past
Matthew,
Certain daily newspapers from that time period would have covered such 
information. I vaguely remember seeing it in one of the newspapers on the 
front page. I know that Amrit Bazar Patrika (Calcutta), The Times of India 
(Bombay), and The Hindu (Madras) were published during that time period and 
may have such information. Her Majesty's Office also used to publish such 
data. None of this information is specific but I think if you have access 
to the newspapers, you will find what you are looking for.
Hope this is helpful.
