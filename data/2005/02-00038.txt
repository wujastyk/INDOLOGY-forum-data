Subject: elves: Indic counterpart?
Message-ID: <161227075891.23782.5723722770317267013.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

A Thai friend is trying to translate the poem on the Ring in the Lord of
the Rings into Thai, for a multilingual page of such translations.  She
asked me for help on what would be a good translation for "elves," since
Thai lore of supernatural beings is largely based on Indian.  The only
thing I could think of was gandharvas, since they are beautiful,
elegants, and sprightly, but they are erotic in a way in which elves (at
least Tolkien's) aren't. I am inclined to think there really isn't
anything much like elves, either Tolkien's or others'.  But does anyone
have any ideas?
