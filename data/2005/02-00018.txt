Phenomenology in Sanskrit
Dear list members,
I understand this is a neologism, but nevertheless wonder what would be the most likely candidate for the phenomenology of respectively Kant, Hegel, and Husserl:
- AbhAsavAda
- prapancavAda
- dRgviSayatAvAda
- AlokavAda
- vyanjanavAda
- prAdurbhAvavAda
- sAkSAtkAravAda
Regards,
Plamen
