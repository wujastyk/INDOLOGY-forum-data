Dear meber,
   Kindly tell me if anybody knows about the copyright principles for E-contents presented on web?  
  New website of SANSKNET {Rasshtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha} is ready to host. But, the authorities want to have some licence for downloading etc., Kindly write to me personally if anybody of you is knowldegable in such issues.
  regards,
  shrivara.
