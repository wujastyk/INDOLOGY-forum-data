Heartiest Congratulations!
Dear Cristoph and Srilata,
The invitation came in today, at first I thought it was an Easter
card, so I was doubly suprised and delighted when I opened it!  What
wonderful news -- I do not believe I will be able to make it there in
person, but certainly I will be present in spirit.
Don't forget to come and visit next time you are in the country, we
can feast you then!
Alex
