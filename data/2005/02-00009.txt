A simple note:
JayAnanda
It is very dubious whether JayAnanda may really be considered an
Indian as such, at least in this conext; although referred to as a
Kashmiri, the cy. to which Ulrich refers appears to have been written
either in Tibet or even in the Tangut country. See Leonard v d Kuijp
in Central Asiatic Journal 1993: 188-197.
