e-Monier Williams Dictionary for Macs
Dear All
I have tried installing some e-versions of the Monier Williams Sanskrit
dictionary on my computer, but they were for PCs and as I am a Mac-only
user I found they were not compatible with my Mac.
One of the versions I tried (based on the Cologne Digital Sanskrit Lexicon)
worked in all respects except - the resident IT expert tells me - that the
fonts provided were not compatible with a Mac. Thus I do get access to the
html pages (one for each letter of the alphabet), but the Sanskrit
characters show up as, for example, [khakAra]3[kha--kAra] rather than in
correct transliteration or Devanagari.
Would any of you be able to suggest:
1) how to get hold of a Mac-compatible font for the above programme
AND / OR
2) Whether Mac-compatible e-versions of the MW exist, and how to get hold
of them if they do.
Many thanks for any suggestion
With best wishes to you all
