Mahaparinirvana-sutra
Friends,
in the Pali Mahaa-parinibaana-sutta we read:
"attadiipaa viharatha attasara.naa ana~n~nasara.naa dhammadiipaa 
dhammasara.naa ana~n~nasara.naa"
Is there a Sanskrit / Tibetan / Chinese version of this sentence?
My problem is: is "diipa" here = Skt. "diipa" (lamp) or "dviipa" (island)? 
Be a lamp for yourselves, or be an island to yourselves?
(The much later Pali commentary understands it as island.)
Thanks,
Ferenc
