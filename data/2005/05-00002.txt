Prakrit manuscripts on Indian ebay
Dominik et al
As an art historian, I advise against crying. The look way too good
to be genuinely old. I suspect that they are simply over priced
reproductions. In additions the asking price is also indicative that
they are copies. Internationally, real pages go for several thousand
dollars.
