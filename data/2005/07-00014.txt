Kautilya bibliography
Heartfelt thanks to those of you who answered my query! I got some very
useful information. I was unaware of the Bibliography of Asian Studies
Online, but I should be able to access it from my university computer - it
doesn't work from home without paying 75 dollars. 
Best regards,
Lars Martin
