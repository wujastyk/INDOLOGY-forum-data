rupees past
Thanks to Allen Thrasher, Hermann Tull and Marina Orelskaya
for your responses. Marina's suggest to consult Ambedkar's
book is particularly helpful, as it includes much data
on trade and commodity values. This is especially useful
in relation to the particular problem that motivated my
query: how to interpret late-19th and early-20th c.
reports on Tibetan economy and trade, which the agents of
the Raj always reported in approximate rupee valuations.
