Dear colleagues,
The provisional version of the ieb-cb virtual union catalogue may be of
interest to some readers.
Self description from the title page:
Indica-et-buddhica.org-Catalogus bibliothecarum (ieb-cb) is a virtual
union catalogue providing centralised access to library servers with
significant indological and buddhological collections.
Searches can be conducted using a range of attributes, terms and
operators. Records can be retrieved in various syntaxes, formats and
quantities. In addition to bibliographical data, many records contain
location, holding and availability details.
Ieb-cb is designed to facilitate the transfer of indological and
buddhological data across large networks. It will enable researchers to
rapidly locate and obtain records from widely distributed library
servers.
