urna mudra?
Do you refer to a sitting or a standing Buddha?
Could it be related to the Usnisa Dharani?
Or the vyakarana :
Instead all the Buddhas will bestow prediction (Vyakarana) onto these beings
who will never regress the path to Anuttara-samyak-samboddhi (complete
enlightenment)."
But no sign of a mudra on this page!
