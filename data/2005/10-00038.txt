rupees past
Would any of you have some information on
the exchange rate for the rupee in about 1900?
If, in addition to the rupee to pounds and/or dollar rates,
there are estimates of values in current rupees, i.e.,
the inflation index, that would be useful to me as well.
with thanks,
Matthew Kapstein
