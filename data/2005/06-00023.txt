Dear Tamar,
Some time ago I came across a reference to an article by you on
something concerning the Anugita. If I remember wel it was published in
a Felicitation volume for Wendy Doniger. The problem is I cannot find
the reference again (even Google fails me). A student of mine is at the
moment writing an MA thesis on some part of the Anugita and therefore he
(and I) are very interested in your article. On the other hand, our
library is very slow and if it concerns a new publication it will take
at least another year for the book to be on the shelves. Is it possible
for you to send me a photocopy of the article.

Sincerely yours

Herman Tieken
