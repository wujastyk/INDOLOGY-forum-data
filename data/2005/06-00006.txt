ASIAN READING ROOM OF THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS
TO OPEN ON SATURDAYS
A Pilot Program, April 9 to October 8, 2005 
	The Asian Reading Room of the Library of Congress has been open on Saturdays for a trial period of six months since April 9, 2005.  The hours of the Asian Reading Room are Monday through Saturday from 8:30 a.m. until 5:00 p.m. 
	The Asian Division houses more than 2.7 million items in more than 200 Asian languages.  The collection covers topics ranging from art to zoology. For many Asian languages, it holds the largest collection of material outside of Asia.
	The Asian Division offers reference services pertaining to all countries in South, Southeast and East Asia, as well as the Pacific Islands.  The Asian Division also provides patrons with access to a wide variety of electronic resources that are only available within subscribing libraries.  Books can be requested upon arrival in the reading room. However, patrons using the collections on Saturdays are encouraged to request materials in advance. Requests can be faxed to (202) 252-3336 or sent by email to asianrequest at loc.gov. All requests should include the title, language and call number of the materials requested; the name of the patron and the patron's reader registration ID number.
	The Asian Reading Room is located in Room 150 of the Library's Thomas Jefferson Building, 10 First St. S.E., Washington, D.C., one block north of the Capitol South Metro station. The Library's 21 reading rooms are open to members of the public over the age of 18. Those wishing to enter the reading rooms must first obtain a reader registration card in Room 140 of the James Madison Building, 101 Independence Ave. S.E., Washington, D.C. Patrons are advised to come in from the Madison Building to avoid long waiting lines to enter the Library from the Jefferson Building. After getting a reader's card at Room LM 140 in the Madison Building, take the tunnel on "G" level, follow the signage to the Jefferson Building and then to the Asian Reading Room (Room LJ 150) on the first floor.
