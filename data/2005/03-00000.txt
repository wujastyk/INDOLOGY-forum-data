For various reasons I have to give a library patron a quick evaluation of this book:

My library's copy is not on shelf.  Can anyone tell me  (1) if it is well-organized,  (2) if it confines itself wholly or mostly to Hungarian scholarship, and (3) does it have evaluative essays on works, or just list them?

Thanks,

Allen Thrasher
