Indragopa (was Re: lac insect)
Indragopa insect: Most of the Indic dictionaries say `cochineal' which
can't be true because that's S. American.  I thought for a while it was
this red/black wasp.  But again, probably not.  I now believe I've got
good authorities for thinking that indragopa = indragopaa = lac =
laaksaa = Kerria lacca (Kerr.).
