Witzel's interview
Here is my two-cents worth.
The following received editorial change is simply wrong:
Replace with the following: ?Ayurveda incorporates significant input from 
the tradition of yoga. Though principally a pathway to spiritual liberation, 
yoga as a discipline of breathing and bodily functions finds a place of 
honor in most medical and healing traditions of India.?
A form of Yoga incorporated certain Ayurvedic practices and principles only 
from about the 16th century CE, as seen in the obscure text, Ayurveda Sutra. 
Ayurveda began to incorporate certain practical techniques mentioned, among 
others, in Yoga texts only in the modern era, largely through the influence 
of Maharshi Mahesh Yoga's TM movement.
Best,
