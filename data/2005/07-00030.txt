19th century book
I forgot to add:
The first of the two listings was filmed for SAMP (South Asia Microform 
Prohject)  at the BL, and is likely from Serampore.  The second is the 
only Tulsidas Ramcharitmanas at the BL from the 1830s.  The source of 
both citations is "Holdings of 19th Century publications at the British 
Library's Oriental and Indian Office Collections" at < 
http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/oioc.py>, which is more complete than 
the on-line catalogue at the BL.
