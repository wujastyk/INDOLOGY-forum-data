Royal Takeover in Nepal
Dear David,
Thank you for forwarding this. I hope that
other subscribers to INDOLOGY will concur with me
that, because many of us have had long
and close contact with Nepal, the sharing
of information such as Kanak's report is,
during these very difficult times, invaluable.
Once you have your information resource up and
running on SARAI, please do circulate notice
of the fact.
with regards,
Matthew
