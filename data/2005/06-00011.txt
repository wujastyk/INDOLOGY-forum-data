Etymology of honorific particle jI
but -jii is not equivalent to upadhyaaya, -arjee is.
Thus, we find the pairs in Bengali
Chattopadhyay/Chatterji
Mukhopadhyay/Mukherjee

of the common invitation to lunch in Bronx English:
jeet?
which, with just a little more erosion will no doubt
someday be pronounced "jee" as well!
kyaa socte haiN, jii?
