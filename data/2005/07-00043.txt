Ramayana
There are some excellent studies of the language of the Ramayana:
Oberlies, T. 2003 'Grammar of Epic Sanskrit'. Indian Philology and South Asian Studies, vol. 5.Berlin/New York, Walter de Gruyter.
Satya Vrat. 1964 The Ramayana - a Linguistic Study. Delhi, Munshiram Manoharlal.
Michelson 1904 Linguistic Archaisms of the Ramayana. Journal of the American Oriental Society 25: pp89-145
I hope these help.
