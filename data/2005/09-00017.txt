The adbuction of the lotus-flower by the king of elephants
Dear List,
about a king abducting a princess, I come across the following simile:
jahaara raajatanayaaM  gajaraa.d iva padminiim
I do not know any mythological story about a king of elephants abducting a
lotus-flower (of course, a possible meaning of padminii is "female
elephant", but the male elephant usually do not abduct the female).
Has somebody already come across this simile in kaavya, or such a story in
any kathaa?
Thank you,
