SV: e-Monier Williams Dictionary for Macs
Interestingly,
The experience given below concerning PC simulators on Macs exactly echo the
experience I made with such a program 8 years ago. It worked slowly, it was
unreliable, and it caused crashes. If the technology hasn't matured by now,
the best solution is probably to buy a PC if you really need a PC software
capability.
