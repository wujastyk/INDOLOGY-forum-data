Sanskrit Google
http://sa.wikipedia.org/wiki/  (Sanskrit version of Wikipedia) that
way.
Here is the Indology fork of sa.wikipedia.org, containing excerpts from
original Sanskrit works, like this
http://deva.indopedia.org/Bhasya_101.html
The problem is that Wikipedia works properly only with Code2000
Even the TITUS fonts are failing to reproduce correctly the Sanskrit texts.
Please, advise what font to install on Windows for covering both Devanagari
and ALL diacritics.
Thanks,
