Earliest example of Indian iconography is Kushan?
By the term "Indian iconography" do you mean "Hindu
iconography"?
As far as the Hindu iconography is concerned, Hindu
gods such as Lakshmi and Surya were depicted, in a way
known from later times, already on the Buddhist stupa
of Bharhut (2nd BC) and on the stupa railings in
Sanchi. For a quick look, see Harle: The art and
architecture of the Indian subcontinent (p.26ff).
