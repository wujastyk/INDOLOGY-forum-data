Maybe you have checked the book already by yourself. But
anyway, here is the result of my inspection: ad no. 3: it
is a bibliography that lists works and articles, it is not
a bibliographie raisonn?e with summaries; ad no. 2: it is
confined to Hungarian publications or titles that were
published in Hungary or by Hungarians; ad no. 1: the
editor put the contents under subject headings like
"Jawaharlal Nehru" which is the first, then "Folksways and
Country. Ethnography, Geography", then "Itinary ...", then
"Indian Philology" etc.
Hope it helps
