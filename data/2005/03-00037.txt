Subject: [RISA-L] Why no 'shrautas,' given 'smaartas'?
Message-ID: <161227076132.23782.11311321089714050720.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

There is another distinct use of the term smArta that occurs at some point in time especially in South India.  There is a general distinction between VaiSNava and smArta brahmins, the latter typically worshipping Ziva as well as ViSNu.  But not all worshippers of Ziva are smArta brahmins.  Evidently the dIkSita brahmins of Chidambaram who own the naTarAja temple and officiate in the temple are not smArta (nor VaiSNava obviously), and that creates an impression that the term smArta at some point simply becomes an ethnic term in this region.

Smartas are really not Brahmins who STUDY the smritis, but those who
follow the smrit rituals -- for the most part domestic -- as opposed
to those who act as priests in temples.

There need not be a term to refer to those Brahmins who study the
Veda, because theoretically all are supposed to study and read the
Vedas. There are other words that refer to Brahmins who are "well
versed in" or "experts" in the Veda. For example, "bahuzruta",
"zrotriya", and (in its later meaning) "brahmavadin".
