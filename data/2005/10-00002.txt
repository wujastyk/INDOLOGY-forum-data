Tagore - A Passion Play
Dear Colleagues,
could any body please help me with bibliographic details about  
Rabindranath Tagore's novel "A Passion Play" (orginal title "choker  
bali")? I am somehow unable to find out in which anthology it (the English  
translation) has been published. It is not available in any online  
catalogue I have access to.
Thanks in advance for your help and apologies for possible cross-postings.
