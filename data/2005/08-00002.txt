bibliography for Indian numerals
Stephen Chrisomalis has posted on his website on word oddities, the Phrontistery, a working bibliography for his doctoral dissertation, The Comparative History of Numerical Notation (McGill, 2003).
The URL is <http://phrontistery.info/nnsbib.html>. 
There are numerous articles on Indian numerals included.  I have quickly scanned the list and haven't noticed any articles specifically on the number-word systems, or any titles that aren't in the usual bibliographies, but there are over a thousand titles in the list and it needs a closer look.
