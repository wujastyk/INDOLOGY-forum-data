Tilak reference?
"Chaldean and Indian Vedas" by B.G. Tilak, originally published in the Bhandarkar Commemoration Volume, 1917, reprinted in B.G. Tilak's posthumously published book: Vedic Chronology and Vedanga Jyotisha, 1925, published by Messrs Tilak Bros, Gaikwar Wada, Pune, pp. 125-144, followed by "opinions of well-known Assyrian scholars" on this article.

Re: Tilak reference?
Many thanks to Madhav and David.  This is the article that I need to
cite.  Madhav, would you please forward the page numbers from that
publication when you have the time?  What is of interest in this article
is that it claims that the Babylonian god Tiamat is referred to at AVZ
5.13.4 with the word *taimAta'*, apparently a water-snake of some sort. 
The article also claims that the Babylonian goddess Apsu  is referred to
in a number of Vedic apsu-compounds.
As it turns out, an intrepid comparatist has recently used these, um,
fanciful etymologies to support his claim that there was  a significant
diffusion channel connecting Babylonian mythology not only to the Indus
Valley Culture, but also to Vedic.  My article attempts to debunk this
silliness.
Also, another curiosity in this AVZ hymn: the presence of the obscure
term *tAbu'va* at AVZ 5.13.10, which seems to refer to another snake, or
a snake-demon, or snake-poison.  Nevertheless, it used to be suggested
that it is a certain Polynesian word, which has surfaced in English as
"taboo."
Human imagination is a marvelous thing!
Thanks again to David and Madhav,
George
