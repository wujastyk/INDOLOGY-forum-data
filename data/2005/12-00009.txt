Book
Hope this is not perceived as a self-promotion -- just a note to 
inform you about a new book that may be a useful resource published 
by Motilal.
Dharmasuutra Parallels, Motilal, 2005.
This contains in four columns on each page the parallel passages in 
the four ancient Dharmasuutras bearing on a particular topic -- both 
the Sanskrit and the English translation. Having them visually side 
by side, I hope, is helpful in seeing the similarities and 
differences in the treatment of various topics by these texts.
Thanks.
Patrick
