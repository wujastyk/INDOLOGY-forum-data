Dear Dan,

I'm wondering if someone on list can help me better identify a gem: vai??rya
[snip] Does this term have a single referent in Sanskrit, or did it apply to 
different
gems at different times and places in India?

I looked into this some years ago and, as far as I could tell, it is just 
blue beryl, though it would not be surprising if if it occasionally denoted 
something else.  The term in Tibetan is also understood as beryl.

Best wishes,
