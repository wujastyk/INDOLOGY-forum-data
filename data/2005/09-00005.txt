I'm wondering if someone on list can help me better identify a gem: vai??rya

gems at different times and places in India?

I looked into this some years ago and, as far as I could tell, it is just 
blue beryl, though it would not be surprising if if it occasionally denoted 
something else.  The term in Tibetan is also understood as beryl.
