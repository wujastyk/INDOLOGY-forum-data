Just for the record: IHQ vol. 4, pp. 563-567 contains an article by C. S. 
Srinivasachari: "Progress in South Indian epigraphy". On pp. 566-567 the 
author shortly deals with the Tanjore Nayakas and mentions: "Details of 
his [Govindadiksita's] life are given in the Sahityaratnakara by his 
son ...]". This refers to Yajnanarayana(diksita): Sahityaratnakara.
