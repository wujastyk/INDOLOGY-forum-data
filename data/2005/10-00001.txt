> You may find very useful my Sanskrit Mahakavya "Ramapratapa-caritam"(2 vols) with Hindi and English translation and a long introduction, available at Chaukhamba Sanskrit Prakashan, Bunglow Road, Delhi-7. Ths Mahakavya deals with the life and teachings of Ramaprata who was a great sanskrit scholar of the twentieth century and a great Raja-yogi. He had several spritual powers such as Vaak-siddhi( all his words became truth) and Divya Drsti(divine transcental perception) which were experienced by thousands and thousands of persons. An Italian translation of this mahakavya "Vita Di Un Saggio(has been published in Milan (L#Oca Del Cairo) in 2005.
