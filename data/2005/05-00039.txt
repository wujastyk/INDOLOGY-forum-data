Dear Dr. Steinkellner,

This new attempt at Dignaga's text is exciting news. However, the link
doesn't work. The oeaw site gives this message:

Die von Ihnen angeforderte Seite konnte nicht gefunden werden!
The requested page was not found on the server!

Is there a different link than www.oeaw.ac.at/Mat/dignaga_PS_1.pdf  ?

Thank you.

Dan Lusthaus

Dear Colleagues,


Following the efforts of H. R. Rangaswamy Iyengar in 1930, the Muni
Jambuvijaya in 1961, 1966,1976, and Masaaki Hattori in 1968, a further
attempt at reconstructing the Sanskrit text of Dignagats Pramanasamuccaya
with its Vrtti is now available for the first chapter "On Perception" as PDF
under the address www.oeaw.ac.at/Mat/dignaga_PS_1.pdf:



Dignagats Pramanasamuccaya, Chapter 1.
