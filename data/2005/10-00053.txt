b) From Prof. Indira Viswanathan Peterson (Mt. Holyoke College):

"Dear Harry,
You beat me to the reply. I completely agree with you. I would dismiss all
the stories about "stages of bhakti" guiding his compositions, and I would
indeed think of the Kanchipuram invitation and the grand pilgrimage as the
possible occasion for the composition of O Rangashayee, which is indeed
dedicated to Ranganatha at Srirangam, near Trichy. If we go with this
possibility, we could also place "raju vedale jutaamu raare kasturi ranga" 
in Todi raga (a krti that very clearly invites the listener to view 
Rangaraja on the banks of the Kaveri in Srirangam -- kaveri tiramu
nanu..rangapurini..srivelayu..etc). during the same pilgrimage."
