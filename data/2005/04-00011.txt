Jonathan,

I'm not aware of any, but I would expect that the frequent writing of darZana in verse would create a strong tendency to use all the words as complete synonymns, metris causa.

Dear Colleagues,

I am wondering if anyone knows of a study of the vocabulary for
'body' employed in discussions of the existence of the soul, and the
body-soul (or mind-body) problem, or can offer any insight.

My extremely superficial impression is that zariira is a common word
in such contexts, but do other terms (kaaya, deha, ???) also appear?
(I likewise presume that the most common words for the other member
of the pair include aatman, jiiva, prakrti, though I am less
interested in this side of the question.)

With many thanks, JAS
