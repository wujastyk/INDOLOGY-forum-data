Dear Colleagues,
could any body please help me with bibliographic details about
Rabindranath Tagore's novel "A Passion Play" (orginal title "choker
bali")? I am somehow unable to find out in which anthology it (the English
translation) has been published. It is not available in any online
catalogue I have access to. Thanks in advance for your help and apologies
for possible cross-postings.
