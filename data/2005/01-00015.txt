This volume furnishes one more previously unpublished document of the 
pre-tenth-century thought-world of the Saiva Siddh?nta, a religion that was 
spread across and beyond the Indian subcontinent at the probable time of 
this work's composition. For the Par?khyatantra dates from the period 
before the appearance of the most significant body of theological exegesis 
in the history of the school, namely the writings of the tenth-century 
Kashmirian lineage of Bha.t.ta R?maka.n.tha II.  The addition of the 
Par?khya to the still small corpus of published early Saiddh?ntika writings 
should be a welcome event to the student of classical Indian religions. 
What is presented here, however, is not the whole text but only those 
chapters of it that deal with doctrine and yoga.  Those on ritual and other 
aspects of religious practice have not been transmitted in the unique codex 
- a beautiful palm-leaf manuscript in minute Nandin?gar? script - and are 
therefore lost.  Many quotations from the text have been located in later 
literature, and a fully positive apparatus reports the readings of all 
sources.

A complete English translation - the first to appear of an early 
Siddh?ntatantra - accompanies the Sanskrit text.  Copious notes discuss 
textual difficulties and problems of interpretation.  In doing so, they 
draw on parallels with other Saiddh?ntika writings, both published and 
unpublished. The introduction places the Par?khya in its context, gives a 
r?sum? of the work, characterises its language and concludes with a 
detailed discussion of the sources and of how they have been used.
