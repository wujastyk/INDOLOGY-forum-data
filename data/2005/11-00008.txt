Allen,
a side note about Indian dissertations: In a conversation a few months ago, 
with Dr. T.A.V. Murthy (Director of INFLIBNET/UGC, Ahmedabad) and with Dr. 
V.S. Cholin (akso with INFLIBNET), I was told that they have begun to put 
in place a nation-wide dissertation database, which *might* prospectively 
include full-texts of the dissertations. I don't know if I have the details 
exactly, but I do know they are working on something of this sort. (A 
version of the Inflibnet's Theses Database can be found at:
<http://www.inflibnet.ac.in/dbase/thesesDb.jsp>, but I have not been able 
to get any records to display...
