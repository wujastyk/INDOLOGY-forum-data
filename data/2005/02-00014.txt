diacritics
To type diacritics and accents used for transliterations of Indic texts
I would recommend you try using a unicode font and input system. There
are plenty of free fonts and free keyboard utilities available. You
should be able to find a solution that fits your needs provided you have
a modern operating system (Windows 2000, XP; Mac OX X.2; Linux). You can
find information on such things on various web pages including the Early
Buddhist Manuscripts Project's website.
