Thanks for your comment. I'd say the use of the Pali/Buddhist Skt 
expressions Ayasmant/AyuSmant is contextually quite limited.JI, on the 
contrary, has a very wide field of usage. I would still like to see 
equivalents of modern Hindi usage in Sanskrit or Prakrit (even Apabhramsha) 
texts. Are there any attested? I just looked for 'jIva' in the text of 
Svapnavasavadatta and Abhijnanasakuntala and found it used for not more 
than 10 times, in one phrase: ciraM jIva/jIvatu.
