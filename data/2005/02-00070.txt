Dear David,

Please do not apologize for forwarding this to 
the list, on the contrary, thank you!
Kanik is a very important and thoughtful 
journalist and it is good to hear his opinion. 
Many of us in Sanskrit and Buddhist studies are 
deeply involved in Nepal in a variety of ways and 
want every bit of information we can get.

John
