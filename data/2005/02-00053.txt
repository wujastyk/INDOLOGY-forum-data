>?From MW:

iliibi;sa 'name of a demon conquered by Indra (.Rgveda 1.33.12),

ilvala 'name of a daitya (the brother of Vaataapi' (Mahabhaarata,
Hari-va.m;sa, Vaayu Puraa.na),

iviilaka 'name of a son of Lambodara (= an epithet of Ga.ne'sa, who is a
dwarf and has a protruding belly)

Further, ilvakaa 'name of the five stars in the head of Orion
(M.rga-;siras)' may be based on a myth lost to us.

I also wonder if iliibi;sa mentioned above may have, through metathesis,  a
connection with "iblis,' Arabic for 'devil'.
