cartography
You might want to be aware of EpiInfo, a free mapping programme that
originated from the epidemiologist community.
It's free, widely-used (and therefore supported) and good.  A new release
came out just last month.  However, it's also complicated, and I
personally have never made much headway in getting the results I wanted
out of it.  I felt that to get started I needed to have a few sessions
with an EpiInfo guru, and there wasn't anyone around who used it.  Perhaps
I needed to spend more time with the online tutorials.
I wanted to do maps of India with bar graphs showing the locations and
relative numbers of MSS of certain texts.
