19th century book
I now have some digital photos of the first and last pages of the 
text.  Once the re-organisation of the website is completed, they are 
going to be placed in the Indology archive.  In the meantime, anyone 
who is interested in taking a look at them is welcome to contact me 
off-list.  There are 4 jpegs, total size 260k.
With thanks--
