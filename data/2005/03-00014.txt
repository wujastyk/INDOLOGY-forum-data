Yoga Upanisads
Luis,
Have you done or had done a search on OCLC/WorldCat by the titles of the individual Upanisads?  I see, for instance that there is one for Yogacudamni.

Friends,
I am trying to locate translations and/or editions of the so-called Yoga 
Upanisads (part of the Minor Upanisads). I am aware of the collections 
listed below, but I would like to know if there are others.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.
