Sanskrit lexical items and Pali/Prakrit sources
Dear list members,
Are there Sanskrit words not found in presently available Sanskrit 
texts/lexicons but reconstructed based Pali/Prakrit words? Are there cases where a 
lexical item was initially not found in Sanskrit texts but later the inferred 
Sanskrit word was found to occur in a Sanskrit text unavailable earlier? I would 
appreciate any references for a list of such words.
Thanks in advance.
Regards
S. Palaniappan
