Arlo,

The source seems to be the Brahmavaivarta Purana, as Marina suggested.

I translated a good portion of the passage, and discussed it, in Appendix F 
(Bhaktivedanta Swami and the 'Golden Age' within the Kali Yuga) of The 
Mahabharata and the Yugas. Peter Lang, 2002. (pp. 237-241).

The passage is 4.129.49-60. Both text and translation are included in the 
above.

Verse 51ab reads: kaleH pa?casahasrANi varSANi tiSTha bhUtale /

(Remain on Earth for [the first] 5,000 years of the Kali [Yuga]!)

This is KRSNa speaking to GaGgA.

Luis
