source of Sanskrit half-;sloka in Hindi piece
I would guess it might be:
kalau t.r.m"sasahasraa.ni vi.s.nus ti.s.thati medinyaa.m bhuutale vaa
But that is unmetrical, hence maybe emend to:
kalau tri.m"sasahasraa.ni vi.s.nus ti.s.thati bhuutale
meaning: "In the Kali [era] Vishnu will remain on earth for thirty  
thousand [years only?]"

Somadeva Vasudeva
