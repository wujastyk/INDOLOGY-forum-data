Dear Mr. Gansten,

I was aware of the discussion about the date via Roland Steiner, Marburg. Your decoding of 
the second year date as (Vikrama) year 1873 was a step forward, but to my opinion your 
calculation is questionable. Supposed, the meaning of jNavAra is indeed Wednesday ( I 
prefer Thursday, "day of the knower", i. e. B.rhaspati) and the number of the tithi is indeed 
"13", then the solution will be "Tuesday, 12th March 1816", _in case_ you have chosen a 
_current_ year, what is rather unlikely. I think, it is an elapsed year, and if this is the case, 
the result will be "Saturday, 1th March 1817". However, the real problem is the meaning of 
"suta", but I think, here it has the meaning of "soma juice" or simply "soma", thus meaning 
"1". Now we have to calculate "Thursday, the 11th tithi of the bright half of the elapsed 
?Saka year 1738" corresponding to "Thursday, 27th February 1817 CE". I hope, my solution 
is convincing.    

Best wishes

Karl-Heinz Golzio
