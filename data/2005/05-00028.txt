elves: Indic counterpart?
Joanna and others,
I did not enter the elf discussion previously because I did not think
it had any place to go. I simply do not have much interest in
European faeries, elves, gnomes and the like. But I ran across a book
on elves, faeries and company, and, out of momentary idleness, looked
at it fairly carefully. Tolkinian elves seem a bit different than the
joyful wee folk of the book, but that is only an aside. I know of
nothing in the Indic sphere that even comes close to either version.
The usual lot in Buddhism is the eight classes of gods, animistic
beings, and demons: devas,
nagas,  yakshas,  gandharvas, asuras, garudas, kinnaras, and
mahoragas.  To which one must add: apsaras, ganas, kumbhandas,
rakshasas, and the nakshatras.  Then, of course, there are all the
classifications of beings in the Mount Meru system. None of these
beings, where I know of a description of their respective behaviors,
behave in a manner anything  like the elves. Now it may be that the
Hindu systems harbor an elf-like being (perhaps the ganas of 7th 8th
century south India with their joy and musical inclinations) but even
these have a very specific iconological position (separating the
mundane from the transcendent) that has nothing to do with elves.
I am inclined to think the issue of an elf in Sanskrit is a miss and
maybe the Thai have their own animistic being, the Nat, that might
come into  play but then I do not know much about the nats either.
Cheers
John
