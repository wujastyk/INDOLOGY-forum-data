Dear colleagues,

I am happy to announce the first Leiden Indological Summer School,  
which will take place in August 2006.

Please read more about the Summer School at <http:// 
www.indologicalsummerschool.leidenuniv.nl/>, and please do inform any  
students who may be interested in participating. We believe we have a  
very stimulating (and demanding) program to offer, at relatively low  
costs. If there turns out to be a lot of interest in the Summer  
School, we may have to select students.

Please also note the possibilities for taking courses in the parallel  
Indo-European and Russian Summer Schools.
