Hamsa is Anser Indicus (bar-headed goose). Their nesting areas are in the 
Mountainous regions of central Asia north of the Himalayas. (No wonder they 
want to be in Mansarovara). They come to northern India and Myanmar during 
winter. They have light grey body, white head with two black bars on the 
back of the head. Depending on the context Hamsa can mean God, Brahma, 
Vishnu, Shiva, Soul, vital air, and individual soul. Used as Paramahamsa, 
it means ascetic of the highest order. It is depicted as a beautiful bird 
in poetry and beautiful women's graceful slow walk is equated to that of 
Hamsa. It is the vehicle of Brahma.
