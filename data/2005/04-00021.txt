Ganapati query and call for interns
There is a fairly extensive article on Ganesh in the Buddhist context
in Dina Bangdel's and my  Circle of Bliss: Buddhist Meditational Art
catalogue (catalogue entry no.152 or nearby).
I have forwarded your request for interns to two people I know in New
York, both of whom are very good young photographers.
