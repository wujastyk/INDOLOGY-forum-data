Correction in Muktabodha Fellowship award period
Dear Colleagues,
Please note this correction in the award period for the Muktabodha
Fellowship in Shaiva Tantra Studies announced earlier.
Students awarded the 2006 awards would use their fellowships between June
2006 and December 2007.
I apologize for the earlier mistake.
