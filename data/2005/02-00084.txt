Looking for a scholar (USA only, unless you can pay me in USD for the
postage) to take this book off my hands (thinning my library):

Roghair, Gene H. The Epic of Palnadu. a Study and Trans. of Palnati viorula
Katha. Oxford, Clarendon Pr., 1982.

I only need a check to cover the mailing.
Thanks
Joanna Kirkpatrick
