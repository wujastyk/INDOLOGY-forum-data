Subject: Bibliographies with BibTex,              separating primary and secondary sources
Message-ID: <161227076126.23782.10392739819332733352.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Apologies to the technically uninterested for yet another technical
question -

I'm trying to produce a LaTeX document with two bibliographies attached,
one for primary and one for secondary sources.
The package multibbl in principle achieves what I want - separating
primary and secondary sources into two different bibliographies.

My real question concerns formatting. For secondary sources, the
reference in the main body of the document and in the bibliography
expands to "Author Year" (like "Hattori 1968"), which is fine.
For primary sources, however, I'd like it to expand to an abbreviation,
as e.g. "PS" or "PSV". I thought of using this abbreviation as the key
for an entry in my BibTeX bibliography. Then I would need a BibTeX style
that prints this key, and not "Author Year", in the main text and in the
bibliography itself. So far I was unable to find an existing style that
proceeds in this manner.

I suppose that I'm not the first Indologist confronted with this
situation, and would therefore welcome any suggestions. Please bear in
mind that I'm unfortunately still a TeX newbie, and might not be able to
understand too technically phrased replies.

Thank you very much in advance, and best regards,

Birgit Kellner
