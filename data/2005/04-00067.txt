This may suggest parallels to some members of this list, as regards the use of the Indian "classics" in traditional, British, and post-independence India, and maybe even the Harappan sign system.

CFP: Hegemony and Cornucopia: Classical Scholarship and the
Ideology of Imperialism A one-day conference at the University
of Nottingham, UK,  Saturday 10 December 2005 This
interdisciplinary workshop will examine the transformation of
Western classical scholarship alongside the expansion of
European imperialism, focusing particularly on the eighteenth to
the twentieth centuries. The conference aims to bring together
those interested in classical reception with scholars of modern
empire and also with scholars of the ancient world beyond the
Mediterranean. Papers might examine the interaction of classical
scholarship, ancient history, and modern imperialism from any
disciplinary perspective.

The theme of 'Hegemony and Cornucopia' alludes to the routes by
which empires forge power from heterogeneity, imperial elites
profiting from the diversity of empire while constructing
discourses of identity and of alterity to maintain control. Was
a changing Western scholarly understanding of ancient Greece and
Rome connected to the ways in which European empires employed
and understood the variation of their constituent populations,
cultures, environments and products? How did encounters between
European and non-European traditions of 'the classical' shape
ancient historiography and modern imperialism? Subjects for
consideration could include, but are certainly not limited to:
discourses of imperialism; decadence and decay; citizenship and
slavery; public and private morality; material culture,
exoticism and imperial wealth; knowledge, science and
'development'; race and nationality; and ideas of European
exceptionalism. Diverse methodologies are encouraged.

Papers should be original and should have not been previously
published or delivered at a major conference. Abstracts should
be submitted by 30 April 2005. Successful contributors will be
requested to submit draft versions of their papers by 30
September 2005 to be considered for publication in a conference
volume.
