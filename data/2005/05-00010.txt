conjunct characters in devanagari
Max Mueller lists 248 conjunct characters in his Sanskrit grammar.  Macdonell repeats the same list; a similar list (though with some slight differences) appears in Deshpande's Primer.  Is there a standard list?  If there is, does anyone know sources that discuss its history?
Thanks,
Herman Tull
