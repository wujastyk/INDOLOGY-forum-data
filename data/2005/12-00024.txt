Knuth on Indian combinatorics
Historians of mathematics may be interested to see that the computer 
scientist Emeritus Prof. Don Knuth, Stanford, has written a short "History 
of Combinatorial Generation" in which he deals with a number of early 
combinatoric systems, including those in Pingala's Chandahsutra, Kedara's 
Vrttaratnakara, in the Prakrita Paingala, and Narayana Pandita's work.
The pre-publication fascicle is available as a PostScript file at:

Prof. Knuth will pay you a cheque if you find errors in his work.  See
