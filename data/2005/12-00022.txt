Article on Bhattikavya
      Dear Indologists,
  I am trying to track down an article in a festschrift:
  NARANG S.P., 2003. An analysis of the Prakrta of Bhasa-sama of the Bhatti-kavya (Canto XIII) (On the basis of Jayamangala and Bharatamallika). In: Prof. Mahapatra G.N., Vanijyotih: Felicitation Volume, Utkal University, Bhuvaneshwar. (in press).
  Does anyone know the email address of the author or know whether the book actually appeared in print and if so where I can get a copy? Please contact me off list if you can help.
  Many thanks,
  Oliver Fallon
