The adbuction of the lotus-flower by the king of elephants
The simile appears in the kumAra-saMbhava in the last verse of the third canto, where the mountain (himAlaya) carries home his daughter (umA) after the destruction of kAma by ziva.

"Just then the Mountain, having taken into his arms his daughter who deserved to be sympathized with and who had closed her eyes in fear of the anger of S'iva, went along his path, as does the elephant of the gods holding a lotus sticking to his tusk, with his body stretched to its full length on account of his great speed" (Kale's translation). Mallinatha says nothing about the suragaja and gives nalinIm as an equivalent of padminIm...
It is difficult to suppose that later poets could have ignored this verse...
