vaidurya
I'm sending the reply below on behalf of Sally Sutherland Goldman, who was 
unable to send it directly to Indology.

Vaidurya  can refer to either "cat's-eye beryl," or" lapis lazuli." 
Caty's-eye beryl is traditionally said to be produced on a mountain in Sri 
Lanka (Mt. Vidura).  Vaidurya is sometimes translated as emerald, which is 
a green variety of beryl. Lapis Lazuli, of course, comes largely from the 
mountains of Afghanistan  (in the region of the Kokca River). See 
Mayrhofer, 1956-1980,  vol. 3, p.267-68) and Apte s.v.  See too, notes to 
the Ramayana translation (Pollock, notes to 3.30.9, LeFeber, notes to 
4.13.5-8), (Goldman and Goldman, notes to 5.5.1.2-3,etc).
