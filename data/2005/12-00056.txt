thanks
Many thanks to all who wanted to help, especially to my unknown benefactor who subscribed me eventually to the Indology list.
I am here again at last, with a new "clean" mail-box (yavass at mail.ru).
By the way, my office postal address has changed too:
Peter the Great Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography (Kunstkamera),
3, University Emb., St.Petersburg, 199034, Russia 
With my best wishes to all of you
Yaroslav Vassilkov
