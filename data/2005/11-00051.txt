How to change subscription options (was: Re: question)
It should actually be possible to change your email address without 
unsubscribing from the list (and then have one of the committee members 
subscribe you with a different address).
The following link leads to the page for updating subscription options:
http://listserv.liv.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa?SUBED1=indology
This link can also be found on the INDOLOGY homepage, as "Quick link to 
add/remove/modify a subscription to the listserv discussion forum" on 
"INDOLOGY: core services".
To update subscription options, you have to login first. If you access 
your subscription options for the first time and have never received a 
password before, you can get one by clicking on a link on the login form.
All subscription options can be set this way, including e.g. whether to 
receive the list in digest form, or (very useful) temporarily suspending 
mail delivery during holidays.
Best regards,
Birgit Kellner
