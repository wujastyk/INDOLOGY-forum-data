e-text of Kutubana [Qutban]'s Miragaavatii
An e-text of the Old Avadhii Miragaavatii input by Joris ter Linden
(Leiden) and myself, and proofread by Dick Plukker (Amsterdam), has
been put on-line a few days ago in the text-archive of the Electronic
Resources for Hindi and Other South Asian Languages at
<http://hin.osaka-gaidai.ac.jp/>. If all goes well, this e-text will
soon be available via GRETIL as well.
