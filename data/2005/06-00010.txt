Etymology of honorific particle jI
It will seem less counter-intuitive if one
recalls not an imperative, but the Buddhist Skt expression
ayu.smant, "(long-)lived." used as an honorific
term of address throughout the Mahaayaana suutra
literature. The etymology seems sure when
one considers the Nepali form -jyuu, where the labial
of jiiv- is clearly preserved.
