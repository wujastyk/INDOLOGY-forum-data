Supernormal Powers in Ancient Indian Traditions
Dear Colleagues,
(Apologies to RISA subscribers for cross-listing)
I am working on the topic of supernormal powers ("divine" ear and 
eye, knowledge of others' thoughts, memory of past lives, and other 
siddhis/rddhis) in Indian Buddhism, and would like to situate my work 
in the larger context of ancient Indian religions, and so I am 
looking for early Jain and Hindu treatments. I am aware of the Yoga 
Sutra chapter (and commentaries on it) on vibhutis, but am interested 
in other treatments as well. I am more interested in systematic 
discussions, but sustained narratives (from the epics, for example) 
of yogins and tapasvins displaying such powers would be worth 
considering as well. Any suggested references would be most 
appreciated!
