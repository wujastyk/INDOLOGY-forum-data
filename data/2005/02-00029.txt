It is not necessary to have one font that renders both Devanagari and
diacritics in Latin text. What is necessary is to have a web browser
which can identify the different script sequences and use an appropriate
font.

I would recommend using Mozilla's Firefox to achieve this:
      http://www.mozilla.org/

If it is not already set up for you, you can adjust the font properties
to suit your choice of devanagari and diacritical fonts.

Tools > Options > Fonts & Colors
      Fonts for: Unicode (e.g., Arial Unicode; Gandhari Unicode )
      Fonts for: Devanagari (e.g., Mangal)

If you need help locating a Devanagari font David McCreedy's page may be
helpful:
     http://www.travelphrases.info/gallery/Fonts_Devanagari.html

Once the fonts are specified, one can visit Wikipedia, and with a little
luck, see both Devanagari and diacritics rendered correctly:

For example:
      http://students.washington.edu/asg/images/wikipedia.jpg
Which shows a screen shot of this page:
http://sa.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%82%E0%A4%B8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%83%E0%A4%A4

While this screen shot was made using Firefox for the PC, the same
effect is equally be possible on Mac and Linux.
