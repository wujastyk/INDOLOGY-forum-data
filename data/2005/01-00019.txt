It's really hard to read this passage. Given up for now.

ISTikApatha, alias Pathezvara, in Kashmir is on the bank of the river
PuNyodA about 20km east of the Wular Lake (MahApadmasaras),
no.136 of the map in A Study of the NIlamatapurANa, ed by Y.Ikari (Kyoto,1994).
On ISTikApatha cf. also RT 3.467 and Stein's note, besides NM 118 (de Vreese,
vs.122 in Ved Kumari) mentioned in your note.

(Sorry, I am wandering from Dr.Palaniappan's question.)

P.S. You can download digital files of GuNaratna's commentary
TarkarahasyadIpikA on Haribhadra's SaDdarzanasamuccaya and the KAzikAvRtti
(ed. by Aryendra Sharma, 1969) from http://tiger.bun.kyoto-u.ac.jp/mtokunag/skt_texts.
Both files (not proofread) are only ancillary, for the purpose of word search,
to the published texts just like my other digital files.
