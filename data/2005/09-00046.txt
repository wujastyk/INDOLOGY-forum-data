haMsagAminI
Dear Colleagues!
"haMsagAminI" is a not uncommon epithet for young beautiful women. The usual rendering is "with a swan's gait" (or similar) which sounds a little strange to Western ears, however, because in Europe the way swans, geese and ducks walk is, as far as I can see, considered rather inelegant. I presume this is the reason why at least one translation I came across has "with a flamingo's gait" instead. This seems possible, but perhaps is just wrong. I wonder if anybody is aware of an article discussing this question or has his own theory about it. Any hints would be greatly appreciated.
Many thanks in advance,
Sven
