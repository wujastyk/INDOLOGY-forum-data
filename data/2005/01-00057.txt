I am sorry to say that these three URLs are old news reports.  After my first email about the latest E-Sakal news item, someone sent these to me as latest reports, and I forwarded these to the list before checking the dates of the news items.  The E-Sakal news item is indeed the latest news item.  I checked the E-Sakal web-page again.  If someone wishes to read it in Marathi, I have saved it as a pdf file.

Subject:      Latest chapter in Jim Laine's Shivaji saga
 
Dear Indologists,

Just for your information, here is the latest chapter in the James Laine saga.  The Marathi newspaper SAKAL from Pune is reporting in its E-edition today that Udayan Raje Bhosale of Satara has filed a law-suit in the local court against James Laine and his ten Maharashtrian collaborators including Shrikant Bahulkar, Sucheta Paranjpe, V.L. Manjul, Rekha and Yashwant Damle, and Bhaskar and Meena Chandavarkar.  The judge has ordered all these 'accused' to appear before the court on April 2.  They have been charged with conspiracy to defame Shivaji and cause pain to his family.
