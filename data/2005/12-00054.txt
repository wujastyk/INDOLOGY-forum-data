Witzel's interview
Hello George,
Thanks for posting these references.  As a former citizen of the state 
of California for some 17 years, and as a former student of yours, and 
as a Vedicist trained by you and your good [now retired] colleagues 
there at Berkeley [Frits and Bart in particular], I wonder whether you 
could tell us in more detail how the culture wars re Indian history in 
California schools are going these days.  I have been involved with 
teacher-training programs here in New England re the teaching of Indian 
history & culture, and I would like to know more about your experience 
in California.
Of course, I am utterly shocked by the unwarranted violence of these 
attacks against Michael Witzel, who is as good a person, utterly, as I 
have ever known.
I hope that you can share with us your experiences there in that great 
state of California, now run by a used-up steroid-driven Austrian actor 
now playing the role of governator of the Hollywood state of California, 
so-called.
Best wishes to you,
George Thompson, still a Vedicist
