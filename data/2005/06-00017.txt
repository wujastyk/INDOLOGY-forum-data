Etymology of honorific particle jI
I remember being told something similar but not exactly the same, 
viz. that it came from jiiva, "life", "soul", so that you were 
literally saying "my father's soul said".  Not an impossible 
development, when in Sanskrit you could very well say "my guru's feet 
said..."
