Tony:

I do not have a definite reference at this very moment but it would not be 
hard to find.

Right from the Gita Govinda where Radha emerges for the first time she 
remains a consort for Krishna in the Gaudiya tradition. One sees this in the 
many pata chitras of Orissa.

In late Nathawara paintings one also sees this.

While in pushitimarg tradition there is no Radha but merely gopis.

Regrads.
