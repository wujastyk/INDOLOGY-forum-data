Dear lists, someone can kindly give me news about a certain Rathangaduta, of
which I have the Sanskrit text, published in Mumbai in 1857? It does not
appear in any lists of dutakavyas presented in also very recent studies
about the messenger-poems, like that of Lalita Sengupta (2003).
I am eagerly looking for an English or a Hindi translation of this little
(97 stanzas) work.
Thank you so much.
Daniela
