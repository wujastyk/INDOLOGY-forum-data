Oak and the Tribe of the Buddha
Is it sure that the "sisters" in question were sisters of the same lineal 
descent as the brothers? The term "sister" is sometimes not very precise 
when translating local kinships. I note from J. Silk's message that there 
must be a term for "full sisters" and "agnatic half-sisters" ....these 
latter could be daughters of a different mother same father;  or, father's 
brother's daughters would be agnatic sisters (parallel cousins). Northern 
Indian kinship forbids consanguineal marriage within 7 generations on the 
male side and 5 on the female side. But an article from The Hindu asserts 
that
"Buddhism allows first cousin marriages..." although which first cousins is 
not specified.(

)
I ask because there are and were kinship systems in India where uncles 
married their own sister's daughters (several Brahmin castes in south 
India), -- a way of sort of "marrying a sister" without doing it -- or their 
mother's brother's (maternal uncle's) daughters (cross-cousins. Parallel 
cousin spouses among Hindus are usually if not entirely taboo. These of 
course would not be referred to as agnatic.) Nur Yalman among others has 
written a lot on these preferential marriage choices. Granted, the ones he 
studied were not from northern India. However, the presence of some types of 
"sister-marriage"  in the hills is conceivable.
