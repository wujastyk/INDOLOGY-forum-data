Professor David Pingree
Friends:
I was preparing a notice for H-ASIA to share this sad news.  I came into a 
puzzle.  When wwas David born?  The LC records say 1933 which would bring 
his age in the American reckoning to 72, but I had an impression he was 
older than that.  Can anyone clarify?
Thanks,
Frank
