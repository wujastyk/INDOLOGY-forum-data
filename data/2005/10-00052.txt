a) From Prof. Harold Powers (Princeton):
"According to Professor Sambamurthy's biography, Tyagaraja was invited to 
Kanchipuram in 1834, and as a consequence of urging by disciples and other 
admirers, he extended the visit into a pilgrimage to a number of other 
places (including Madras).  It  may be (now according to  M.S. Ramaswamy 
Aiyar's biography) that on his eventual return to Tiruvaiyar he veered a 
bit westward to have darshan of the deity at Srirangam.  In any case, "O 
Rangasayi" is sung to the deity there.   If the pilgramage to Srirangam was 
part of that Grand Tour he made starting in 1834 in Kanchi, one might 
suppose that "O Rangasayi" was first sung in 1834-1835.  But  there are 
many stories about Tyagaraja's compositions, and only a few compositions 
can be satisfactorily ascribed even to a particular period of his life -- 
and that almost entirely on the basis of suppositions regarding a 
hypothetical progression from one particular attitude towards devotion to 
another.  One is therefore mightily tempted to use the invitation from 
Kanchipuram, for which there is a dated letter of invitation, as a linchpin 
date for compositions sung to deities outside of Tanjor district."
