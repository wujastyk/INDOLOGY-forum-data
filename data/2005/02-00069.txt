elves: Indic counterpart?
In Polish tradition "small people" are called "krasnoludki", which can be
translated as "little red people". It may be of interest that they are
believed to have their homes either in or near toadstools (amanita muscaria).
Any connection of rbhus, gandharvas, vidyadharas with halucinogens?
