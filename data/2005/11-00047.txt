Mystery manuscripts
Hi,
The second black paper manuscript ('parabaik' in Burmese) is Burmese. It
contains several dates from different months in ME1213 (1851CE). The top
leaf records the value of a marriage payment by husband to wife, and perhaps
this is the end of a judicial decision of some sort. The bottom leaf is a
list of settled debts.
Black parabaiks were typically used as notebooks for various jottings such
as these, rather than as supports for more literary texts.
