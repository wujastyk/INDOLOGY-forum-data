Obituary
Murray Emeneau
14 September 2005
Murray Barnson Emeneau, emeritus professor of linguistics and Sanskrit, died in 
his sleep on Aug. 29 at the age of 101, in his Berkeley home. He was an expert 
in "language areas" and the Dravidian languages of south and central India and 
founder of the Survey of California and Other Indian Languages.
Born on Feb. 28, 1904, in Lunenberg, Nova Scotia, Emeneau, a Rhodes Scholar, 
received his Ph.D. at Yale University in 1931. He worked for several years as a 
lecturer and researcher in Sanskrit at Yale, where he was heavily influenced by 
Edward Sapir, one of the greatest linguists of the 20th century. On Sapir's 
suggestion, Emeneau went to India in 1936 to work on Toda, a non-literary 
Dravidian language. He stayed in India for three years, doing linguistic 
fieldwork on the Toda, Badaga, Kolami, and Kota languages.
Emeneau was hired in the classics department at Berkeley in 1940 as an 
assistant professor of Sanskrit and general linguistics. He became an associate 
professor in 1943 and was promoted to full professor in 1946. He wrote 21 books 
and, by the time of his death, his other publications numbered in the triple 
digits.
When Emeneau first went to India, no linguistic fieldwork on the non-literary 
Dravidian languages had been done. Emeneau created this field through work that 
includes grammars of Kolami and Toda and a three-volume Kota text. Another of 
Emeneau's major achievements in Dravidian studies is the Dravidian Etymological 
Dictionary, written with Thomas Burrow and first published in 1961.
Emeneau is also generally seen as having initiated the modern field of 
"linguistic areas" in his 1956 article "India as a Linguistic Area," which was 
published in the issue of Language that honored Berkeley anthropologist Alfred 
L. Kroeber on his 80th birthday.
Emeneau's work in this field continued with studies of mutual linguistic 
influences, including a 1962 book on Dravidian borrowings from Indo-Aryan. In 
the history of linguistics at Berkeley, he mediated between Kroeber's interest 
in "culture areas" and the larger-scale areal focus of Johanna Nichols, a 
professor of Slavic languages.
He persuaded Berkeley to establish a Survey of California Indian Languages and 
a Department of Linguistics, which he chaired from 1953 to 1956. After a year's 
sabbatical, he resumed the post for one year.
The Survey of California Indian Languages later became the Survey of California 
and Other Indian Languages, indirectly succeeding the Ethnographic and 
Linguistic Survey of California established by Kroeber in 1901. "It was and 
remains an immensely significant institution for the documentation of the 
indigenous languages of California and elsewhere in the United States outside 
Alaska and Hawaii," said Andrew Garrett, acting director of the survey and a 
Berkeley professor of linguistics.
In the 1950s, '60s, and '70s, under the leadership of Mary Haas, a fellow 
student of Sapir's whom Emeneau hired, generations of graduate students 
documented words, grammatical structures, and texts in dozens of California 
languages, Garrett noted. Some of those languages have few or no remaining 
native speakers today, he added.
Now, he said, the mission of the survey has expanded to include language 
documentation throughout the United States and in other parts of the Western 
hemisphere -- as well as numerous projects designed to make the results of that 
documentation accessible to native communities in California. "It is now 
probably the most important university archive of documentary material on the 
languages of the continental U.S.," Garrett said.
Emeneau gave the Berkeley Faculty Research Lecture in 1956. On his retirement 
from the campus in 1971 he received its highest honor, the Berkeley Citation. 
Among his many other honors, Emeneau was the recipient of four honorary 
degrees, the Wilbur Lucius Cross Medal from Yale, and the Medal of Merit of the 
American Oriental Society. He was a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and 
Sciences and the British Academy, and an honorary member of the Linguistic 
Society of India. He was the sole honorary member of the Philological Society, 
the oldest linguistic professional society in the English-speaking world.
Emeneau is survived by a stepdaughter, Phyllis Savage, of Tustin. A campus 
memorial is tentatively planned for spring 2006.
