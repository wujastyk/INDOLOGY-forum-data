Etymology of honorific particle jI
I thought that Prof. Kapstein's earlier suggestion made some 
good semantic sense, and the Nepali parallel was helpful; 
nevertheless,  I had long thought that jii was derived from 
skt. aarya.  Such at least is the suggestion of Nehru's 
Discovery of India, where Pandit-ji [sic!] in a footnote 
somewhere so derives it on the authority of some Indologist 
(I don't have a copy of the book to hand, so I can't give 
the reference for the moment.)
So maybe aarya => M.I. ayya/ajja....=> jii.  I admit that 
I'm at a loss to explain the vowel here, though maybe M.K.'s 
parallel can help here.  If Nepali jyuu comes from the same 
source (rather than jiiv), and we presume an -u stem change 
(like in Apabhra.m"sa or B.H.S.), we're then just an elided 
initial away from the form...
