Smear Campaign vs. M. Witzel (III) (fwd)
Part III 
There are three Hindu groups involved closely in
the California 
proceedings. We've said a bit about them in
previous posts, so here 
I'll just give the quickest of summaries: 
1. The VEDIC FOUNDATION in Texas. Their proposed
edits to California 
textbooks are the most ridiculous of all of them.
This is no wonder, 
given their views of ancient history, which have
it (in webpages now 
largely removed) that Indian civilization reaches
back 1,972 million 
years -- over 1.7 billion years before the age of
dinosaurs.
