Sad news about Professor K. V. Sarma
I am sorry to relay to the INDOLOGY list the sad news that Prof. K. V.
Sarma has passed away.  He was 86 years old.  Many will know of his vast
erudition and his huge and critically important contribution to the
history of Indian science, especially mathematics and astronomy.
