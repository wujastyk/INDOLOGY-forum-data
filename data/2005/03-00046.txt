Valerie,
LC's email system is part of that of Congress's, which is under constant hacking assault.  Therefore various domains  though which attacks come are regularly shut off for various periods.  I now have a personal email address <alanus1216 at aol.com>. Please send me your query or a test message.  I don't know if the mainframe cuts off messages to non-LC addresses, and it would be useful to know if it does.  Unfortunately I don't have a home computer but if the test fails I can go to a computer cafe.  I will be going off the the Association for Asian Studies convention tomorrow morning and won't be back until Tuesday late, so probably won't answer you immediately.
Sorry,
Allen
