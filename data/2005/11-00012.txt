source of Sanskrit half-;sloka in Hindi piece
Dear colleagues,
A graduate student in my department is studying the following theatre  
piece by .Thaakur Jagmohan Si.mh (1857-1899): "Huqqevaale kaa  
naa.tak", published in .Thaakur Jagmohan Si.mh Racnaavalii 1. 2001.  
Raaypur: Chattisga.rh lok sa.msk.rti anusandhaan sa.msthaan (written  
c. 1880; unpublished during his lifetime).
At a certain point in the dialogue, a wise man cites the following  
half-;sloka to prove that dharma and devataas are no longer what they  
used to be:
kalaud.r.m;sa sahasraa.ni vi.s.nusti.s.thati mediniim-bhuutalecaa
The word division is as given in the text. Does anyone understand how  
to read or correct d.r.m;sa, which I presume must be separated from  
kalau? Does anyone understand bhuutalecaa, or at least the caa part?  
Does anyone know the source of this (half) verse?
With thanks,
