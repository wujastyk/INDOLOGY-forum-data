Domestication of elephant
Reminds me of the disappearance of the tiger from Korea---as with the Chinese elephant:  they probably exterminated them for food and/or medicine. The vegetarianism of most of India no doubt saved a lot of wild species. Of course, when during colonization the shooters came along, it became a different story. Still, elephants and tigers (sort of) survive in India, thank heavens.

==================================================
it May be of interest to know that elephants were domesticated in  
early China as well and that their bones appear in Shang tombs (these  
were native elephants which have long since died out or been killed off)
