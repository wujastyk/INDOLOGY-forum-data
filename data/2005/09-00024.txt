I just want to take a few moments to thank Reinhold for his generosity and 
thoughtfulness in making this article available, diacritical problems 
notwithstanding.  At the moment I have no need for the article, but the 
act of making it available is a model of scholarly generosity that points 
toward the community that , sometimes, we seem to forget exists.
Thanks Reinhold!
