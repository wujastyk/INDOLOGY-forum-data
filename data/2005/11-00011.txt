Arlo,

in brahmavaivarta purANa, there is a dialogue between
ga-NgA and kR.S.Na, in which kR.S.Na describes the
kali yuga as the following:

kaleh pa~NcasahasrA.Ni var.SA.Ni ti.S.Tha bhutale /
pApAni pApino yAni tubhyAM dasyanti snAnataH //

And also:

kaler daSasahasrA.Ni madbhaktaH santi bhutale /
ekavar.Na bhavi.Syanti madbhakte.Su gate.Su ca //

Or something like that... Sorry, I don't have the text
or exact references with me.
Hope, this helps.

Marina.
