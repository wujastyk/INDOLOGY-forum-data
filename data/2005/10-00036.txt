Many thanks to Matthew Kapstein, Patrick Olivelle, and Lars Martin Fosse for the quick and helpful responses.  The professor is primarily trained in a Great Books tradition rather than quantitative or sociological, and, while not a follower of Leo Strauss, would be inclined to think that one should at least assume at first that every aspect of a text including its arrangement is planned and carefully meant.  This would be a disrecommendation for the Penguin trans., in addition to the criticisms already given. I will however add a warning about what Steve Farmer would call the layered quality of many Indian texts.  


Gratefully,

Allen
