Indologists can use new VoIP technology to save on communication              costs
Dear Indologists,
If you need to talk to Indologists in different countries to plan a 
conference or discuss an article, you may be interested in the following new technology 
to communicate with colleagues located all over the world with virtually no 
cost.
damaka Personal Softswitch? is available for free download at 
www.damaka.com/download.htm.
The current product is in beta version and supports IM, free pc-to-pc secure
VoIP calls (upto two lines) with Call Hold, Call Waiting and Music On-hold
features. damaka has plans to release enhanced features in the next two
quarters.
You need to have Windows 2000 or XP operating system. It seems the version 
for Windows98 will be available shortly. Obviously, both parties communicating 
must have downloaded the software.
Regards
S. Palaniappan
