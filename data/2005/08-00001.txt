Subject: INDIAN JOURNAL OF HISTORY OF SCIENCE
Message-ID: <161227076630.23782.598651536299469539.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

As a member of the editorial board of the IJHS, I should like to encourage 
indologists to bear the journal in mind as a place for publishing 
contributions on any aspect of the history of science.

The IJHS is brought out by the Indian National Science Academy, India's 
premiere representative body for science.  The journal has plans for 
online publication in the future, and the editors are working hard to 
strengthen it's reputation and quality.

I attach a listing of the contents of the current issue.
