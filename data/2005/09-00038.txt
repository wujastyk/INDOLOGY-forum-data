Friends:
This is not a self-promotion, but close!! Promotion of a student!! 
Don Davis has just published a book on Indian law as practised in 
Kerala during medieval times. A great and unique book throwing much 
needed light on law as practised on the ground. It is: The Boundaries 
of Hindu law, tradition, custom and politics in medieval Kerala, by 
Donald R. Davis, Jr., Torino, 2004, 186 p.  The attachment will give 
you some idea of how to get a copy. CESMEO does wonderful work, but 
selling books efficiently is not one of them!
