article on missing Tulsidas
Sushil Bhai,
I have finally finished my other writing commitments and would like to 
focus on the article I had written you about, namely, the lack of 
understanding of Hinduism and the Ram bhakti tradition in contemporary 
world religion textbooks.  My specific focus would be on Tulsidas and 
the /Manas/.
Are you still interested?  I could have it done by the end of June.
