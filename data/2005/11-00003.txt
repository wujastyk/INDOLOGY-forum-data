Indian History job at Oxford (fwd)
NB: I am asked to add that people who read Indology should focus on the 
fact that the job is open to people in all periods, and not be discouraged 
by the "especially welcome" wording?

UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD
Professorship of Indian History and Culture
Applications are invited for the above post, tenable with effect from
1 October 2006, or such date as may be arranged. This chair was
created by means of a munificent benefaction from the Government of
India. The University interprets History and Culture widely, to
include any historical period ancient, medieval, or modern, and any
cultural field, although on this occasion applications would be
particularly welcome from scholars in the field of nineteenth-and
twentieth-century Indian history. A non-stipendiary fellowship at St
Cross College is attached to the professorship. Applications (ten
copies, or one only from overseas candidates), naming three persons
who have agreed to act as referees on this occasion, should be
received not later than Monday, 19 December 2005 by the Registrar,
University Offices, Wellington Square, Oxford OX1 2JD, from whom
further particulars may be obtained. Further particulars may also be
accessed on the Web (http://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/fp/).
