Subject: Indica-et-Buddhica.org (IeB): site update / new content
Message-ID: <161227076896.23782.17120049426357804291.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

[To H-Buddhism subscribers, I apologise for cross posting]

Dear Colleagues,

The static IeB web site has been migrated to a dynamic content
management system on a new platform. This should improve site
navigation, searching, response and availability. New material has also
been added. Notably RSS news aggregation for related material and IeB
Lexica.

Lexica is a web interface to a collection of Sanskrit, Tibetan and
English dictionaries and word lists, including Sanskrit-Tibetan
Terminology based on the `Yog?c?rabh?mi' and `Mah?vyutpatti', and
`Monier-Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary'.

At this point the site as a whole consists of:

1/. Repositorium: a content management platform providing a repository
or archive for texts, materials and lexica pertinent to the study of
Indian Buddhism, and to Indology and Buddhology in general.

 http://indica-et-buddhica.org/

2/. Catalogus Bibliothecarum: a virtual union catalogue providing
centralised access to library servers with significant Indological and
Buddhological collections.

 http://indica-et-buddhica.org/?q=node/21

3/. Lexica: a web interface giving access to definitions from a
collection of Sanskrit-Tibetan, Sanskrit-English and English-English
dictionaries and word lists.

 http://indica-et-buddhica.org/?q=taxonomy/term/32

4/. Scriptio: a publishing platform used for flagging changes to the web
site.

 http://indica-et-buddhica.org/?q=taxonomy/term/26

5/. Mechanisma: a groupware suite for coordinating group activities and
sharing information and documents.

Best regards,

 Richard MAHONEY
