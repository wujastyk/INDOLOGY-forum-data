Indica-et-Buddhica.org (IeB): site update / new content
[To H-Buddhism subscribers, I apologise for cross posting]
Dear Colleagues,
The static IeB web site has been migrated to a dynamic content
management system on a new platform. This should improve site
navigation, searching, response and availability. New material has also
been added. Notably RSS news aggregation for related material and IeB
Lexica.
Lexica is a web interface to a collection of Sanskrit, Tibetan and
English dictionaries and word lists, including Sanskrit-Tibetan
Terminology based on the `Yog?c?rabh?mi' and `Mah?vyutpatti', and
`Monier-Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary'.
At this point the site as a whole consists of:
1/. Repositorium: a content management platform providing a repository
or archive for texts, materials and lexica pertinent to the study of
Indian Buddhism, and to Indology and Buddhology in general.
 http://indica-et-buddhica.org/
2/. Catalogus Bibliothecarum: a virtual union catalogue providing
centralised access to library servers with significant Indological and
Buddhological collections.
 http://indica-et-buddhica.org/?q=node/21
3/. Lexica: a web interface giving access to definitions from a
collection of Sanskrit-Tibetan, Sanskrit-English and English-English
dictionaries and word lists.
 http://indica-et-buddhica.org/?q=taxonomy/term/32
4/. Scriptio: a publishing platform used for flagging changes to the web
site.
 http://indica-et-buddhica.org/?q=taxonomy/term/26
5/. Mechanisma: a groupware suite for coordinating group activities and
sharing information and documents.
