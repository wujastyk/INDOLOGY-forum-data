Would you consider the Sanchi stupa Vedika to be based on wood carving? Are
there other wood-based carvings at Sanchi?

Can you recommend some publications to learn more about the transition from
wood to stone carving and any indications of early wood carving traditions?

This seems to clear it up.

I was able to locate all of the images except for Pitalkhora on your
fascinating web site. Where can those be found?

Thanks again to everyone,
