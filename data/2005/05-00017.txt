conjunct characters in devanagari
I had forgotten about Ulrich Stein's remarkable conjunct list in his Itrans manual.  Thanks for the reminder.  
Incidentally, has anyone else worked with Mueller's "Sanskrit Grammar for Beginners"?  Are there known defects?  I find it a fascinating work (though decidedly not for "beginners"--at least not in this century).

  Re: conjunct characters in devanagari
  About a year ago there was a thread on this very topic that led to a
  successful conclusion a and a web site.
  Does anyone have a saved record of it?
