Yoga Upanisads
Dear Prof. Gonzalez-Reimann,
Bouy's work inspired me to edit and translate the Khecariividyaa, whose 
first pa.tala is the source of all 49 "slokas of the second chapter of 
the Yogaku.n.dalyupani.sad. My thesis is due to be published in the 
Routledge Tantric Studies Series, but probably not until next year, so 
email me off-list if you'd like me to send you the translation.
Yours,
James Mallinson
