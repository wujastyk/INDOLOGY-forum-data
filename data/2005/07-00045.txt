Ramayana and "vernacular" Sanskrit
In general Prof. Salomon's contributions on
vernacular sanskrit are of the greatest value but
they may not necessarily apply equally to all
"pre-" or "un-classical" works, especially in
view of the linguistic continuum of high standard
language (Sanskrit) and numerous degrees of
approximation apparently existing side by side
throughout the history of Sanskrit. Cf. some of
my observations in my "Socio-linguistic attitudes
reflected in the work of Bhart.rhari and later
Grammarians." In: Ideology and Status of Sanskrit
(ed. J. Houben): 157-193. Leiden: E.J. Brill,
1996.
