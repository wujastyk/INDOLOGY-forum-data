elves: Indic counterpart?
It would be most interesting to know what words the Thai translation of
Tolkien uses to describe his various mini-beings (I assume they are
mini-beings, as I've not read Tolkien). But as I understood it the Nats are
Burman, not Thai--or are Nats also part of Thai culture?
If you look at the sculptural representations of Burman Nats, they are
certainly not depicted as elves, at least the ones I saw on Mt Popa.
Yes, I find John's argument here persuasive--the elf is just not a viable
Indic concept.
