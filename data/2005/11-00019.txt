source of Sanskrit half-;sloka in Hindi piece
Thanks to Marina Orelskaya, Madhav Deshpande, Somdev Vasudeva, and  
Yuko Yokochi for responding to my query so helpfully. Alas the source  
remains untraced.
To answer Yuko's question about the context, here is what our  
graduate student writes to me (quickly translated from the Dutch):
"I would not expect too much from the context for the meaning of the  
verse. The piece is a farce with lots of dirty jokes, and the person  
citing the verse is a Bengali who is depicted as a dumb and  
unreliable figure. It may very well be his is trying to show off his  
would-be knowledge by reciting a piece of (grammatically and  
metrically) incorrect Sanskrit. But the context is this: the Bengali  
is speaking with a dumb pandit. The pandit is quite impressed.
huqqevaalaa: bai.thie - ab sab dharmm lop ho gaye - aur devtaa bhii  
cale gae - kyo.mki:
[half-;sloka]
gobarganes: haa.m, mahaaraaj! ab to sab devtaa bhi u.th gaye.
huqqevaalaa: par keval hari kaa naam hii pratyak.s hai - "harer  
naamaani kevalam".
gobarganes: haa.m, mahaaraaj aisaa hii hai.
[Then the waterpipe-smoker tells how he gave a dried out tree water  
and brought it back to life. Gobarganes declares that the Huqqevaalaa  
is an incarnation of the .R.sis.]"
I don't suppose the added verse-quarter (assuming it forms part of  
the same ;sloka) will be of much help to trace a source, at least  
none of the e-texts at my disposal yields a match for harer naamaani  
kevalam.
Best wishes,
