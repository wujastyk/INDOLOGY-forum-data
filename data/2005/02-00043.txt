elves: Indic counterpart?
aspects of yak.sa-lore seem relevant, too, particularly
associations with vegetation and wealth,
though they have a malevolent side which would
not do for Tolkein's elves (though perhaps accords
with the mythology more generally).
On this, of course, see Coomaraswamy.
And what of the vidyaadharas and siddhas, as known
in the epics? Elvish longevity and command of wonders
might incline one to favor the vidyaadharas here.
