Oak and the Tribe of the Buddha
In re Jonathan's remarks on etymology and incest:
Tibetan sources do of course repeat the tradition
that the Shaakyas maintain incetuous relations
with their sisters. They sometimes add -- and here
I'm not certain if they are following an Indian
source or being inventive -- that this explains
the derivation of Shaakya from the root shak, "to be able,"
for they proved themselves able to perpetuate their race
under circumstances in which only the "forbidden deed"
(mi rung ba'i las) was possible.
