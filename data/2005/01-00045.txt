Sanskrit Google
Google has a Sanskrit search engine now, with internet (antarajaalam)
etc. search
http://www.google.com/intl/sa/
Looks like using Itrans transliteration, with a mid-Indian
(Gujarati-Marathi-Telugu-Oriya) twist: e.g., krushna  for kRSNa
Nice picture  (chitrANi) collection...
Have fun!
