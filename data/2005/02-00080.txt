V.rttikAra of the KAvyaprakA'sa
I had always taken for granted that MammaTa is uniformly accepted to
be the author of the v.rtti portions of the KAvyaprA'sa. Does anyone
know of any infomrative scholarship, contemporary or otherwise,
suggesting other possible authors of this v.rtti? Thanks for any
information in this regard.
