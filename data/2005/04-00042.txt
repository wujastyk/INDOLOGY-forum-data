>?From parallel material in the NyAyavArttika it is clear that saMsarga here
has to be understood as a term for the body:
ekaviMzatiprabhedabhinnaM punar duHkham: *zarIraM* SaDindriyANi SaDviSayAH
SaDbuddhayaH sukhaM duHkhaM ceti. (Edition of Calcutta 1934ff)

Are there any other contexts where the body is called "saMsarga"?

Thank you very much for your help
