Subject: Hindi dissertation on Bhasa
Message-ID: <161227077009.23782.2153277475684568874.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

A patron in India is trying to locate a Hindi dissertation on Bhasa entitled in his transcription " Bhas Natakchakram me charitra vidhan ek samikshatmak addhyan," which he has no more information on.  Does anyone by chance know anything more of this?  I will be consulting the bibliographies of our books on Bhasa and various reference works on Indian dissertations, but I wondered if anyone knew offhand.  
 
An argument for the GOI commissioning a comprehensive work on Indian dissertations, preferably IMHO both paper and online.  The same for other South Asian governments.
