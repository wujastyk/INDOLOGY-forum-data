What is Salai?
Thank you
The Salai is apparently the incense tree, Boswellia Serrata, also  
known as Dhup or Salar. I wonder if Dr. Ambedkar here is confusing it  
with  the 'Saal tree, Shorea Robusta, which appears in Buddhist lore  
as the tree upon which Maya rested when she gave birth to the  
Bodhisattva, as well as the tree(s) under which the Buddha passed  
into Parinirvana. Neither is the same as the 'Saaka or teak tree,  
Tectona Grandis, apart from the fact that both Shorea and Tectona are  
valuable timber trees.
