Thanks, Valerie.  
I was thinking of blood quietly dripping from a cut, in drops.  Our poets were doubtless thinking of it spurting from a major wound in the moment of its infliction, as so graphically portrayed in miniatures, which would mean lots of little tiny droplets on the ground.
Do we need a  site somewhere where one can permanently post suggested corrections to Monier-Williams and Boehtlingk and Roth et al?

It's a mite (arachnid, of the genus Trombiidae), not an insect.  See
Lienhard, S. 'On the Meaning and Use of the Word Indragopa', in
Indologica Taurinensia, Vol. VI, 1978.  The creatures you saw in
Jahanara Park in the monsoon sound about right.
