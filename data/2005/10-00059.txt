Book reviewers sought
Dear Friends,
I have in recent years been given the responsibility for assigning 
reviewers to books on South Asian religions for the Journal of 
Religion (http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/JR/home.html). We hope to 
increase the number of South Asian reviews in the coming years, and I 
am thus always on the lookout for new reviewers.
This is a great gig for recent PhDs and/or ABDs who want to add to 
their publications; though, of course, more senior scholars who would 
like to do service to the field are also very welcome. (Note that we 
do not assign reviews to graduate students before they have completed 
their exams and become "ABD.")
So, if you (or your students) are interested, please do (or have 
them) send me a letter to that effect, including a cv and stating in 
which general and specific areas you (or they) would like to review 
books.
With many thanks,
Christian Wedemeyer
P.S. "South Asia" is meant to be fairly broadly construed here, so if 
you have specialization in South-East or Central Asia, do please 
mention this.
