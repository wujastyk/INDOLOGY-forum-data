Earliest example of Indian iconography is Kushan?
Raffaele Pettazzoni, Professor of the History of Religions at the University
of Rome, wrote in _The All-Knowing God_ (1956:124) the following line. Is it
still true that this is the earliest example of Indian iconography?
 "The standing god with three heads or faces whom we find on some coins of
the Indo-Scythian kings of Kusan (second century A.D.) is the oldest known
example in Indian iconography of historical times; from the third century
onwards the instances become steadily more numerous in sculpture.
