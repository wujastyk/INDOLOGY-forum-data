Oak and the Tribe of the Buddha
Oak? maybe its a joke (sorry)
I do not think so! Oaks grown in Europe, North America and California  
(a species called "live Oak") but not in India. My botanical  
references to India list no oaks. To be blunt, some one is making up  
something of no merit what so ever.
