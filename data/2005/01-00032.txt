Subject: A Small Query: Scientific Transcription of Sanskrit
Message-ID: <161227075723.23782.11045911466975286299.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

There is an interesting note on this in the Monier-Williams Sanskrit English Dictionary (p. xxx).  Apparently the debate on transliteration was heated, even leading to letters in the "Times."  MW notes that Sir Charles Trevelyan cleared away much of the confusion regarding transliteration in "his able minute, dated Calcutta, January, 1834."

In 1879, in his Introduction to the Sacred Books of the East (Vol. I), F. Max Mueller described in detail his proposal for a "Missionary Alphabet" (which he notes he first proposed in 1854).  The system uses some familiar diacriticals, but largely depends on italicized letters (italicized "k" for "c"; italicized "t" to represent retroflexion). Unfortunately, Madonell adopts the SBE system for his "Practical Sanskrit English Dictionary" (1924).

Oddly enough, though, Mueller's 1870 Sanskrit Grammar uses the "modern system" (with the exception of ch and chh for c and ch).
