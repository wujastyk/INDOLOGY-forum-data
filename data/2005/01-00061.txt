Diacritics in MMK, attn R. Mahoney
Dear Richard,
I see less than half of the diacritics in the online UTF-8 rendering of MMK
http://homepages.comnet.co.nz/~r-mahoney/mmk_text/mmk_01_utf8.html
Correctly represented are only:
long vowels
circumflex vowels
palatal n and s
all the rest is replaced by squares
I am using Code2000 and it seems to have problems with all utf-8 pages containing Dev. transliteration. PC, Windows 98
Any suggestions or known solutions to this issue would be appreciated. 
Thanks,
Plamen
