***********************************************************
It is my very sad duty to report the death from the complications of 
diabetes, on Friday, November 11, 2005, of Professor David Edwin Pingree, 
the internationally recognized specialist in the history of ancient 
mathematics, and head of the Department of the History of Mathematics at 
Brown University.
Pingree's scholarly contributions ranged across the ancient worlds of Asia 
and the Middle East.  He edited and translated numerous editions of texts 
on astronomy, astrology, mathematics and magic from Akkadian, Arabic, 
Greek, Latin, Persian and Sanskrit sources.  Pingree's work was not that 
of cultivation of minutiae.  Rather, he placed strong emphasis on the 
transmission of science from one culture to another, and cultural 
influence on the content and expression of scientific thought.  He 
emphasized the ways in which the recipient culture might alter the ideas 
from another culture in order to render them accessible. Pingree once 
stated "each time there is a transmission there is a transformation,"  His 
students learned paleography, codicology, Indian epigraphy, ancient and 
medieval Indian history as well as studies of the Ancient Near East and 
Islam.
Though his textual command, he was often able to employ surviving records 
of a later period and culture to reconstruct the sciences of an earlier 
one. For example, he used Greek astrology to clarify earlier Babylonian 
omen texts; 8th- and 9th-century Arabic texts to reconstruct 5th-century 
Sassanian (Persian) astronomy and astrology; and Byzantine Greek 
astronomical tables to reconstruct their Arabic and Persian sources.
He was an advisory editor for the _Journal for the History of Astronomy_, 
the _Journal for History of Arabic Science_, _Arabic Sciences and 
Philosophy_; _International Journal of the Classical Tradition_; and 
_Historia Mathematica_, and was co-editor of _Islamic Philosophy, 
Theology, and Sciences_.
David Pingree was a prolific scholar with about forty-three books and 
monographs and over 240 articles published.  Among his more recent 
published books are _The Astronomical works of Dasabala_ (Aligarh: Viveka 
Publications, 1988); _The Grahaj?ana of Asadhara together with the 
Ganitacudamani of Harihara_ (Aligarh: Viveka Publications, 1989); with 
Charles Burnett, _The Liber Aristotilis of Hugo of Santalla_ (London:
