Subject: Bhattoji Diksita's Vedaabhyaasasaara?

Hello Indologists,

     While searching on Google, I came across a reference to the text of Vedaabhyaasasaara of Bhattoji Diksita edited by R.N. Patankar.  I could not open the link to it.  I have never seen this work.  If anyone has access to it, please let me know how I can get a photo-copy of it.  Best,

Madhav Deshpande
