question
Dear colleagues,
could anybody tell me how am I to change the address  of my subscription?
My old  e-mail postbox is practically blocked by spam for many months,
I use for my correspondence another one, but all my attempts to re-address
my Indology subscription have failed. There seem to be no instructions 
for it
on the Indology homepage.
Can you help?
