In response to Jonathan Silk's comment:
if an Indian travelled, was he thereby no longer
Indian "as such"?

JayAnanda's comm. was likely composed in Xixia,
according to the colophon, but the author was
a visiting professor from abroad.

One wonders: was Foucault no longer French "as such"
when he lectured in the States?
