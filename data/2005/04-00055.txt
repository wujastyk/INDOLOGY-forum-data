Dear Colleagues,
I am having difficulty tracking down any background information to help
answer a reference query, and I wonder if anyone has any thoughts on where
I might look to find more on this topic. Any advice or assistance greatly
appreciated.

The task is to try to find out any information about the life of one
William Ward Marrett (1840-1904), the English architect who built/decorated
the Falaknuma, the palace built in Hyderabad between 1882 and 1892 for
Nawab Vikar ul-Ulmara. Marrett lived in Italy, and is said to have been
buried in Hyderabad.

That is all I know, and I don't even know what it is I don't know!
Suggestions?

Thanks for any help.
