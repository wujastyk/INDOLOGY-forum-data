Dear Colleagues,

I have seen the Indian lac insect (that produces the lac resin)
identified by various zoological names:  Laccifer lacca (= Tachardia
lacca), Kerria lac Kerr, Coccus lacca, Carteria lacca.  Does anyone
know which of these is the most recently accepted name among
zoologists/entomologists?  Or can you point me to an authoritative
source?

Yours

John Brockington
