Hello Indologists,

     While searching on Google, I came across a reference to the text
of Vedaabhyaasasaara of Bhattoji Diksita edited by R.N. Patankar.  I
could not open the link to it.  I have never seen this work.  If anyone
has access to it, please let me know how I can get a photo-copy of it.
Best,

Madhav Deshpande
