Govinda Diksita
In Raghavan's NCC, vol 6, p.198, the entry on Govinda Diksita makes 
reference to an article as follows
   For a traditional account of his life see IHQ. II.220-41.
That's the Indian Historical Quarterly.  But I've looked at IHQ 2, and 
there's nothing there about Gov. Dik.  There *is* something about him in 
vol.6, according to the global index, but - drat - those pages are missing 
from the Cambridge UL copy of IHQ that I have been working with today. 
But the page numbers given for the vol.6 reference are not 220--41, and 
somehow I don't think it's the same reference.
Does anyone know the correct reference for an article giving a trad. 
account of Govinda Diksita's life?  This Govinda is the one who was a 
minister at Vijayanagara, then to the Nayak court at Tanjore, in the 
sixteenth and early seventeeth centuries.  He wrote a work on music, the 
Sangitasudha.
Many thanks in advance,
Dominik
