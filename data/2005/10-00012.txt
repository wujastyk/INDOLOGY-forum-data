"A foreigner with no knowledge of Indian society would conclude that 
marriages in India are made not in heaven, but in newspaper inserts.
Yet, such ads are not the usual manner of fixing marriages in much of India. 
They are but recent introduction, hardly 50 years old, used in case there is 
need for a greater choice; they are used if and only if the long-practised 
tradition of arranging marriages within the extended family or the 
sub-community is not to be followed. Even today, in many communities in 
India (and Pakistan and Sri Lanka), the first preference is to look within 
the family. Intra-community and consanguineous marriages are still more 
common and it has been so for centuries. Much of India, particularly South 
India, has practised endogamy or marriages within the community for 
centuries. In many communities, preference has been given to uncle-niece 
marriages, and between cousins (mother's brother's child, father's sister's 
child). The Tamil wife calls her husband "Athan" (father's sister's son) 
regardless; and the very word for mother-in-law is "Mamiyar" (respectful way 
of addressing mother's brother's wife). A recent study had shown that of the 
100,000 children studied, 34 per cent were born to consanguineously related 
parents, and 18 per cent of these were uncle-niece marriages. In 
Pondicherry, the number of consanguineous marriages was as high as 55 per 
cent, 25 years ago."
Perhaps the texts citing so-called incestuous relations might be 
questionable as to the kin relationships of the partners in question.
