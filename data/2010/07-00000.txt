colophon, explicit, incipit, post-colophon, etc. etc.
It's all very confusing.
First question: am I right in believing that David Pingree introduced
the term "post-colophon" into Indian manuscript studies when he wrote
his catalogue of the Bodleian Chandra Shum Shere jyoti?a collection?
Second: am I right that nobody outside Indological circles (and those
influenced by indologists in the last few decades) uses the term
"post-colophon"?
Finally, here's a grid of usages:
Key: Pingree (various catalogues, starting 1984)
Tripathi: C. Tripathi, Cat. of Jaina MSS at Strasbourg
Wikipedia: see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colophon_%28publishing%29 and links.
X: no special term
Description????????????Pingree    ??? Tripathi????     Wikipedia (and
non-indologists)
Final verse
of text????????????????       X??????????????       X??????????????explicit
iti...sam?ptam???     colophon?     colophon?      X (or colophon?)
sa?vat phrase?      post-            Scribal           colophon
                                colophon       Remarks
after sa?vat
phrase                    X                  post-             X
                                                      colophon
Pratapaditya Pal uses "post-colophon" in his 1978 Arts of Nepal book
(http://tinyurl.com/37n8f2z), in the same sense as Pingree.  Perhaps
that's where David got it?
