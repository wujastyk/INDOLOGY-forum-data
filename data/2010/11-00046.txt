Dear Colleagues,

Has anyone come across this term (rudhiravar?a) outside of the war  
books of the Mah?bh?rata?

I am especially interested where it occurs as a portent of future  
violence etc. I am aware of its use in Buddhist accounts of the birth  
of Aj?ta?atru, but that is about it!

I have the w?rterbuch entry, but the information here is somewhat  
lacking in context, by its very nature.

Can anyone help me?

With All Best Wishes,
