flowers: interest in small or only in large?
Not being a "botanist" and not knowing the "technical aspects" of  
"herbaceous," I'd like to mention that in Tamil literature all kinds  
of plants/flowers, small or big, large trees, shrubs, and vines--that  
grow in the ground, fields, on the shore, in the water (dirty or  
clear), in arid land, mountain slope--are mentioned and admired for  
their beauty or for certain innate quality that helps the poet to  
convey specific ideas, I guess. And, none of the early poems is pre- 
occupied with any of the plant's medicinal quality.
Best,
