FW: [INDOLOGY] Fwd: stone-inscriptions from Sichuan
I find the animals carved there of interest. 
How intriguing. 
jpg.1 shows a rabbit between a 3-headed snake and a smug or
sitting cat or lion. The rabbit is at rest. 
jpg.2 shows a rabbit trapped & looking behind him between a tiger
and a bull (usually in Indian renditions the bull would be a prey
not a predator).
jp.3 shows a snake, a horse and a leaping deer. The horse turns
as if in attack on the deer.
There are august figures in the center of each stela but they are
different.
The animals seem to be versions of the zodiac animals.  Do the
texts relate to these illustrations?
Best wishes,
Joanna K.
