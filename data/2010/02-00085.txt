Southern pronunciations ? (Re: INDOLOGY FAQ
Dear Herman,
Dear Professor Bhattacharya,
I wonder whether it is a precise characterization
(from a descriptive linguistics point of view)
to use the words "mispronounced" and "misspelled".
In my edition of Kittel,
supposed to be an AES reprint of the 1894 edition,
both spellings are mentionned on the page 1392 :
"???????" [v?ra??si] is explained as being the same as "???????" [v?r??asi]
but some textual reference is given.
"???????" [v?r??asi] appears slightly lower on the page
and has a longer entry, also containing textual references.
The strategy seen in Kittel seems to be the contrary
of the strategy seen in the Madras Tamil Lexicon,
where ??????? [v?ra??ci] is the main entry.
(and there is a secondary entry ?????? [v?ranaci]
Additionally,
unless I am mistaken
(which can very well happen, because I know almost nothing about Kannada 
and rely on electronic transcoding tools),
A google search for those two forms shows that:
"???????" [v?ra??si] occurs approximately  677 000 times on the internet
"???????" [v?r??asi] occurs approximately  132 000 times on the internet
The "incorrect" form seems to be 5 times more frequent than the 
"correct" form.
I am convinced that this means something,
at least concerning the speakers of some Modern Indian languages
because 677 000 "incorrect" forms cannot simply be ignored
(or wiped away from the realm of "linguistic facts").
They have a massive presence in the linguistic abilities of their users
(I am alluding here to what I understand to be the topic of Morris 
Halle's 1985 article
"Speculations about the Representation of Words in Memory")
Malayalam seems to have quite a different "habitus":
We find, with Google, as of today (15th february 2010):
3 690 occurrences of ??????? [v?ra??si]
646 000 occurrences of ??????? [v?r??asi]
This is quite different from the figures for Kannada!!
What about other Indian modern languages?
