It is good to see that the British Academy &c. have kindly given
permission for these files to be publicly available. I enjoyed working
with these materials so it's pleasing that everyone now has full
access. (Although the most challenging text of all -- Christian's
Cary?mel?pakaprad?pa -- does not yet seem to be available?) I would
like to thank Dominik, Shelly, Patrick and Birgit for releasing this
material.

I would also like to take this opportunity to say that while I am no
longer with the SARIT Project I still remain open to helping with
other digital projects. If you are considering something, or if you
would just like to have a chat about possibilities, please feel free
to get in touch. My contact details can be found here:
