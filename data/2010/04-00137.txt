Cola period Tamil inscription in Sri Lanka
Dear colleagues,
On p. 9 (paragraph no. 8) of his Annual Report on Epigraphy for the
year 1909-1910 (G.O. no. 665, July '10), Krishna Sastri refers to the
then-recent discovery by "H. C. P. Bell, esq.,  Archeological
Commissioner, Ceylon" of a number of Tamil inscriptions found in ?iva
and Vi??u temples in Polannaruwa.  Krishna Sastri goes on to report
that the "only complete record of the set was a Cho?a inscription of
the 11th century A.D. and belonged to the time of Adhir?jendra".
Could anyone direct me to a published version of this record?
Thanks in advance,
Whitney
