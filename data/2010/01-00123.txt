Dialogues and Games: Historical Roots and Contemporary Models.
Monday, the 8th and Tuesday, the 9th February
University of Lille 3, France


This workshop is completely organized by the ILLC 
(University of Amsterdam) as part of the 
activities of the prgram EUROCORES 
<http://www.esf.org/index.php?id=3241>LOGICCC and 
of the informal working group 
<http://www.illc.uva.nl/medlogic/DDAHL/index.html>DDAHL. 
They are hosted in Lille by STL.

Studies in the history of logic have shown that 
the medieval traditions, both in western Europe 
and in India, have many distinctive dialogical 
and epistemological characteristics. As a result, 
they have much more in common with each other 
than they do mathematical logic of the 1950's. 
Recently, it has become apparent that these 
shared characteristics can be fruitfully modeled 
in the context of modern developments in logic, 
which are dynamic and dialogical in flavor.

We believe that investigating the common 
properties of these two historical approaches can 
advance our understanding of these philosophical 
and historical traditions with the help of recent 
technical advances in dialogical and game 
semantics and dialogue games. The purpose of this 
workshop is to bring together researchers from 
both the philosophical and technical traditions 
to provide a spring-board for collaboration and 
potential cross-discipline applications, allowing 
people working in both historical traditions, the 
Western and the Indian, to gain knowledge of 
current modeling techniques and those on the 
technical side access to new problems and 
theories to model.

The four fields that we intend to represent are:

- the dialogical tradition in logic in India 
(Claus Oetke and Marie-H?l?ne Gorisse)
- obligationes in medieval Western logic ( Aude Popek and Sara Uckelman)
- dialogical semantics and dialogue models (Luca 
Tranchini, Nicolas Maudet and Tero Tulenheimo)
- and games for dialogues and semantics (Daniele Porello and Pietro Galliani).
