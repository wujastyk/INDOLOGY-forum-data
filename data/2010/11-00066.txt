Dear Andrey,
Emmerick must have typed it, probably using the REE fonts and WordPerfect
4.2.  I believe Prof. R. P. Das received the content of Emmerick's hard
drive after he passed away.
Since it is printed in cleanly-typeset roman font, it should be possible to
get at least a first cut of the file by scanning at high resolution
(600dpi+) and using OCR.  However, this might be a violation of copyright.
Best,
Dominik
