Just noticed this mail! Correct, there's no references to "blood  
raining from above" in Sangam Literature. All the references to a  
"flood of blood" if you will, (????????  
?????; ????? ??????) are about the  
blood shed in a war.
The first reference close to "blood raining from above" is found in  
Kalinkattupparani (????????????????)  
preceding Kampan's time.
The verse is as follows:
"matakkari maruppu i?a matam pularum?l?
ma?appi?i maruppu e?a matam po?iyum?l?
katirccu?ar vi?akku o?i ka?uttu eriyum?l?
k?la mukil ce?kuruti k?la varum?l?"
??????? ??????? ?? ????  
?????????
???????? ??????? ??  
???? ??????????
???????????? ??????? ???  
??????? ?????????
??? ?????? ??????????  
??? ???????
This verse is all about the omens noticed in the Kalinga country  
(modern Orissa?) when the chola king Kulottunkan waged war against  
Kalingam.
