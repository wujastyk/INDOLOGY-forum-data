Anyone heard of a flower called "aniccam?"
Dear Whitney,
The poems don't indicate that the flower perishes, though. The  
emphasis is on its delicateness, softness, and gentleness. So I  
wonder whether the flower's "reflex" action ("to wilt" when someone  
smells it) fascinated the poet. Maybe one could find a similar flower  
somewhere -- I hope!
Thanks and regards,
VSR
