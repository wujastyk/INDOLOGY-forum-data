Well, mzybe not so cool: Sanskrit script?
Thanks with my best wishes for a happy new year! I am interested and shall be happy to read your arguments. My idea was that the Pratyabhijnaa had travelled to the South from Kashmir. I expressed my view in black and white (published) in the 70s but could not further elabporate because of other occupations. I still believe in it and in Abhinavagupta's originality in Introducing the theology/philosophy. But I shall read your arguments tho I do not have time to go for publishing my views in near future.
My Maharthamanjari was heavily damaged during shift to my present house. Could you inform where I can get a copy?
Sincerely 
DB
Re: Well, mzybe not so cool: Sanskrit script?
In response to the particular detail of Prof. Bhattacharya's reference
to Mahe"svaraananda's Mahaarthama~njarii, I argued in my (unpublished)
PhD dissertation that the lost archetype for all of the Sarada and
Kashmirian Nagari MSS of the text was written in Grantha or perhaps in
the Aryalipi of Kerala.? Despite the fact that the numerical majority
of the manuscripts of the text are from Kashmir, the work was composed
in the South, and the northern (i.e. Kashmirian) recension is an
inferior and heavily edited version of the text.
I would be happy to provide details of my argument to anyone who might
be interested,
Best,
Whitney
