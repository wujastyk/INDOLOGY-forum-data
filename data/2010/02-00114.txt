INDOLOGY FAQ. Re. Varanasi
And then there was the apparently universal habit among news 
commentators of speaking of "Ra-ZHeev" Gandhi. My theory is that the zh 
for j was borrowed from French ("jeune"), and sounded nice and exotic, 
while plain old j didn't have that same satisfying ring.
As for amriikaa , if you imagine yourself as working from the look only, 
not the sound, then it could happen, since "e" is often used by casual 
transliterators for short a ("sunder," "Inder"). And transliterators 
often work from the look; thus Urdu discussions of the thought of 
"Go-ii-thii".
This is a very enjoyable topic, it gives us all a chance to vent...
