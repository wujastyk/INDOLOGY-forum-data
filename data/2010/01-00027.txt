Well, mzybe not so cool: Sanskrit script?
Possibly, although it is always somewhat difficult to guess intentions of 
Sanskritists - if I may have this little joke.
Judging from harder facts, i.e. from concomitant religious and politicial 
changes, the Dogras re-established Hindu rule in Kashmir only after c. 500 
years of Muslim and c. 30 years of Sikh rule. It is likely that in its wake 
also the influx of Hindu texts from India proper written in Devanagari 
increased considerably, from which a local shaping, known as "Kashmir 
Devanagari", developed.

Ego ex animi mei sententia spondeo ac polliceor
studia humanitatis impigro labore culturum et provecturum
non sordidi lucri causa nec ad vanam captandam gloriam,
sed quo magis veritas propagetur et lux eius, qua salus
humani generis continetur, clarius effulgeat.
