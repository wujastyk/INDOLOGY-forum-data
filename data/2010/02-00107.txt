Southern trip of "vaaraaNasii" (Re: INDOLOGY FAQ)
I found a link to M.S.S' recitation:
http://ww.smashits.com/music/malayalam/play/songs/452/Suprabhathams/ 
9064/Kashi-Viswanatha-Suprabhatham.html
Within the first 1.23 minutes of the recitation and later around 6+  
minutes, I hear "vaaraaNasi" (???????) with the vowel  
pattern long-long-short-short, which is different from what I saw in  
the blog (??????).
I don't hear a long vowel at the end of "vaaraaNasi" maybe because of  
the smooth gliding into the next word. A word spoken in isolation may  
be mangled (or, is allowed to be mangled) in singing? This happens  
quite often in Tamil.
