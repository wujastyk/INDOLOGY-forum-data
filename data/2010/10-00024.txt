Thanks! I think nothing is available online. Our library lacks Choudhury's Biblography. But I will consult at the AS, Kolkata
Thanks again in any case.

Concerning the contents of Indian Antiquary, there are bibliographies by Sibadas Chaudhuri:

Chaudhuri, Sibadas: _Descriptive Index to the Indian Antiquary, Bombay: Vol. 1 to Vol. 62, 1872-1933_. Calcutta: Firma K.L.M. Private [for] Centre for Asian Dokumentation, 1978. (Index Asia series in humanities, 9)

and

Chaudhuri, Sibadas: Index to the New Indian Antiquary, Bombay, 1938-1947. Calcutta: Centre for Asian Dokumentation, 1977. (Index Asia series in humanities, 8)

hope it helps
