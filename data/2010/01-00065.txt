The interface unfortunately doesn't offer the possibility to download 
several pages at once (as a PDF, for instance), no.
There is a workaround, but it's a bit time-consuming:
1.) Click on a page image with the desired size ("large", for instance). 
You see the JPG file and get a link like this in the browser's URL line:
http://bibliothek.bbaw.de/thumbnail?band=07-abh/1844&aufloesung:int=2&img=DAS_jpg/07-abh/1844/jpg-1000/00000002.jpg&seite:int=2
This means that the image file is stored in this directory:
http://bibliothek.bbaw.de/DAS_jpg/07-abh/1844/jpg-1000/
2.) If you have the wonderful little tool wget installed, run
wget -r http://bibliothek.bbaw.de/DAS_jpg/07-abh/1844/jpg-1000/
from the command line.
This gets you all images for the volume in question to a local folder. 
You can then create a PDF file with these images (even run OCR on them 
before), with, for instance Adobe Acrobat Pro (on Windows); I gather on 
a recent Mac OS, there should already be tools available in the 
operating system for the job.
I trust the real geeks on the list can provide further advice :-)
Best,
