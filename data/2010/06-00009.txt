Query on vol.44 of the Harvard Oriental Series:
Subhasitaratnakosa: An anthology of Sanskrit court poetry
(Harvard Oriental Series, vol.44; Unesco collection of
representative works, Indian series) [Import], Vidyakara
(Author), Oxford U.P (1965). 
Amazon.com lists this title as currently unavailable.
I assume that, as Ingalls said earlier on (in his article, A
Sanskrit Poetry of Village and Field: Yoge?vara and His Fellow
Poets. Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 74, No. 3,
Jul. - Sep., 1954, pp. 119-131) this was the volume to be edited
by DD Kosambi together with VV Gokhale.
Does anyone know why it has become unavailable? and/or if it is
allowed by some US university library to travel on ILL?
Thanks for any help.
Best wishes,
Joanna K.
