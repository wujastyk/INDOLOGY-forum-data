"And then there was the apparently universal habit among news 
commentators of speaking of "Ra-ZHeev" Gandhi. My theory is that the zh 
for j was borrowed from French ("jeune"), and sounded nice and exotic, 
while plain old j didn't have that same satisfying ring."

The same is fairly common in pronouncing "raja" and "maharaja."  Indeed, perhaps the zh sound in "Razheev" is a transfer from these words.
