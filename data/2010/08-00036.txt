URL for the Online New Catalogus Catalogorum
Dear Indologists,
     Previously, the URL (http://results2.ap.nic.in/general/s1/index.html) used to open the website of the online version of the New Catalogus Catalogorum, but it is no longer opening.  Does anyone know a functioning URL to get to this website?  Thanks for your attention.
