Email attachments (was Re: [INDOLOGY] Theories of light,              vision or optics)
This seems an opportune moment to raise a point that was discussed in the
INDOLOGY committee a few months ago, but that we haven't yet acted upon.
The committee wishes to allow attachments to postings in this forum, at
least for a trial period.  Times have changed, disks are bigger, and
INDOLOGY's members are now selected, which should prevent giant postings
from advertisers.  Job postings are welcome, and no longer have to be
converted to unformatted text.  Images can be posted.
And we can all enjoy the benefit of seeing Allen's intriguing bibliography!
As of now, therefore, attachments are permitted.
