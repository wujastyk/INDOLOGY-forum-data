Brahmins as Musicians
Dear Indologists,
I am interested in the history of orthodox Brahmins performing as musicians. Today the field of Carnatic music is dominated by South Indian Brahmins. South Indian Brahmins' involvement in music is traceable at least up to Madhava Vidyaranya. An early epigraphic record praising the musical ability of a Brahmin is that of the Western Chalukya king Somesvara of 11th century in Yewur in Karnataka . However, there does not seem to be any widespread brahmin participation in musicmaking at that time. Jayadeva comes a century later. I would like to know if the Bhagavatapurana and especially the Gitagovinda have anything to do with increasing Brahmin participation in musicmaking? 
Thank you in advance for any comments or references.
Regards,
Palaniappan
