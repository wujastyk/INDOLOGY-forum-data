the koti
Dear Colleagues,
The Aryabhatiya (499 AD) actually defines koti as the 7th power of ten in chapter II (Ganita) 2, which enumerates the successive powers of ten, from one (= ten to the power of zero) : eka.m da'sa ca 'sata.m ca sahasramayutaniyute tathaa prayutam / ko.tyarbuda.m ca v.rnda.m sthaanaat sthaana.m da'sagu.na.m syaat //
