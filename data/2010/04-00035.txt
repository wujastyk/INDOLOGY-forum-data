Dear Patrick,

I hope you've had a happy Easter.

The three of us---David Shulman, Yigal Bronner, and myself---are nearing 
the end of our work on a two-volume set of essays offering a new look at 
the history of Sanskrit kavya literature, focussing on the theme of 
innovations and turning points.  It came out of a year-long workshop in 
residence at the Institute of Advanced Studies in Jerusalem in 
2003-2004, followed by a couple of summer academies.  We're now at the 
point of looking for a publisher, and naturally we wonder whether you 
might consider including this in your series.  A table of contents is 
attached.  Please let us know your thoughts.  We three are together in 
Chicago for the Spring Quarter and except to have everything done by the 
end of the June.

Yours,
Gary.
