Dear Philipp,

It might be worth looking at initially manipulating your material in a
simple unicode encoded text file and only later -- once you're happy
with what you have -- transfering the material to a RTF file. You
might also find this Perl script useful. It will run under any system
with Perl and the Sort::ArbBiLex module.

 Sort utf-8 Sanskrit
 Arbitrary lexicographic sorting: Sort UTF-8 encoded Romanised
 Sanskrit.

One directory up there is also a script for sorting Wylie
translit. Tibetan.


Kind regards,

 Richard
