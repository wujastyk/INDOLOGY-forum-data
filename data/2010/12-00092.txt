Nirukta of anugraha?
Dear colleagues,
Thank you for your replies. To clarify, I was wondering how the original
literal verbal sense of anu+grah "to follow in taking" came to mean "to
treat with kindness," since the semantic shift does not seem logical. To
this end, I was asking if anyone had seen a nirukta of anugraha, but alas it
seems that no-one has.  But thank you to Mr. Dipak Bhattacharya for a sound
postulation (below).
best,
Chris Wallis
