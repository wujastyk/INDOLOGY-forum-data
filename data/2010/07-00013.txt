Now this really does seem like magic.  By changing the single command

   - \setdefaultlanguage{sanskrit}

to

   - \setdefaultlanguage{english}

the mini-edition that was in N?gar? now appears in roman transliteration.
It's pretty astonishing.

Of course, it isn't the language that's changing, just the writing system.
So the command should be something like \setdefaultscript rather than
...language.  But never mind that, for the time being.  It's a proof of
concept.

For an image of this, see,
