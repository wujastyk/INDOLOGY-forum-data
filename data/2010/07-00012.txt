Dear Timothy,

Yes (I presume you don't mean my typo, "v?rsena"), e.g., 4 is where the
Somdev Vasudev's RomDev mapping is used.  Here's the procedure.


   1. The actual mapping file is published by Somdev in his blog, here:
   http://sarasvatam.blogspot.com/2010/03/updated-teckit-romdev.html
   2. Cut and paste this text, and save it in a Unicode file called
   RomDev.map.  Save that file in a place which XeTeX can "see," e.g.,
   something like local/texmf/fonts/misc/xetex/fontmapping/
   3. You now need to compile the human-readable *.map file into a binary
   *.tec file, so that XeTeX can read it directly.  This is done by the program
   Teckit<http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&cat_id=TECkit>,
   which you can get here:

   http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&item_id=TECkitDownloads
   4. I'm working with Ubuntu GNU/Linux.  For me, the command is,
   *teckit_compile RomDev.map -o RomDev.tec
   *
   I'm afraid I don't know the Windows or Mac command invocation.
   5. Now you have a file in a place like
   local/texmf/fonts/misc/xetex/fontmapping/RomDev.tec
   6. Run the command that rebuilds the database of files that TeX knows
   about.  In Linux it's
   *sudo mktexlsr*
   7. That's it!  XeTeX can now see, and make use of the RomDev mapping,
   that converts Unicode transliteration into Devan?gar?.

Best,
Dominik
