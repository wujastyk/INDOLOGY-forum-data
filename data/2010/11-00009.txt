Enquiry with regard to colour symbolism in Hindu Traditions
I highly recommend the study
Damais, Louis-Charles: ?tudes javanaises. III. A propos des couleurs symboliques des points cardinaux. In:  Bulletin de l'Ecole fran?aise d'Extr?me-Orient. Tome 56, 1969. pp. 75-118.

[I myself have a problem downloading articles from this site recently, and got a blank file when I tried this one a few months ago; hopefully that problem is resolved now; in any case, the article can be consulted and searched online.]
It is presented as an '?tude javanaise', but in fact contains many properly indological data, and in any case, the Javanese tradition is equally a Hindu Tradition.
