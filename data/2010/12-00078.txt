Date of usage of the word Bhaarata to denote India
We may note additionally in this discussion that according to Maitr?ya?i Sa?hit? 2.6.6 and Taittir?ya Sa?hit? 1.8.10.1-2, in the R?jas?ya ceremony it is announced, ?This is your king, Bh?ratas,? on which Heesterman in his book on the R?jas?ya (1957, 70) notes that ?pastamba ?rautas?tra annotates "Bh?ratas? as ?respectively Kurus, Pa?c?las, Kuru-Pa?c?las, or simply people.?  ?pastamba would thus seem to take ?Bh?ratas? as the default name that covers these janapadas or the ?people? of at least these, and possibly other, territories. It would seem that the Mah?bh?rata is probably the first to then link this name with Bh?ratavar?a as a still larger people-and-land, and not through Sud?s but through ?akuntal??s son Bharata. This could make it interesting that A?oka and Manu do not use the term.
