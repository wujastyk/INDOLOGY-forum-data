Utopia / Dystopia
Here's an excellent article that contains information relevant to  
your query, but it is not in English (so, may not be instantly  
helpful to many readers):
http://www.viruba.com/tamilwritings/00001.aspx
It covers the contents of a lecture by Dr. V.C. Kulandaiswamy, a  
highly respected academic and author. Here's a link to Dr.  
Kulandaiswamy's profile on Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ 
V._C._Kulandaiswamy
I'm CC'ing him on this mail, just in case you would like to get in  
touch with him.
Best.
