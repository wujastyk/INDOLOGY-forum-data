Bhajan Lal MSS dealer
Re: [INDOLOGY] Bhajan Lal MSS dealer
Not so! One such prprietor who, as I heard,?had kept their mss with the VVRI were the Lal Chand Trust who later took them back?into their own premises at Delhi. VVRI was given?the right to use them. There was no question of anything going back to Lahore.?The entire Hindu population had crossed over to this side of Panjab. As for the said Bhajan Lal I do not know anything.

Re: [INDOLOGY] Bhajan Lal MSS dealer
Are you referring to the MSS that are today in the DAV College, Chandigarh?
I am not aware of any VVRI MSS having gone back to Lahore after partition.
An important collection of Sarada MSS was given (sold?) to the VVRI in the
1930s by Dr Paira Mall, who lived in Amritsar, and also bought MSS from
Bhajan Lal, I believe.
