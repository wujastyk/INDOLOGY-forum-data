Date of usage of the word Bhaarata to denote India
Thanks for the note! I am reminded of an incident in this connection. Long ago, a Turkish student of Sanskrit had told me that?one of the terms denoting spices was baarat??in mainland Turkey. He asked me if there was any connection with India. I was somewhat surprised because the word was not known to me as having been of?popular?use before the modern age.. But, before I could complete my enquiry, the student?was called back to Turkey. He had to go back leaving his studies incomplete and I gave up the investigation. Could anyone throw light?
Best wishes for all

We may note additionally in this discussion that according to Maitr?ya?i Sa?hit? 2.6.6 and Taittir?ya Sa?hit? 1.8.10.1-2, in the R?jas?ya ceremony it is announced, ?This is your king, Bh?ratas,? on which Heesterman in his book on the R?jas?ya (1957, 70) notes that ?pastamba ?rautas?tra annotates "Bh?ratas? as ?respectively Kurus, Pa?c?las, Kuru-Pa?c?las, or simply people.?? ?pastamba would thus seem to take ?Bh?ratas? as the default name that covers these janapadas or the ?people? of at least these, and possibly other, territories. It would seem that the Mah?bh?rata is probably the first to then link this name with Bh?ratavar?a as a still larger people-and-land, and not through Sud?s but through ?akuntal??s son Bharata. This could make it interesting that A?oka and Manu do not use the term.
