Dear Victoria,

utf-8 is the standard unicode encoding designed to handle all languages and 
scripts. The Beijing webpages (and all the others mentioned) are already 
using utf-8 to encode the romanized Sanskrit (and Chinese). When a webpage 
is properly set up, it embeds hidden instructions to tell the browser which 
language-set to use. The Beijing webpages lack that setting, so one has to 
do it manually oneself when accessing the webpage.

Depending on which browser you use, you can alter the encoding that the 
browser uses to read/decode a webpage.

If, for instance, you are using Firefox as your browser, then under the 
"View" menu, select "character encoding" which will display a list of 
language types and character sets. Simply choose "UNICODE (utf-8)" and the 
page will reload with the Sanskrit and Chinese readable. The procedure 
varies slightly with different browsers, but that's the basic idea.

Incidentally, there is a complete English translation of the AKB by Leo 
Pruden, unfortunately taken from Vallee Poussin's French version rather than 
the original Sanskrit or Chinese texts (and Pruden mistranslated the French 
at times).

Still usable, but a better, more critical translation would be nice.

best,
Dan
