We invite proposals for papers that consider such questions as the

This conference will explore the written languages of Russia and Inner 
Asia. The focus will be both historical, examining the way in which 
methods and tecniques are consciously continued, and contemporary, looking 
at how written languages are learned now, in an era of globalization in 
which new ways coexist with tradition.
  A particular attention will be paid to folklore and literature of peoples 
of Siberia and Inner Asia: genesis, typology, tradition, and innovation.
  Monuments of writing systems as historical, archeological, and 
ethnographical resources.
  Alphabet: history, genesis, and temporary conditions.
  Tuvan written language and its role in the development of the language, 
education, and Tuvan culture.
  Questions of sociolinguistics, museum studies, and other 
interdisciplinary/
The conference will create intellectually coherent panels and discussion 
groups so that scholars from different fields can engage productively 
around a central theme or question.
