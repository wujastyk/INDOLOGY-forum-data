Dear List Members,
we are happy to announce yet another issue of the Electronic Journal  
of Vedic Studies.
This important paper presents evidence for some of the earliest post- 
Indus Indian art, exported to and copied in Central Asia from the  
mid-1st millennium BCE onward. The art motives are traced back to  
Indian tales as well.
