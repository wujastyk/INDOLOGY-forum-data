INDOLOGY FAQ. Re. Varanasi
Ashok,
I should have been clearer.  I was referring to the way that native 
speakers of English often pronounce the name of the city, Varanasi.  And 
I had two features in mind: the stressing of the penultimate syllable, 
and the related pronouncing of the vowel in that syllable as more like a 
Sanskrit long "a" than a Sanskrit short "a".  By "more like" I'm 
thinking of quality more than quantity.
