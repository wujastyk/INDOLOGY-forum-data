A "Hindu Prodigal Son?"
Dear Indologists,
A colleague of mine has asked whether Hinduism, or another Indian religion, 
records a story that runs parallel in any way to the parable of the prodigal 
son (Luke 15: 11-32), in addition to the parallel that may be found in the 
Saddharmapu.n.dariika Suutra.
Any suggestions on- or off-list would be most appreciated.
Sincerely,
John
