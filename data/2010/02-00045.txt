Digital Sanskrit corpus and dictionary
Dear colleagues,
I would like to announce that a digital corpus of lemmatized Sanskrit texts
is now available at
http://kjc-fs-cluster.kjc.uni-heidelberg.de/dcs/
The corpus contains more than 2.500.000 manually annotated entries. It
offers the possibilities to search for lemmata and collocations and presents
lists of referenced finite and infinite forms of each verbal lemma contained
in the lexical database. In addition, the corpus makes it possible to
examine the distribution of lexical units over the time using basic
statistical measures.
Best,
Oliver Hellwig
