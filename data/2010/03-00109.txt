Anyone heard of a flower called "aniccam?"
Aruppalam might be from aruphala.  Aru, according to Apte, is "rakta khadira," but unfortunately he doesn't define it.  Kittel says it is a plant and says it is "me?asige," but that is not defined either.  Khadira by itself is acacia catechu, and rakta khadira might be an acacia tree with red flowers.  Acacia arabica (which is native to India)?  (see http://www.exogarden.nl/palmzaden/images/acacia-arabica.jpg).  The leaves of this are small, gentle and fernlike and could possibly be said to retreat when touched.  In any case, this is all speculation -- it points up how difficult it can be to identify botanical names in old Indian texts.  
For a list (with pictures and recitation) of the flowers in the Ku?i?cipp???u (63-95), see

This is a wonderful website and gives some very useful information.  Unfortunately, it does not give names in Sanskrit and other Indian languages, but it does give Latin names and so can be used if you know the botanical name of a flower.  George Hart
