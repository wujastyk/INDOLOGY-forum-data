Abhidharmakosha in e-format
yes, Paul, but if you save the html page after you've set your browser to 
read that page as utf-8 encoded, it should save that setting in the file, so 
that when you subsequently open the html file on your harddrive with your 
browser you won't have to fuss with the encoding settings any further; it 
will automatically open in properly readable format.
If anyone feels adventurous, and is willing to share the results, please let 
the rest of us know!
best,
Dan
