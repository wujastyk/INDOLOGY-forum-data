Could the future Sankhacakravarti please stand up?
Dear members of the Indology list,
I am working on Prabh?candra's *Prameyakamalam?rtanda* and this author, as
well as other Jain and Buddhist authors (notably Siddhasena Div?kara in his
Ny?y?vat?ra and Moks?karagupta in his Bauddhatarkabh?s?) are using the
expression "Sankhacakravarti" to denote a future agent (especially in the
argument of the three times).
Unfortunately, I have not managed to find any tracks of this
Sankhacakravarti neither in Jain mythology, nor in Buddhist cosmology.
May I ask you if anyone have heard about such a character?
If it might be of some help, the one standing for past agents in the *
Prameyakamalam?rtanda* is R?vana.
Thank you very much!!
Best regards,
Marie-H?l?ne Gorisse
