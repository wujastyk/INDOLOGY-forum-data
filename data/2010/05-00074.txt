I recommend "BatchDownload" -- a Firefox plugin.  It allows you to 
specify a base URL and auto-increment image numbers.  It works on 
complex URLs and allow for file renaming (necessary if the image 
files are being served from a script). See:

http://panshisoft.cn/batchdownload.htm

It works on both Mac & PC platforms.
