Skanda Purana 70-71
Dear List,
Does anyone have a copy of K???apras?da Bha??ar??'s edition of the early Skanda Pur??a, chapters 70-71, that they might be willing to scan for me? My copy of this text appears to be missing these chapters for some reason. Chapter 71 deals with the myth of ?arabha and Narasimha, I believe. I am missing from 70.59 to the end of chapter 71. I would be grateful if anyone could provide this for me off-list. 
Best Wishes,
Benjamin Fleming
