DIGITAL RESOURCE> Update on Philologica Indica et Buddhica
Dear Colleagues,
Many of you know that for some time I've been working on the
development of the SARIT Project. I've enjoyed this work but it's
meant that the growth of Indica et Buddhica has been slower than I'd
like.
Now, having recently released Christian Wedemeyer's
_Cary?mel?pakaprad?pa_, I'll be leaving the SARIT Project at the end
of this month. This will free me to devote more time to Philologica
Indica et Buddhica, a textual analysis platform online since mid 2006:
 Philologica Indica et Buddhica
 http://philologica.indica-et-buddhica.org/top.shtml
Philologica already provides a variety of texts for Classical Indian
and Buddhist Studies:
 Philologica Indica et Buddhica :: Digital texts available
 http://philologica.indica-et-buddhica.org/available.shtml
The emphasis will now turn to publishing digital editions reflecting
recent developments in text critical reasearch. The aim is to make
editions that currently appear in print or are embedded in doctorates
freely available.
Interested authors, editors and publishers are asked to contact me for
details.
Best regards,
 Richard Mahoney
