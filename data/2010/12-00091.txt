Nirukta of anugraha?
The sense of ?favour? in anugraha ? anu-g?h originally ??to accept subsequently?, cf., Kau?ika S.56.14 --does not appear to be old, at least not Vedic. The sense of favour could have grown by way of its employment as an antonym of nigraha ?obstruction? Y?ska, N.1.3, ?rebuke?, ?tormenting?, Ny?ya-S. 1.2.20. The pair of antonyms may be found the Bhakti and Pratyabhij?? literature.

[INDOLOGY] Nirukta of anugraha?
Dear esteemed colleagues,
In an inquiry apropos to the holiday season, I wonder if any of you have
ever seen a nirukta or nirvacana of anugraha, explaining its derivation,
since there is no obvious connection (that I can see) between anu + grah and
the meanings of anugraha.
thank you,
Chris
