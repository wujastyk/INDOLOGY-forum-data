e-text of siddhas=?utf-8?Q?=C4=81ra?=
Dear list members!
is anyone of you by any chance aware / in possession of an e-text of Siddhas?ra? (I'm thinking of preparing one, it would be a pity, however, to double someone's work --- there are so many other important texts awaiting digitalization)
Thank you in advance
and with the best regards
Andrey Klebanov
