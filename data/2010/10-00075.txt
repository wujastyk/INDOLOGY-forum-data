Dear Professor Chevillard,
Of course you are rightt in both postings. No rigid framework was claimed by me. That is dangerous in mythological enquiry. Moreover, to the proponents the original number may be real. See Mao-Tse Tung, how he has tried to prove the universality of duality with opposing or complementing components. And Gonda - in his zeal to disprove Dumezil's idea of the reflection of social reality he saw triads as universal and self existent. They work in fields where these are real and the detached reasearcher cannot penetrate into that.
I hope the lecture has not been too long.
Best
DB

Post-Scriptum:

Of course, since I personally find the idea that anyone might want to slaughter "Three thousand seven hundred goats" AND/OR "thirty seven buffaloes" UNBEARABLE, I have to make the assumption that MY HIDDEN INTENTION in making this post is to prove that the mistake in the addition (/id est/ the fact that 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9 and 37 are NOT EQUAL) definitely PROVES that such sacrifices never took place (otherwise they would have noticed that there was a mistake in the addition).

But unfortunately,
I know that this is just wishful thinking :-((

>> The origin of mythological numbers may lie in the same urge to aver completeness/fullness but post-substratum ramifications may be caused by various and apparently unrelated causes. One possibility might lie in the addition of 1 (Gonda Triads) by way of adding greater weight. 36 is the original number conceived somewhere and sometime as a basic number of completeness got by increasing by 1 from 1 up to 8. 37 is just greater.? The cakras are 7 in the ??kta tantras but are termed ?a?cakra - the original appellation in the Buddhist tantras where they are actually six in number (D.Bh.1979) to which 1 is added in the ??kta tantras. The retained appellation shows the origin.

This has long seemed to me to be some sort of convenient fiction used to tie up loose ends (not unlike the twelve disciples of Jesus recalling the twelve tribes of Israel). However, as I sat in an introductory Buddhism lecture today, and was reminded about the famed 18 schools of the Mahasanghika(s), I started to think, there might be a bit more (or, perhaps no more at all). Thanks.
