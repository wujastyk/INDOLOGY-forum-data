Dear Professor Chevillard,
Of course you are rightt in both postings. No rigid framework was claimed by me. That is dangerous in mythological enquiry. Moreover, to the proponents the original number may be real. See Mao-Tse Tung, how he has tried to prove the universality of duality with opposing or complementing components. And Gonda - in his zeal to disprove Dumezil's idea of the reflection of social reality he saw triads as universal and self existent. They work in fields where these are real and the detached reasearcher cannot penetrate into that.
I hope the lecture has not been too long.
Best

Post-Scriptum:
Of course, since I personally find the idea that anyone might want to slaughter "Three thousand seven hundred goats" AND/OR "thirty seven buffaloes" UNBEARABLE, I have to make the assumption that MY HIDDEN INTENTION in making this post is to prove that the mistake in the addition (/id est/ the fact that 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9 and 37 are NOT EQUAL) definitely PROVES that such sacrifices never took place (otherwise they would have noticed that there was a mistake in the addition).
But unfortunately,
I know that this is just wishful thinking :-((
