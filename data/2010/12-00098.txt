Nirukta of anugraha?
The intuition might be clearer if, instead of
trying to wrap one's head around "to follow in
taking," whatever that means, one considered instead,
"to take into one's following," i.e. "to accept" [as
a disciple, petitioner, etc.]. Viewed this way,
the semantic drift to "kindness" seems to me to be
quite unproblematic.
