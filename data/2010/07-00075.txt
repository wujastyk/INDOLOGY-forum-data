AttagadhaM padmam
Dear list members,
in the kavya I'm working on (Buddhaghosa's Padyacudamani) there's a 
reference to the god Brahma taking the fragrance away (and the pride 
down, with double-entendre) from the lotuses:
tadAnanenduM bhuvi niHsapatnaM
nirmAtukAmena pitAmahena /
akAri padmaM dhruvam Attagandham
antaHkalaGkaM ca sudhAMzubimbam //
(the stanza describes queen Maya, the mother of Siddhartha)
"It was surely out of his wish to make her [the queen's] moon-like 
face unequalled in the world that Brahma deprived the lotus of its 
fragrance [and: took its pride down], and marked the moon disk with 
the spot"
I've never heard of Brahma humiliating lotuses: does anyone know what 
the poet refers to?
Thank you in advance for any suggestion.
Best regards,
Marco Franceschini
