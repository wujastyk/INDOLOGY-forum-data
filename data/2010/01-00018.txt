Well, mzybe not so cool: Sanskrit script?
Re the Kashmir situation: In the 70s or 80s I purchased, new, biscriptal editions of the Gita and several other Sanskrit religious classics published in Kashmir in Nagari (from the 'front') and Perso-Arabic (from the 'back').  I donated them to LC but a quick search doesn't succeed in pulling them up.
Also, we were once offered for sale a large collection of Munshi Nawal Kishor Press imprints, among which were Sanskrit classics in Perso-Arabic script; at least, I assume they were in Sanskrit rather than in Urdu translation.
