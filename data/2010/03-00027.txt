The verse seems to express a composite coceptualization suitable to the
needs of a specific work or genre. The following verses have its ideas but
not exactly the same configuration:

aak.sepe.su samaadhaana.m vyaakhyaana.m pa;nca-lak.sa.nam //
Variant for the second half noted in Nyaaya-ko;sa p. 828: aak.sepo 'tha
samaadhaana.m vyaakhyaana.m .sa.d-vidha.m matam //. The same source
attributes the verse to Paraa;sara Puraa.na adhyaaya 18, but I am sure that
it occurs in other works, especially scholastic works.

Miimaa.msaa and Vedaanta works.
