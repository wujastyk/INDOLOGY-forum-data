Invitation for Contribution in the Volume on "Persian in              Kashmir"
Dear Mrinal,
many thanks for your kind invitation. Unfortunately, I do not  
specialize in Persian, so I cannot participate.
I still regret very much that we could not accommodate you with us:  
too much competition. But perhaps we can cooperate in the future,  
e.g. on Pandits' rituals:  how do you keep up with them outside  
Kashmir proper?
With my best wishes,
M. WItzel
