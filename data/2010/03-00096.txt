Anyone heard of a flower called "aniccam?"
This reminds me that in the hills in the South today one finds plenty  
of Mimosa pudica, whose leaves temporarily fold up the second that you  
touch them, or indeed blow on them.
But I am not sure how long these plants have been growing there, for  
the Pandanus website (http://iu.ff.cuni.cz/pandanus/database/),
quoting Dymock, Warden, Hooper: Pharmacographia Indica, vol. I, pp.  
538-539, calls Mimosa pudica a "native of Brazil long naturalized in  
India".
