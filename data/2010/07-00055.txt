Does anyone have easy access to a copy of

*Catalogue of manuscripts and books belonging to the Bhau Daji memorial :
Prepared unter the superintendence of the honible Rao Saheb Vishavanath
Mandlik ... and Ardasur Framjee Moos* ... (1882).

i.e., entry #31 in Janert's Annotated Bibliography of catalogues, or #0113
in Biswas's Bib. Survey Ind. MSS Cats.?

I can find copies in the BL, London and the Staatsbibliothek, Berlin, and
Biswas mentions some in India.  I can't find any digital copy (DLI,
archive.org).

Thanks,
Dominik Wujastyk
