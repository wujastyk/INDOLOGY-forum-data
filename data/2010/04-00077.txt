Crow lore
A follow-up to Matthew's observation: although 
Laufer wrote his article based on a Dunhuang 
manuscript (Pelliot 3530), the text (bya rog gi 
skad brtag par bya ba; kAkacaritra) is actually 
contained in some recensions of the Tibetan canon 
(Peking: P5831, vol.144, p.25-27, vol. GO fol. 
202b7-204b6; and Snar-thang: thun mong ba lugs 
kyi bstan bcos, vol. GO, fol. 221a1-222b7, to 
name two).
[BTW, the citation for the Laufer article is: 
Berthold Laufer, "Bird Divination Among the 
Tibetans," T'oung Pao (II) 15 [1914]: 1-110. The 
article is available from JSTOR.]
A more up-to-date study however, can be found in Eric Mortensen's dissertation:
"Raven Augury in Tibet, Northwest Yunnan, Inner 
Asia, and Circumpolar Regions" Harvard (2003).
There are several more texts related to "bird 
divination" in both the Bka'-'gyur and 
Bstan-'gyur sections of the Tibetan Buddhist 
canon.  If you are interest in references to 
those, feel free to contact me off-list.
