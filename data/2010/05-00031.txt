Invitation for Contribution in the Volume on "Persian in              Kashmir"
Dear Mrinal  Kaul,
Thank you very much for your kind invitation to contribute the volume  
on the contribution of Kashmiri Persianists to Persian literature.  
While my work does include the study of some technical morphological  
aspects of "Persian" (Parthian, Sasanian and Early Arabo-Sasanian)  
art, I neither know Persian nor do I have any scholarly interest in  
the literature. Therefore, I have nothing on topic  to contribute.
