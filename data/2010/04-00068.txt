Utopia / Dystopia
Dear All
Thank you so much for your thoughts and insights.
I have been thinking about Shambala and Shangri-la (Hilton's Lost  
Horizon) , Kali Yuga and Gore Vidal's novel Kalki. I am trying to find  
possible Indian sources of western literary images... for utopia /  
dystopia.
All Best,
Mary
