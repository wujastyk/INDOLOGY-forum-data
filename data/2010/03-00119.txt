Much simpler than that (Re: expectation (Re: Anyone heard of a              flower called "aniccam?"))
Dear JLC,
Thanks for the bright answers!
My query was much much simpler. I was just wondering why anyone would  
look for answers for some deep-delving academic questions in a non- 
academic naive presentation like that of the young engineer's slide  
presentation of the flowers. That's all.
