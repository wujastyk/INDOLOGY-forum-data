ADMIN: Change in the "reply" function of INDOLOGY
Dear Colleagues,
I understand that in our busy times one may read an email too quickly but nobody so far remarked that the emails sent to Indology are clearly marked TO: INDOLOGY and not TO: Anna Slaczka, for example.
[reading emails too quickly is a mistake I commited right now sending my (first) reply to Steve instead of Indology List :-)]
Cheers,
Anna Slaczka,
Curator South Asian Art
Rijksmuseum
Amsterdam.
