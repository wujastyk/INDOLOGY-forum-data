a question on manuscript traditions
Thanks for the detailed information! It is very helpful So, it does  
look like there was a practice to write a sacred term in manuscripts,  
and it existed prior to the 16-th century when Fr. Henriques prepared  
his grammar of Tamil in Portuguese. Apparently, young men were  
trained in Goa to write in local scripts. The manuscript I'm studying  
seems to contain at least two different handwritings (although one  
dominates).
Interestingly, in some families in the South, "hari.h om" is the very  
first set of words a child is guided to write on rice grains at the  
time of starting formal education. But then this practice is not  
universal and is followed at home at a private religious ceremony.
Regards,
Rajam
