[INDOLOGY] Date of usage of the word Bhaarata to denote India
Dear esteemed colleagues,
Happy holidays.? I am reading and translating a very late ha.tha-yoga text
called the Yoga-Kar.nikaa, the date of which can possibly be determined by
its use of the phrase* sarvatiirthe.su bhaarate*.? Does anyone know the
earliest usage of Bhaarata in the meaning "India"?? I am guessing 19th
century, but I really don't know.
thank you,
