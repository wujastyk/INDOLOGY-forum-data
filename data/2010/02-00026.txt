Abhidharmakoshabhashya in e-format
Thanks to all of you who replied to my reguest. Now I have a reach choise of formats. Unfortunately, I did not find a famous utf-8 to download. And the last remark - it is a pity that there is no full English translation of AKB (we have it in Russian, just not fully published by Rudoi and Ostrovskaya).
Yours Victoria
