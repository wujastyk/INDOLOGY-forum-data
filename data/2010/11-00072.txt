the koti
Western sources were clearly aware of the treatment
of higher numbers in Indian sources in the
early 19th c. 
John Taylor, in his _Lilawati_ (Bombay 1816) already 
gives them up to 17 places (giving ko.ti in the form kotya)
and mentions that Wilkins had earlier presented the
decimal numbers up to 22 places.
I mentioned Ifrah just as a handy compilation -- it is not
an Indological work, nor a work that treats the history
of the many disciplines from which Ifrah compiled his
material.
