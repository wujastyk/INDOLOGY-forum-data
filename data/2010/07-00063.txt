Thanks, Maitreya,  I found this too.
But who's the boss?  Perhaps the post of "Director" doesn't exist any more?
In the old days, Kapila Vatsyayan was the Member Secretary, and was very
definitely the boss.  By that token, Jain would be the boss today.  But
Gharekhan is President of the Trustees and also Chairman of the Executive
Committee, so he's obviously at or near the top.
Thinking more sociologically, who sits in Kapila's old office today?<1>
