Sanskrit e-text of Abhidharmakosa-bhasya
Greetings,
Following the discussion on this list about the Abhidharmakosa-bhasya 
(AKB) Sanskrit e-text available from Peking University, I have 
downloaded and extract the Sanskrit portion and made the resulting 
files available for download:
http://www.columbia.edu/~ph2046/docs/AKB/
In the course of processing this data a number of observations were 
made, so be sure to read the "READ ME.txt" file included for a detail 
list of these issues.
For those of you planning to work extensively with the Sanskrit of 
the AKB, be aware that as a result of the discussion on this list, 
another version of the Sanskrit AKB in e-text has come to light that 
may prove to be "cleaner" data.  It is hoped that this data can be 
made publicly available as well; I or someone else will post 
something to this list as soon as it becomes available.
Regards,
Paul Hackett
