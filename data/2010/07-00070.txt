Text as Saraswati
The pot is a god.  The winnowing
fan is a god.  The stone in the
street is a god.  The comb is a
god.  The bowstring is also a
god.  The bushel is a god and the
spouted cup is a god.
Gods, gods, there are so many
there's no place left
for a foot.
        There is only
one god.  He is our Lord
of the Meeting Rivers.
