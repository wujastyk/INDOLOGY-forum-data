At the link above, I've knocked up a
XeLaTeX<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XeTeX>input file that exemplifies
a few features that Sanskritists like.  This is
all based on the work of others, esp. Somdev Vasudev, Zdenek Wagner, Daniel
Stender, and of course Jonathan Kew (who wrote XeTeX).

The main points are:

   1. Live in the Unicode world.  Then, very good things become possible ...
   2. You can type your files in romanisation and get either Romanisation or
   Devanag?r? output, as you wish, without retyping the text.
   3. You can type Devan?gar? input and get Devan?gar? output.
   4. Devan?gar? hyphenates automatically, and reasonably well.
   5. You can use any Roman or Devan?gar? fonts that are available to you,
   and switch between them easily. (As long as they are Unicode.)

 I am still in the process (!) of trying to set a short Sanskrit critical
edition using plain TeX with Edmac and the Velthuis font package.  It is the
publisher's desire to stick with Velthuis, which (last time I checked) works
only with plain TeX.  But everywhere I look, when I run into a difficulty,
TeX-savvy people are scoffing at the very notion of using plain TeX, yet
also still saying that various portings of Edmac to LaTeX are iffy and
imperfect (though I myself succeeded in using Ledmac for an edition set in
transliteration).
