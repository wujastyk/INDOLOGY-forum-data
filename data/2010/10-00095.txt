Trade in Medieval Sanskrit Literature
Dear Indologists,
My forthcoming book (expected to appear late next month - with apologies for self-promotion) examines Indian Buddhist literary sources, inscriptions, and archaeological materials which illustrate links between long-distance trade and institutional expansion: 
Early Buddhist Transmission and Trade Networks: Mobility and Exchange within and beyond the Northwestern Borderlands of South Asia. Dynamics in the History of Religions, vol. 2.  Brill, Leiden; Boston.
In addition to narratives referred to by other contributors to the discussion, vinaya literature (particularly the P?cittiyavagga of the P?li vinaya and the M?lasarv?stiv?da-vinaya) is a rich source for references to merchants involved in trading activities. 
Regards,
