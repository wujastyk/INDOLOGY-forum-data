Kumarila
Dear All,
I've got a corrupt (pada b and d) sloka  in the Vajirabuddhitika ,  
the source of which is given as "a sloka by Kumarita or Kumarila". I  
did not succeed in locating the sanskrit version, and would be  
grateful for any hint.
The verse is given as
vattamaanesu vijjaanam atiitesv assa sarati
anaagatesu dhammesu sarati vijjaanapa.nidhiiti
For pada b Lance Cousins suggested the emendation: atiitesu anussati,  
pada d remains unclear.
The verse is quoted in the context of the discussion how one can  
speak of recollection in a section dealing with vidyaa.
Best,
Petra Kieffer-P?lz
