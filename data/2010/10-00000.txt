New volume of the Corpus of Indus Seals and Inscriptions
The Corpus of Indus Seals and Inscriptions (CISI) has as its purpose  
to make available for research, in as good photographs as possible,  
all available seals and inscriptions relating to the Indus  
Civilization, including its Early Harappan and Late Harappan phases of  
development. This material is fundamental for the research of the  
poorly understood script, language, and religion of the Indus  
Civilization, and  a major outlet for its art. The seals and other  
types of inscribed artefacts are also important for the study of the  
Harappan social, political and economic organization, including  
administrative practices, external cultural contacts, internal trade  
and various techniques, such as seal carving. The Indus Civilization  
flourished in Pakistan and Northwestern India, and its Mature phase is  
date to 2600-1900 BCE.
The CISI is published by the Finnish Academy of Sciences and Letters,  
with the financial assistance of UNESCO on the recommendation of the  
International Council for Philosophy and Humanistic Studies, and in  
collaboration with the Archaeological Survey of India, the Department  
of Archaeology and Museums, Government of Pakistan, as well as  
numerous excavation projects and museums.
