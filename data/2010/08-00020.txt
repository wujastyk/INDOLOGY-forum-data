Andrew Glass once had macros available from his website to sort Excel tables according to Unicode-transliterated Sanskrit alphabet. On his website, he now has under "projects" only an on-site sorting utility (http://andrewglass.org/sort.php) - this works with simple lists of words. I'm not sure what it does with paragraphs, though.

Dear Philipp,

   If you really need to preserve formatting, rather than writing a
full RTF-compliant application, it might be easier to simply write a
VBA macro with a simple bubble sort to run under Word to perform the
same task.
