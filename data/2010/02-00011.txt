Thanks for reminding people of our own INDOLOGY FAQ.  There's been almost
zero uptake, and I'm curious about why.  Obviously Wikipedia is quite a
magnet, and perhaps the issues of quality control are not quite as dire as
some of us thought.  Certainly the founders of Wikipedia are bullish about
quality control.

As a matter of interest, the Wikipedia pages on the California Hindu
Textbook case were a site of much contention a couple of years ago. If you
made a correction that was even faintly against the Vedic Foundation
position, it got erased or re-written almost immediately.  However, things
have changed.  I made a number of edits last October, and they all still
stand.  In fact nobody has touched the pages after me.

Even more interesting, if you get a history list of people who edited
those pages ranked by number of edits, almost all the top ones are the VF
people, and almost all of them have been banned from using Wikipedia,
mostly for "sockpuppet" violations.

Maybe we should give up the idea of our own FAQ, and just use Wikipedia?

Has anyone else got ideas on why the INDOLOGY FAQ hasn't been used?  Is it
too fussy to get a password, perhaps?

Best,
Dominik
