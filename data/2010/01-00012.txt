Dear colleagues,
Belatedly, a few remarks about Rtu: nobody seems to have mentioned V.  
Raghavan's
Rtu in Sanskrit literature, Delhi : Shri Lal Bahadur Shastri Kendriya  
Sanskrit Vidyapeetha, 1972.
xviii, 196 p. --
Language
and for comparison Charlotte Vaudeville's
Barahmasa; les chansons des douze mois dans les litteratures indo- 
aryennes.
Pondich?ry Institut fran?ais d'indologie 1965, 97p.

Also, the RtusaMhAra continues to be attributed to KAlidAsa. I  
believe I have proven that this poem is not by KAlidAsa in my 2002  
article
"The RtusaMhAra. A new approach" published in Rivista degli Studi  
Orientali, No. 75,, fasc.I-IV, pp. 147-156.

Happy New Year to all!
Stella Sandahl
