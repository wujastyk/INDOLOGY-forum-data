>Dear List Members,
>
>Please excuse cross postings. I have been asked by Oxford University Press
>to compile an online bibliography of Indian Philosophy to be part of their
>Oxford Bibliogrpahy Online project.  It is not supposed to be long: max 7500
>words.  It will include entries on:
>
>
>. Classical darsanas (including selected tranlsations),
>. Textbooks,
>. Anthologies,
>. Secondary works that focus on specific darsanas (Nyaya, Vaisesika,
>Jainism, Vedanta etc.,).
>
>
>If any one would like to make literature suggestions to me for any of these
>sections, please do so off list. I am very happy to hear from authors who
>would like me to include their work. If you are a self promoter, please do
>not feel shy. I cannot guarantee that I can include every suggestion sent to
>me, but I would be greatful for any and all suggestions. Also if you have
>any strong opinions about how such a bibliography should be organized, I
>would love to hear from you.
>
>I am particularly interested in finding out about new secondary material and
>anthologies.
