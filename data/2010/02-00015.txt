D=?iso-8859-15?Q?=E9c=E8s?= de Madeleine Biardeau
I note with sadness the decease of Madeleine Biardeau. I met her only once, in 1978 in Pune. She generously lent me the typescript of her French translation of vidhiviveka? and ny?yaka?ika, which she had prepared while reading those texts with V.A. Ramaswami Sastri. This translation informed my understanding of interpretation of the edition published in the Pandit (supplemented by readings from the ms. of ny?yaka?ik? currently available at Sarasvati Bhavan, Varanasi), and both directly and indirectly influenced the draft edition of these texts that I completed in 1984. I returned the French translation to Mme. Biardeau by post around 1984 or 1985 (I do not have a copy).
