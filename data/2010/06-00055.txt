old Swedish article + Danish paper
Dear Rosane,
Rasmus Nyerup?s 1821 catalog of the Sanskrit books in the library of
the University of Copenhagen has a preface in which he discusses the
state of Sanskrit studies. The book is available for download and
browsing from Google:

Maybe this builds on an earlier lecture or publication, but it does
seem to contain at least some of the material that you are looking
for.
All best,
