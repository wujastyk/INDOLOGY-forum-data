a question on manuscript traditions
I think there is some mention of a Jesuit tradition of writing some sort of invocation on each page in Jonathan Spence's Memory Palace of Matteo Ricci.  I will see if I can find the place.
You might also contact Prof. Noel Sheth, S.J., the latest email I have for whom is 
nsheth43 at gmail.com, or Prof. Frank Clooney, S.J., 
fclooney at hds.harvard.edu, who could refer you to confreres working on Indo-Jesuit writings of the period.
