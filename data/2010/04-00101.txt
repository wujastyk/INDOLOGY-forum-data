Subject: a question on manuscript traditions
Message-ID: <161227089314.23782.11372589224684898196.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I think there is some mention of a Jesuit tradition of writing some sort of invocation on each page in Jonathan Spence's Memory Palace of Matteo Ricci.  I will see if I can find the place.

You might also contact Prof. Noel Sheth, S.J., the latest email I have for whom is 
nsheth43 at gmail.com, or Prof. Frank Clooney, S.J., 
fclooney at hds.harvard.edu, who could refer you to confreres working on Indo-Jesuit writings of the period.
