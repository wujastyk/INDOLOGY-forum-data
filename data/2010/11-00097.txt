prayojanaabhidheya
As for Buddhist:
@article{funayama:prayojana,
  author =	 {Toru Funayama},
  title =	 {{A}rca\d{t}a, \'{S}\=antarak\d{s}ita,
                  {J}inendrabuddhi, and {K}amala\'s\={\i}la on the Aim
                  of a Treatise (\emph{prayojana})},
  journal =	 wzks,
  volume =	 "39",
  pages =	 "181--201",
  year =	 1995,
}
I am not aware of studies on the Brahmanical side, but I find Kum?rila's ?lokav?rttika, Pratij??s?tra 11?25, the beginnings of Ny?yabh??ya/Ny?yav?rttika, to be relatively early treatment of the issue.
Interesting is the beginning of the Vaiy?kara?amah?bh??ya where those terms, though pad?rtha instead of abhidheya, are used but in a different context.
