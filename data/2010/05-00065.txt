Help with keyboard
dear kenneth and others,
i recently tried to install anything i know regarding diacritics, from
gandhari-unicode to baraha, on the windows 7 computer of one of my
students. I learned, to my surprise, that nothing worked at all with w7,
even though different programs use different approaches to override the
standard windows keyboard layout. i could neither find a solution nor the
reason for this, nor any kind of workaround. i simply failed. i decided to
avoid w7 for myaself, [as long as possible] and told my student to do the
same. she now uses xp again - and no problem at all with either of the
approaches tried in vain on w7.
so i can only recommend to downgrade to xp, as long as one cannot use
another os with suitable software available.
if anyone has a solution for the w7 problem, i also would be grateful for
detailed information.
sorry, if some of you find this response lengthy and useless, what it in
fact is.
cheers
