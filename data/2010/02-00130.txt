But, are these labiodental fricatives, like the English f, or bilabial  
(as, for instance, in Japanese)? I would suspect the bilabial version  
(which is what I have heard, I believe, in Northern India and Nepal),  
which is similar in articulation to a voiceless aspirated labial. In  
that case, rather than "hypercorrection," might this perhaps be due to  
a more general, systemic phonetic change (possibly stimulated by  
contact with Perso-Arabic speakers)? Or is this not a useful  
distinction?
