according to productive rules in the late Vedic Suutra / Early Buddhist
period, as a look into Vishva Bandhu's Vaidikapadaanukramako;sa and the
Critical Pali Dictionary will make clear to everybody.

Betreff: Re: [INDOLOGY] Nirukta of anugraha?
The sense of ?favour? in anugraha ? anu-g?h originally ??to accept
subsequently?, cf., Kausika S.56.14 --does not appear to be old, at least
not Vedic. The sense of favour could have grown by way of its employment as
an antonym of nigraha ?obstruction? Yaska, N.1.3, ?rebuke?, ?tormenting?,
Nyaya-S. 1.2.20. The pair of antonyms may be found the Bhakti and
Pratyabhij?a literature.

[INDOLOGY] Nirukta of anugraha?
Dear esteemed colleagues,
In an inquiry apropos to the holiday season, I wonder if any of you have
ever seen a nirukta or nirvacana of anugraha, explaining its derivation,
since there is no obvious connection (that I can see) between anu + grah and
the meanings of anugraha.
thank you,
Chris
