1.The?VVRI index attests use from the late Srautasuutras and Upanishads. The Rgvedic evidence may kindly be furnished. I missed that somehow. I could not procure a copy of the Verba IndoArica even after many efforts.
2. What about Kausika S.56.14 iti brahmacaari.nam anugrhniiyaat?

Dear All,
The semantics of 'favour, promote, take care' is the one and only for the
composite verb ?nu+gra(b)hi, attested since the RV; please refer to my Verba
IndoArica (Vienna: Austrian Academy of Sciences, 1997) I/403 (no. 506S).
