Buddhism and Advaita
I can mention only one specific point from the debate due to the famous
Sankara. It has nothing (or very little and very indirectly) to do with
the reasons for Buddhists to leave India. (And incidentally: I am not a
follower of S. nor am I a Buddhist).
You have to find someone who knows the texts and ask him about Sankara's
commentary on the Brahmasutra's words: anusmRteSca "and on account of
remembrance".
In the commentary S. says: I can remember what I saw yesterday, but I
cannot remember what you saw yesterday.
The implication is: Buddhists cannot explain remembrance or memory. (I am
familiar with some Buddhist counterarguments and do not think they have
refuted S's point.)
The passage is quoted in my book "Discovering the Vedas" which has a
chapter on "The Vedas and Buddhism".
