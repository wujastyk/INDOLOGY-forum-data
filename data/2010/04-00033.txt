Dharmamangal
Dear List,
Not being near a major university library, I write to ask if
anyone knows of an English translation of an edition of the
entire Bengali _Dharmamangal_? I can't get anywhere with google
or the LC. There seem to be a few articles based on it,
but I'm after a certain story in it that has to do with the
goddess Candi. 
Hoping,
Best wishes,
Joanna Kirkpatrick
