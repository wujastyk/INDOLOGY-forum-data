critiques of sacrifice
Dear Benjamin,
Of course, the question of the ethical, social and political consequences,
for a king, of being a Buddhist, is a very interesting one (and it is more
than certain that many among the monastic intellectual elite had very
definite views on the topic). But in my opinion, one is a king before
being a Buddhist. I mean: there are normative, almost sacred, even
formulaic prerogatives and duties for a king in the ancient Indian
context. Look, for instance, at those kings who, in the very same
inscription, present themselves as paramasaugata, i.e., as supreme
(devout) Buddhists, AND praise themselves for preserving the
var.naa'sramadharma. Here too, the contradiction between core Buddhist
values (or: what we take them to be) and the king's self-assertion seems
to be total. What we also ought to consider is: has there been anything
like a Buddhist society, or a properly Buddhist kingdom, in ancient India?
Look, for instance, at Naalandaa and its surrounding: Naalandaa was the
flagship of Indian Buddhism, a place where people converged from all parts
of Asia and which was richly endowed by successive generations of kings of
different dynasties (local Guptas, Vardhana, Paala). Now, the seals that
have been excavated in Naalandaa seem to demonstrate that the whole
administrative, political, juridical and social environment of the
monastic complex wasn't Buddhist at all.
Well, instead of writing too much on this complex and fascinating issue, I
would recommend you to read at least the beginning and the end of Alexis
Sanderson's recently published "The 'Saiva Age" (pp. 41-349 [sic] in
Shingo Einoo, ed.: Genesis and Development of Tantrism, Tokyo, University
of Tokyo, Institute of Oriental Culture, 2009). Here you will find some
answers and at least many insights.
