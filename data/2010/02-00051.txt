Digital Sanskrit corpus and dictionary
Dear Oliver,
Wonderful work indeed...
I just sent your link to a specialist of ancient Greek who is currently writing a paper on digital humanities and especially on the?Thesaurus Linguae Graecae?(TLG,?www.tlg.uci.edu). I copy his answer here, just for fun:"C'est extr?mement impressionnant... Une bonne g?n?ration plus avanc? que le TLG !"?
Many thanks for sharing this !

?: INDOLOGY at liverpool.ac.uk
Dear Oliver,
It is simple awful. I am sure the indologists will benefit from this, and
this tool will provide a new dimension to the indology research.
It will be great if we can make all the electronically available Sanskrit
texts indexed this way!
with warm regards,
