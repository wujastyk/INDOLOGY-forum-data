"African Elites in India"
"India is the only place in the
world where black African ruled
over non-Africans."
A new scholarly book African Elites in India edited by Kenneth X. Robbins and John McLeod tells the story of powerful Indo-Africans who were rulers, statesmen, soldiers, and builders of beautiful mosques. Dr. Robbins identified many Africans in the Deccani, Mughal, and Rajput paintings which are reproduced among the almost 350 high quality images in the book.
