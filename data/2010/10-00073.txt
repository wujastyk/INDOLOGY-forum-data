What about thirty-seven?
The late Alex Wayman once wrote a piece in 
which he sought to explain the 37 Buddhas of
the Mahaayaana rite of contrition as an originally 
astral grouping. I am sorry that I do not have the
precise reference at hand just now, but it's in one 
of his volumes on the tantras.
