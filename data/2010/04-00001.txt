"halanta" is a compound word of "hal"+"anta", meaning "ending in hal".  And
"hal" is a technical term from Paninian grammar that is a special shorthand
code meaning "the consonants".  So "hal-anta" means "ending in a
consonant".  The term originally applied to speech, but has been transferred
to apply to writing, meaning the little subscript stroke or dash that
removes the vowel from a syllable sign.
"Da??a" just means "stick" and refers to the vertical bar or stick-like
stroke that markes the end of a piece of text.  Rather like a semicolon.
Two da??as mark a more definite ending, more like a full stop.  But their
usage is not set in stone.  Some manuscript scribes don't use them at all,
others use them in haphazard ways.  Etymologically, "da??a" may be cognate
with the Greek word "???????, dendron" meaning a tree (and Skt. d?ru, etc.
etc.).
