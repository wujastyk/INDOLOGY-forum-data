Enquiry with regard to colour symbolism in Hindu Traditions
There is also something on the subject as applied to things such as what clothes are appropriate for rites for different purposes in Teun Goudriaan's Maya Divine and Human (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1978), which in turn is largely concerned with the texts assembled in Indrajalavidyasangraha < http://lccn.loc.gov/97903901 > (I think there are later printings of this collection than the 1915 LOC has microfiched.)
