AW: help obtaining a ZDMG article
Oh dear! 20 times...
I had some trouble sending it, but I can assure you that I didn't send it 20
times. I gave up after 3-4 attempts and deleted the message. 
Not the first time this happens, and I blame my service provider. It swamped
the mail box of my business contact completely. On the other hand: you have
to read one of them...
Best regards,
LM
