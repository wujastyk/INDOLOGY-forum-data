Southern pronunciations ? (Re: INDOLOGY FAQ
Note the Telugu wikipedia page on ???? (???????).  Although I can't make out
everything it says, there is a discussion about the alternate name ???????
from "????", "?????."   Brown only gives ??????? as ???? ??????? and
the analysis *v?ra?-?si*.  He says nothing of the spelling ??????? which may
have been introduced into Telugu recently and in imitation of the northern
name.  In this case there doesn't seem to be a mispronunciation but the
correct pronunciation of a different name which is perhaps also the case for
the English pronunciation
