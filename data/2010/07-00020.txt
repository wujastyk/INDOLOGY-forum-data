When I looked to replace it from the same site, <http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~witzel/VedicConcordance/ReadmeEng.html>, I found that there was no version for Mac OS X, though the versions for Windows and Mac Classic were still there. Does anyone know a version that would run on my Mac
You may try Masato Fujii's transcript of the Concordance which comes in simple plain text format:
URL: <http://www.zinbun.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~mfujii/shiryo/concordance.txt>

It should run with every operating system.

Hope it helps
