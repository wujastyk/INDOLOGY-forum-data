AW: help obtaining a ZDMG article
Arlo, 
I suppose you tried just clicking on the PDF icon to the right of the article's entry in that volume's TOC at http://menadoc.bibliothek.uni-halle.de/dmg/periodical/structure/37018? This opens the PDF file for me without any problems. This is the PDF link: 
http://menadoc.bibliothek.uni-halle.de/download/pdf/49310?name=Beitr%C3%A4ge%20zur%20indischen%20Rechtsgeschichte
Does that work? 
Best, 
b

Betreff: help obtaining a ZDMG article
Dear colleagues,
I am trying, without success, to download the article Beitr?ge zur indischen Rechtsgeschichte by J. Jolly from
http://menadoc.bibliothek.uni-halle.de/dmg/periodical/titleinfo/49310
The result is consistently a broken and unreadable pdf. I am not sure if this is due to a problem with my internet connection, or due to a problem with the file itself as stored online. MENADOC's own help function does not seem to be working yet. Can any of you help?
Thank you.
