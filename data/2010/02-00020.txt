Abhidharmakosha in e-format
That's true Dan, if you want to cut-and-paste from the webpage, but if  
you simply download the html "source" files for each chapter from the  
index page, you can get the data with having to modify your browser  
settings.
If you open the resulting file(s) in a plain text editor (one that can  
read UTF-8, of course), you can see that the individual lines are  
consistently tagged.  It should be a simple matter to write a short  
macro or Perl program to extract just the Sanskrit, if desired.
Best,
Paul
