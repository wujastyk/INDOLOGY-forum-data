Halasya Mahatmya Query
In his article, "The "Periya Puran?am" Frieze at Ta?ra?curam: Episodes in the Lives of the Tamil S?aiva Saints",  Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, Vol. 42, No. 2, In Honour of Thomas Burrow (1979), pp. 268-289, J. R. Marr says on p.281, "He made a number of royal journeys on pilgrimage, and in Maturai met the musician Pattira??r, referredto both in P[eriyapur??am] and Tiruvilai[y??al Pur??am] as P??an?r Pattira??r. This does not stop ??umuka n?valar, C. K. Cuppirama?iya Mutaliy?r and Ve?ka?ac?mi N????r referring to this devotee as P??apattirar, perhaps based on Skt. B??abhadra.
I would appreciate if anybody with access to Sanskrit H?l?sya M?h?tmya could check if the name B??abhadra occurs in the episode dealing with ?iva selling firewood in Madurai and give the reference.
Thanks in advance
