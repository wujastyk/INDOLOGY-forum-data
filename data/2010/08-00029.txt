[INDOLOGY] Looking for Hemaprabha S?ri's Trailokyaprak?? a (etc.)
I have been trying for some time, so far unsuccessfully, to procure a copy (printed, photocopied or scanned) of the Trailokyaprak??a by Hemaprabha S?ri. Apart from the edition mentioned by Pingree (New Delhi 1967), I am aware only of a 1980 edition (with Hindi translation) published by the Jamnagar Jain Sangh.
Even more elusive is the T?jikatantras?ra (aka Ga?akabh??a?a, aka Karmaprak??ik?, aka M?nu?yaj?taka) by Samarasi?ha. Here I know of only one edition (with N?laka??ha's T?jikan?laka??h?, Mera?ha 1866).
Any help with locating either of these texts would be greatly appreciated.
