Lost manuscript of Hanxleden's Sanskrit grammar rediscovered
Thanks for posting this on the web.  Again, we were very sorry not to be 
able to make it back to Belgium for the workshop.  We look forward to 
the publication of this exciting find.
Renewed congratulations and best wishes,
Ludo and Rosane Rocher
