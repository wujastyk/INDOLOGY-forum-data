Are you referring to the MSS that are today in the DAV College, Chandigarh?
I am not aware of any VVRI MSS having gone back to Lahore after partition.

An important collection of Sarada MSS was given (sold?) to the VVRI in the
1930s by Dr Paira Mall, who lived in Amritsar, and also bought MSS from
Bhajan Lal, I believe.
