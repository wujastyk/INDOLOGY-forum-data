A note on Poets in the Akananuru
Dear George,
Checking my earlier post on the web, I see that some lines of the poem have mysteriously disappeared. So I am resending the post with some additional information.
In fact, I think the very presence of Kapilar as a family friend suggests that the attribution could be true indeed. U. V?. C?min?taiyar describes the poetic abilities of his teacher M????cicuntaram Pi??ai (1815-1876) at about the same age. So, if the girls had studied Tamil with Kapilar, the two girls could have been excellent poets in their own right. I do not think it would be anything unusual for them to compose such a poem. Moreover, the very structure of the poem suggests that authorship by two persons is very possible as seen below
a??ait ti?ka? avve? nilavi?
entaiyum u?aiy?m em ku??um pi?ar ko??r 
i??ait ti?ka? ivve? nilavi?
ve??e?i muraci? v?ntar em
ku??um ko?t?r y?m entaiyum ilam?
The first two lines could have been uttered by one daughter and the other three lines by another daughter. This pattern of two-person song-making/word play is common in folk songs and this has been depicted in the Tamil epic poetry of the Cilappatik?ram (Ku??akkuravai 12-14), in Bhakti poetry like the Tiruv?cakam (Tirucc??al), and in modern film songs. Although Ku??akkuravai and Tirucc??al are considered to be imitative of originals prevalent in the folk culture, the poem by P?ri's daughters could be an original. The only difference between Pu?am 112 and the later examples in the Cilappatik?ram and the Tiruv?cakam seems to be that the lines in the poem by Pari's daughters do not seem to be addressed to each other but to a third person (Kapilar?).
So, I do not think there is any reason to doubt the traditional attribution of the poem to P?ri Maka?ir.
Talking of Ku??akkuravai 12-14, they also indicate that the source of the genre of ant?di could be in the folk culture and be very old.

Palaniappan
