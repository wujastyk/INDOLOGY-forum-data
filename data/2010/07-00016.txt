Colleagues working on manuscript collation might like to look at Juxta.

   - http://www.juxtasoftware.org/

The blurb says:

Juxta is an open-source cross-platform tool for comparing and collating
multiple witnesses to a single textual work. The software allows users to
set any of the witnesses as the base text, to add or remove witness texts,
to switch the base text at will, and to annotate Juxta-revealed comparisons
and save the results.

Juxta comes with several kinds of analytic visualizations. The primary
collation gives a split frame comparison of a base text with a witness text,
along with a display of the digital images from which the base text is
derived. Juxta displays a heat map of all textual variants and allows the
user to locate ? at the level of any textual unit ? all witness variations
from the base text. A histogram of Juxta collations is particularly useful
for long documents. This visualization displays the density of all variation
from the base text and serves as a useful finding aid for specific variants.
Juxta can also output a lemmatized schedule (in HTML format) of the textual
variants in any set of comparisons.

Best,
