new EJVS issue 17-2: Vajracharya on Unicorns
Long ago I read in a book by the paleontologist Bj?rn Kurt?n that there was also one in Europe (in fact two-horned, but the horns were grown together). The Western legend of the unicorn animal (Hans Henrich has right, there are no such animals in Indian traditions) is a confusion of the Ekasrnga legend (in the Physiologus) and the classical accounts (by Ctesias and Megasthenes) of the one-horned Indian ass or horse, probably referring to rhinoceros -- seasoned with the narwhal teeth. There is wide literature on the subject, apparently unknown to the author of the article.
Best,
Klaus
