Literally 
?Name, occasion, author, extent, application ? should be told at the outset for every ?gama by one desirous of stating.?
It seems to be a general statement on oral the recounting (composition?) of a scripture that was common. More details of the context are necessary for a definite idea.

Dear All,

first thanks to all who helped me with the upodgh?ta? verse.

I am now in search of a Sanskrit parallel for the verse? from the Vajirabuddhi??k? cited below, or for a list of the five terms sa??? nimitta? katt? parim??a? payojana?. The only source for these five terms up to now is Candrak?rti (see Steinkellner, "Remarks on Tantristic Hermeneutics", Csoma de K?r?s Memorial Symposium, 1978), where they come under the first of the seven ala?k?ras, i.e. upodghata?, which form a group of exegetical tools used in interpreting Tantras.

verse from Vjb 1,17-18

sa??? nimitta? katt? ca parim??a? payojana?
sabb?gamassa pubbeva vattabba? vattu? icchat? ti

the meaning of the terms in Vjb is as follows:

sa??? = name of the text
nimitta? = motive for writing the text
katt? = author
parim??a? = extent, length of the text
payojana? =? purpose of the text


According to a v.l. in Vjb this verse is said for every Tantra (pavutt? sabbatant?na?)

Every hint is welcome,
Petra
