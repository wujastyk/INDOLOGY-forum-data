Dear Dr. Pant,

After all this discussion, I am quite curious to see a little bit of  
the inscriptions, partly just to exclude the possibility that the  
expression which explains where these Vasi.s.thagotrin Bha.t.tas hail  
from might be analysed differently.  Could they have come, for  
instance, from the deltaic region between branches of the Kaaverii:  
[kaaveriinadyanta]-raalade"sa ? Are the inscriptions in Sanskrit ?
