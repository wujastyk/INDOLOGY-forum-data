Why not C-like syntax:
for ((i = 1; i <= 397; i++)) do
? bash 3 (default on OS X) accepts this syntax. It works even when bash called as sh. The ksh, too, has that syntax; I wouldn't be surprised if the original bourne shell had it.
I personally use a perl script calling several instances of curl at the same time.
All the best,
