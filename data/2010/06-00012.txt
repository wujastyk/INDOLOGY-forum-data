Subject: Query about HOS vols 42 & 44 closed

Dear List,
I wish to express my deep appreciation for the kindness of folks
on this list for helping me to sort out my little problem about
the HOS vols. 42 & 44, and who did which. 
Apparently both vols 42 and 44 are still available from
Harvard....good news. 
 
Best wishes,
Joanna K.
