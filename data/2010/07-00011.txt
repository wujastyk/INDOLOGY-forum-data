(Xe)(La)TeX, (L)Edmac, and Velthuis query
Dear colleagues,
A number of you have been kind in your responses to my blog post about using
XeLaTeX to do Devanagari, so I've gone further and posted a mini-edition
that exemplifies the use of the previous stuff (Unicode romanisation input,
with Nagari output), as well as the Ledmac system for formatting a critical
edition.  The materials are here:
