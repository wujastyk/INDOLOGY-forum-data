BitComet as (simpler?) alternative to wget
One can use a free batch downloader called BitComet to download DLI books in one go -- no bash scripts necessary.  
Once the program is installed, open it, press Ctrl+B for the batch download dialogue box, and paste the entire URL of the first page in the upper field.  One way to get this URL is to open the book in the DLI website's reader interface, which will produce a URL like this:
http://www.new.dli.ernet.in/scripts/FullindexDefault.htm?path1=/rawdataupload1/upload/0132/045&first=1&last=268&barcode=99999990133383
\
Then remove "FullindexDefault.htm?path1=/" and the whole string beginning with the first &, and append: PTIFF/00000001.tif
to produce:
http://www.new.dli.ernet.in/rawdataupload1/upload/0132/045/PTIFF/00000001.tif
Then in the second field of the batch download dialogue box, insert this same URL, but replace the 00000001 with the number of the last page preceded by enough 0's to make eight digits.  The last page number can be found in the original URL after the string "&last=".  In the example above, this will produce:
http://www.new.dli.ernet.in/rawdataupload1/upload/0132/045/PTIFF/00000268.tif
Then click ADD and DOWNLOAD NOW.
The tifs can then be combined in Acrobat into a single PDF.

wget (was: Re: Abhandlungen der K?nigliche n Akademie der  Wissensch aften zu Berli)
Birgit is quite right about the value of wget.  It's an amazing little
tool.  I use it routinely to get books from the Digital Library of India,
where texts are presented only as individual pages.
Until about a year ago, one could use the "-r" recursion setting of wget
to fetch a whole directory-full of files in one go.  Then the DLI disabled
that feature.  So now one has to issue a wget command for each page.
But it's easy to do with a small bash script like this:
#!/bin/sh
# fetch Kapadia_Desc.Cat.Govt.Colls.MSS.BORI-Jaina
# Literature and Philosophy XIX.1 Svetambara Works_1957
for i in {00000001..397..1}
        do
                wget http://www.new.dli.ernet.in/data/upload/0048/903/PTIFF/$i.tif
        done
The magic number "371" is the number of pages in the book, which DLI tells
you.  In Firefox, you can find out the directory in which a book's TIFF
files live by loading a page of the book and then hitting Tools/Page Info
and selecting "media".
Bash is the default shell in Linux; it's also available to Windows users
by installing the excellent Cygwin.
Best,
Dominik
