Here are two theses:

Jain, Narendra Kumar: Indian Colour Symbolism. Berlin, 1978
Berlin, Techn. Univ., Diss., 1977

Slavik, Jan: Dance of Colours: Basic Patterns of Colour Symbolism in Mah?y?na Buddhism. G?teborg: G?teborgs Etnografiska Museum, 1994. (Etnologiska studier, v. 41). ISBN 9187484080
University of G?teborg, Ph. D. Thesis, 1994

Besides these, many publications on iconography deal also with religious symbolism and will give lots of references in this respect. 

Hope it helps
