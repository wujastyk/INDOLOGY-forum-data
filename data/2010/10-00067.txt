eighteen
Dear Professor Bussanich,
So far as I remember, only tangentially.  Here is all that I wrote in  
my articles:
Instances of nine squared, eighty-one, are not particularly frequent  
and I have already given those that I have noticed.  However,  
eighty-four seems to have been favoured in the heterodox movements.   
According to Maskarin Gos?la, each individual transmigrates for  
84,00,000 mah?kalpas.  In Jainism, the lifespan of the first and  
eleventh t?rtha?karas was eighty-four lakhs and that of the eighteenth  
Jina Aran?tha was 8400 years, while the interval between Nemin?tha and  
P?r?van?tha is said to have been 84,000 years.  For Buddhism, there is  
the fact that in the Mah?sudarsana Sutta the palace of king Sudarsana  
had 84,000 pillars and chambers, his territory had 84,000 cities and  
palaces, and he had 84,000 wives, chariots and so on; also,  
traditionally A?oka erected 84,000 st?pas.[63]

(Pr?taranuv?ka), p. 117 n. 4.
