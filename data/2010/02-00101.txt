I agree about publishers, George.  Like many on this list, I'm sure, I've
had my share of arguments with publishers about accents.  I've found it
helpful to draw an analogy with French or German.  It wouldn't be acceptable
to print those languages without their accents, and nor is it acceptable for
Sanskrit.
You said,
There's lots to discuss about the various Clay decisions, but one thing I
quite like is the use of the acute accent to mark stress or ictus.  While
ictus isn't the same as vowel length, it's pretty close to gauravam, and
people who know nothing of Sanskrit and don't have access to a teacher do
rather well reading such accented words out loud.
Best,
