Dear colleagues,

My email address is
   wujastyk at gmail.com

Please be sure to use that address if you write to me, and weed out any
references to
d.wujastyk @ ucl.ac.uk
wujastyk @ ucl.ac.uk
ucgadkw @ ucl.ac.uk.
In fact, <anything> @  ucl.ac.uk

I switched address a couple of years ago, and I've been rather pro-active in
spreading the new address.  There's also an auto-response from the old
address that informs about the change.

But today I logged in to my old UCL account after a longish gap, and was
horrified to discover amongst hundreds and hundreds of spams a few important
messages from colleagues that had never reached me.

I'm hoping that the gmail address above will be good for life.

Thank you!
