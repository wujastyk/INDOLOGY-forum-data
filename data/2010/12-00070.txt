my new email address
Dear colleagues,
My email address is
   wujastyk at gmail.com
Please be sure to use that address if you write to me, and weed out any
references to
d.wujastyk @ ucl.ac.uk
wujastyk @ ucl.ac.uk
ucgadkw @ ucl.ac.uk.
In fact, <anything> @  ucl.ac.uk
I switched address a couple of years ago, and I've been rather pro-active in
spreading the new address.  There's also an auto-response from the old
address that informs about the change.
But today I logged in to my old UCL account after a longish gap, and was
horrified to discover amongst hundreds and hundreds of spams a few important
messages from colleagues that had never reached me.
I'm hoping that the gmail address above will be good for life.
Thank you!
