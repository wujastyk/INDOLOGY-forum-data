K.R. Norman has a very interesting and relevant study of the translation 
process underlying the Greek versions of Asokan inscriptions: JRAS 1972: 
111-118.

Dear Colleagues,

I am working on a piece about translation in India pre-1800 and wonder if 
anybody has written on inscriptions which appear in more than one language. 
I am thinking of things like the way that Ashokan inscriptions have the same 
messages localised to the speech of different locations. Are there any 
examples from more recently of rulers issuing edicts in several scripts and 
languages?

thanks

Peter
