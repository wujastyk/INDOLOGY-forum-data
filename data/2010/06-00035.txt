Gandhari Prajnaparamita ?
Dear Colleagues,
In the appendix to his new index of Lokak?ema's A??as?hasrik? PP, Dr 
Karashima mentions the recent discovery of a G?ndh?r? text of (presumably) a 
proto-A??asahasrika PP. He is a bit vague about this and does not give any 
details. Can anybody clarify for me what has been found etc.
Many thanks,
Stephen Hodge
