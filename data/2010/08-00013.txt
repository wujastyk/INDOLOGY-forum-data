Hiragana and Indic Scripts
Dear Colleagues,
any ideas on leads on Indic script connections with Japanese Hiragana/Katakana scripts?
Hiragana/Katakana starts a i u e o ka ki ku ke ko etc.
The organization of the Japanese sound system seems related to Indic systems, but Japanese histories of their scripts that I have seen are quite silent on the relationship between Siddham and Kana script systems that I have observed (my current notes on this at http://bodhgayanews.net/melbournehindi/?p=22).
I am sure that somebody must have written on this, any idea where?
regards
