I would agree with Birgit on this point.  I have had great succes 
with ABBYY working with diacritic characters and, most recently, with 
Devanagari -- see:

Eventually, it is my hope to make both my diacritic & Devanagari 
recognition files for ABBYY freely available for others to use.

Part of the problem with the poor results that you experienced is 
certainly due to the fact that you were working with 300 dpi scans. 
This is too low of a resolution for OCR.  You need a minimum of 400 
dpi for decent OCR accuracy.
