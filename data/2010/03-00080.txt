trivalI in compounds
After Jay?ditya?s explanation of P.2.1.51 taddhit?rthottarapadasam?h?re ca when, of a compound?formed after 2.1.50 the final meaning is that of a taddhita suffix or when a third word (uttarapada) follows the compound or when an ensemble is meant one gets a tatpuru?a compound. This uttarapada compound is different from the uttarapadalopin compound commonly illustrated with si?h?sana ?lion (marked) ?seat ?ie a throne?. Naturally trilokan?tha (Kum?rasambhava 5.77) has been explained by Mallin?tha as an uttarapada compound. This is implied also in the explanation of trilokasaundarya ?(5.41).
trival? ?is neither an uttarapadalopin nor an uttarapada compound. An ensemble is meant. Naturally 2.1.50 and 51 are sufficient for forming the compound without invoking the concept of uttarapadalopin.? The ga?as?tra 50 appended to 4.1.45 takes care of the long ? of words like trival?.

trivalI in compounds
Dear List Members,
Can anyone help finding a reference in Paninian literature for the
lengthening of the final vowel of trivali to trivalI in compounds?
MW says "f. in comp. the 3 folds over a woman's navel (regarded as a beauty)
VarB?S. lxx , 5 ?itus. GarP."
I have looked in P. 6.3.114-139, which appears to be the relevant section,
but may have missed something.
With thanks,
Oliver
