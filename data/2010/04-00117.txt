critiques of sacrifice
Hello,
One of the leaders of Kerala renaissance of the 19th century Sri  
Chattambi Swamikal has vehemently criticised the Vedic sacrifices in  
his book named VedaadhikaaraniruupaNam. I have collected his complete  
works and published. I have also written a book named Marxism and  
Yagasamskaram. All these are in Malayalam.
