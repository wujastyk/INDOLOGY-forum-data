(Xe)(La)TeX, (L)Edmac, and Velthuis query

If what is aimed for is (a) the production of high-quality print

Sanskrit text without annotation (and have it searchable), then I would 
suggest moving up an abstraction layer - start encoding the edition in 
XML. If you know any scripting language that can deal with XML (perl, 
php, python), getting a TEI-compliant XML source text for a critical 
edition to LaTeX source code for printing with ledmac, or to HTML for 
online publication, is quite simple (time-consuming, but simple).
If you work in a (La)TeX environment, you may well be able to convert 
romanized to Devanagari and vice versa - but I don't think you will be 
able to extract searchable text without annotation, at least not without 
a lot of manual intervention and correction.
The problem is that closing braces in (La)TeX source code don't tell you 
what they close (whereas <note> in XML always has a matching </note>, 
for instance). I did encounter cases where it was formally not possible 
anymore to extract the actual text from a jungle of notes just with 
scripting or programming.
In the larger picture, if more editorial projects decided to work with 
XML from the start and were kind enough to share the resultant e-texts 
with repositories like SARIT, this would really help towards building 
larger digital corpora of better philological quality ... producing 
editions with Word or other specialized software that has its own 
proprietary file-format and does not follow any open standards is in my 
opinion a kind of technical imprisonment and rather solipsistic. The 
learning-curve towards XML is a little steep, but I think it really pays 
off.
