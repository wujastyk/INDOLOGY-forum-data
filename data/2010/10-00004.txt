Subject: SARIT service faulty
Message-ID: <161227090349.23782.2141155209689090282.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

There is currently a fault with the SARIT.indology.info search and indexing
service.  We are actively investigating the problem and will announce
resumed service as soon as possible.  In the meantime, my apologies for the
loss of service.
