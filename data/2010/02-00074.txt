Southern pronunciations ? (Re: INDOLOGY FAQ
This is exactly the sort of thing I was wondering about when I brought 
up the matter of the pronunciation of Varanasi.  The data from Kannada 
is very interesting, as is the contrast with Malayalam..
Velcheru Narayana Rao informs me that "in Telugu speech it is 
vaaranaasi.  (The third syllable long, and also the last vowel short.)"
So it does appear that, unlike the words "Mahabharata" and "Ramayana," 
for "Varanasi" there are strong, though regional, traditions supporting 
a second pronunciation.
