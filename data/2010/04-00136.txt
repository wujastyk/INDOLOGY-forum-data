AW: homa and cremation
In Newar funery rituals, three unfired bricks serve as the hearth in which a fire of three small bamboo sticks is lit in order to pacify the deceased. Thhis is called pretaZAntihoma or in Nevari: kulehoma. For details and photos see N. Gutschow and A. Michaels, Handling Death. The Dynamics of Death and Ancestor Rituals among the Newars of Bhaktapur, Nepal. Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 2005, pp. 88-96.

Betreff: homa and cremation
While Brahmanical funerary rituals in some
contexts stipulate the performance of homa
in connection with final rites, does it occur that
the cremation itself comes to be considered as
a homa? This does occur in some Tibetan rituals
that I am working on, and I wish to ascertain whether
or not this was a novel innovation, or if there was
in fact a basis for this development in earlier
Indian tradition.
