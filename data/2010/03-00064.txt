trivalI in compounds
Hello,
Vamana has something to say about the word in his Kavyalamkarasutra with a
Paninian citation, but I'm not sure if its exactly what you are looking
for.   This is the text from GRETIL:
*trival??abda? siddha? sa?j?? cet // VKal_5,2.14 [*VKal_5,2.13] //*
trival??abda? siddho yadi sa?j?? / *diksakhye sa.?j??y?m*(P?_2,1.50) iti
sa?j??y?meva sam?savidh?n?t //14//
All the Best,
