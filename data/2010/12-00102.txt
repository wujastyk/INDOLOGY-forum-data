Date of usage of the word Bhaarata to denote India
Looks are probably deceiving here, Andrea. The Malay word in question is inherited from Proto-Malayo Polynesian *habaRat 'northwest monsoon' according to??the interesting article K. Alexander Adelaar, 1997, "An Exploration of Directional Systems in West Indonesia and?Madagascar", in Gunter Senft (ed.), Referring to Space. Studies in Austronesian and?Papuan Languages, Oxford: Clarendon Press, p. 53-81.?Moreover, early loans of words with aspirated consonants in Indo-Aryan yield insertion of a vowel in Malay, not loss of the aspiration (e.g. bahaya < bhaya, pahala < phala, dirgahayu < d?rgh?yu).
