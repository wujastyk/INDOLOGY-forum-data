Dear Colleagues,
another perspective on this debate relates to Hindi usage.
Nirvana (often in the form nirban) continues to be used in Hindi to the present day in the verses of Nirgun Sant poets such as Kabir, Raidas, and Dharamdas. 
In such verses the term moksa occurs in compounds such as 'liberated while living' (jivanmukta) and attaining liberation is often spoken as reaching the 'the state of nirvana' (pad nirban). I have just been translating verses by Dharmdas, a follower of Kabir, in which Nirvana was envisaged as a perfect land full of pearl palaces and fountains of nectar etc.
regards
Peter
