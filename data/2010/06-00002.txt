F. Staal review by Renou?
Dear Colleagues,
Frits Staal asks help to find a small (about one page) review of his  
book
NAMBUDIRI VEDA RECITATION of 1961.
It was published by Louis Renou in the JOURNAL ASIATIQUE but is not  
on line because there are several gaps.
The review must have been published around 1962 and his name will be  
listed as ?J.F. Staal?.
If you have easy access to it, please send it to
fritsstaal at berkeley.edu.
Many thanks !
Michael
