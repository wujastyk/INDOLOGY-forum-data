wget (was: Re: Abhandlungen der K=?utf-8?Q?=C3=B6nigliche?= n              Akademie der  Wissensch aften zu Berli)
Birgit is quite right about the value of wget.  It's an amazing little
tool.  I use it routinely to get books from the Digital Library of India,
where texts are presented only as individual pages.
Until about a year ago, one could use the "-r" recursion setting of wget
to fetch a whole directory-full of files in one go.  Then the DLI disabled
that feature.  So now one has to issue a wget command for each page.
But it's easy to do with a small bash script like this:
#!/bin/sh
# fetch Kapadia_Desc.Cat.Govt.Colls.MSS.BORI-Jaina
# Literature and Philosophy XIX.1 Svetambara Works_1957
for i in {00000001..397..1}
	do
		wget http://www.new.dli.ernet.in/data/upload/0048/903/PTIFF/$i.tif
	done
The magic number "371" is the number of pages in the book, which DLI tells
you.  In Firefox, you can find out the directory in which a book's TIFF
files live by loading a page of the book and then hitting Tools/Page Info
and selecting "media".
Bash is the default shell in Linux; it's also available to Windows users
by installing the excellent Cygwin.
Best,
Dominik
