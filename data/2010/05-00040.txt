Invitation for Contribution in the Volume on "Persian in              Kashmir"
Dear Mrinal, Sorry to intrude on a person correspondence, but I'm curious about your bad experience at Concordia.  If you feel you can share with me, I'd like to know what makes it so bad, since one of our former students at U of Penn. is on the faculty there.  Incidentally, he was not my proper student, just took a few courses with me.  I hope things get better for you.  With regards, George Cardona
