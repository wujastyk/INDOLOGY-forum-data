ADMIN: Change in the "reply" function of INDOLOGY
I've just switched the list's default behaviour to "Reply to Sender" rather
than "Reply to List".  Let's see how we like it.
In the 20-year history of this INDOLOGY list, this topic has of course come
up before.  In the past, the consensus has been that "reply to list" is a
greater convenience, and "reply to sender" is not what most people want for
most postings.
Anyhow, let's see.  Times change.
Best,
Dominik Wujastyk
INDOLOGY duty committee member
