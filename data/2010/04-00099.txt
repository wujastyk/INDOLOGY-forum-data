A note on Poets in the Akananuru
Dear S. Palaniappan,
once could also see it the other way round
and say that the group of poems under consideration
is what remains of a bigger structure
which may have contained Verse linked by Prose,
like what we have in the ???? ?????? [p?rata ve?p?],
????????, ?????, ????? ????????? [uttiy?ka, v??uma, tur??a paruva?ka?]
as it was printed in 1925,
[patipp?ciriya?: pa??ita a. k?p?laiya?].
Another possibility is to say
that the group of poems alludes, in a learned way, to local popular 
performances.
Think of what Gananath Obeyesekere writes on pp.605-606
in his 1984 book /The Cult of the Goddess Pattini/
(The University of Chicago Press, ISBN 0-226-61602-9)
He writes

It seems apparent to me that most South Indian scholars are wrong when 
they assume that the ritual texts derive from the /Cilappatik?ram/; the 
contrary is truer, that the /Cilappatik?ram/ is a well-crafted work of 
art that uses material from a preexistent and coexistent ritual 
tradition. (p.605)
[...]
I agree with South Indian scholars like Dikshitar who state that C?tta? 
narrated the events he actually saw (Dikshitar 1939, p.71), except that 
I think C?tta? saw not a natural event but a ritual drama.! (p.606)
