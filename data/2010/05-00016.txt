ramanuja gita bhasya
If you go to the "gita supersite" (just do a google search, there is an 
easy-to-use beta: <http://202.3.77.102/acquia/?q=node/69>), you can easily 
generate downloadable pdf files in devanagari of Ramanuja's commentary. 
Just click the necessary boxes.  However, it generates just one chapter per 
file.
