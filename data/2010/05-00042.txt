I started using e-mail so long ago that new users were then given courses by the IT department at my University on how to use this new tchnology.

I strongly second Professor Lindquist's strong urging. Of the many lists I receive, this Indology list results in by far the most red-faced apologies for messages sent here by mistake. (By the way, Steven, are we still on for lunch today?)
