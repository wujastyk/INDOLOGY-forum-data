Subject: Turtles (and elephants) all the way down?

This passage in Mur?ri's Anarghar?ghava may not be evidence of an  
elephant-turtle stack, since we have just a list of things that hold  
up the earth, but here are the elephants and the turtle at least  
brought together.

m?? pras?ya katham astu vig?to h? par?rthavimukho  
raghuva??a? 1.38

In R?ja?ekhara's B?lar?m?ya?a they are exhorted to work together:

p?thvi sthir? bhava bhuja?gama dh?rayain??
tva? k?rmar?ja tad ida? dvitaya? dadh?th??.
dikku?jar?? kuruta tattritaye didh?r???
deva? karoti harak?rmukam ?tatajyam 1.48
