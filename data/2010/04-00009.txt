Turtles (and elephants) all the way down?
This passage in Mur?ri's Anarghar?ghava may not be evidence of an  
elephant-turtle stack, since we have just a list of things that hold  
up the earth, but here are the elephants and the turtle at least  
brought together.

In R?ja?ekhara's B?lar?m?ya?a they are exhorted to work together:
