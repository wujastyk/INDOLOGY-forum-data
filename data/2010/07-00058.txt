Arthasastra Commentary
As my note says, the JayamaNgalaa was first published in vol.26 of the Journal in parts during the years 1956 and 1957. Maybe the book is still available in some shops where antique books are available.

Re: [INDOLOGY] Arthasastra Commentary
Thank you very much for this information. Our library has only volume 27 (1957) and on, but not the earlier ones. Do you know in what volume the earlier sections were published, and  if copies of the edition is available anywhere for sale? Thanks.Patrick Olivelle

The commentary was first published in instalments in the Journal of the Oriental reseach Institute, and later it was issued in the book form. The first part of the commentary was originally punlished likewise in the same volume of the Journal.
