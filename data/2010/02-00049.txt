Digital Sanskrit corpus and dictionary
Dear Oliver,
It is simple awful. I am sure the indologists will benefit from this, and
this tool will provide a new dimension to the indology research.
It will be great if we can make all the electronically available Sanskrit
texts indexed this way!
with warm regards,
