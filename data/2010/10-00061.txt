Dear Colleagues,

There is also some treatment of 18 in several articles on numbers as a  
whole, e.g. Siegfried Lienhard, "Lucky Numbers in Ancient Indian  
Literature", Langue, style et structure dans le monde indien:  
Centenaire de Louis Renou, ed. Nalini Balbir et Georges-Jean Pinault,  
Champion, Paris, 1996, pp. 523-36, and S.S.N. Murthy, "Number  
Symbolism in the Vedas", Electronic Journalof Vedic Studies 12.3,  
2005, pp. 87-99, also my own "Meaningful Numbers?", Research Bulletin,  
Vishveshvaranand Vedic Research Institute 4 & 5, 2006, pp. 21-64.
