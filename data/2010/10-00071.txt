Post-Scriptum [=wishful thinking]  (Re: What about thirty-seven?              [why is it UNEQUAL to 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9] (Re: [INDOLOGY] eighteen
Post-Scriptum:
Of course, since I personally find the idea that anyone might want to 
slaughter "Three thousand seven hundred goats" AND/OR "thirty seven 
buffaloes" UNBEARABLE, I have to make the assumption that MY HIDDEN 
INTENTION in making this post is to prove that the mistake in the 
addition (/id est/ the fact that 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9 and 37 are NOT 
EQUAL) definitely PROVES that such sacrifices never took place 
(otherwise they would have noticed that there was a mistake in the 
addition).
But unfortunately,
I know that this is just wishful thinking :-((
