Well, mzybe not so cool: Sanskrit script?
Allen,
There are plenty of Kashmirian mss of that time, which were copied from 
Nagari mss or demonstrably transcribed from Sharada exemplars, although 
Sharada did not entirely fall into desuetude. Occasionally, Nagari mss were 
even copied from printed books, which strengthens your point. In any case we 
must however assume a general turn in writing towards Nagari irrespective of 
book printing.
The most detailed accounts of Ranjit Singh's (Sikh) rule predating the 
Dogras I am aware of are the voluminous contemporary travel reports by 
William Moorcroft, Johann Martin Honigberger, Baron von Huegel, and Godfrey 
Thomas Vigne. They are likely to provide useful information in this regard.

Ego ex animi mei sententia spondeo ac polliceor
studia humanitatis impigro labore culturum et provecturum
non sordidi lucri causa nec ad vanam captandam gloriam,
sed quo magis veritas propagetur et lux eius, qua salus
humani generis continetur, clarius effulgeat.
