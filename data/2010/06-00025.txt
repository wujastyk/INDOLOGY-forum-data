Raaladesha and more
Dear Ashok,
I am not sure what you mean by "early sources", but I believe there is plenty of unambiguous evidence that Raa.dhaa was primarily the name of a region, or perhaps the conglomerate of two regions often specified at Dak.si.na- and Uttara-Raa.dhaa, and one that is associable with what we now know as Bengal. See the several references under this toponym in Puspa Niyogi, Brahmanic Settlements in Different Subdivisions of Ancient Bengal. Calcutta, Indian Studies: Past & Present, 1967.
