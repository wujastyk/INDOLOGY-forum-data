(Xe)(La)TeX, (L)Edmac, and Velthuis query
Dear Birgit,
I very much agree with you that that marking up primary texts and our
scholarly output in TEI would be worthwhile, for each of us
individually and for the field.
Another route that I have been dabbling with and plan to use more
seriously (for automated edition typesetting from our G?ndh?r?
database) is via TeXML:
   http://getfo.org/texml/
This is a little preprocessor for TeX that allows one to express
(La)TeX files in XML syntax, turning the programming task into a
transformation from one form of XML (TEI) into another (TeXML), which
can be accomplished quite elegantly and efficiently using XSLT.
All best,
Stefan
