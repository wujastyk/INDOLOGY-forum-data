Sorting Paragraphs
Dear Colleagues,
I am currently preparing a glossary of Sanskrit terms in transliteration,
for which I would like to use a software that sorts paragraphs automatically
in a sequence according to the Sanskrit alphabet. I am working with a
Unicode font and a Windows operating system. The software (share- or freeware
preferred) should be RTF compatible in order to preserve the font formats of
the original file.
Any suggestions?
With many thanks in advance and best regards,
Philipp Maas
