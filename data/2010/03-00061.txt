Dear Colleagues,

Does anybody happen to have a copy of this to hand:

Die Sprache der ?ltesten buddhistischen ?berlieferung (The language of the 
earliest Buddhist tradition) Ed. Heinz Bechert.

I do not have immediate access to this at the moment, but I need to see the 
paper included therein by Gustav Roth: "Particular features of the language 
of the ?rya-Mah?s??ghika-Lokottarav?dins and their importance for early 
Buddhist tradition".

If it is not too onerous, would anybody be very kind and scan & send this 
paper to me ~ I do not think it is very long so it shoudl not take up too 
much of your valuable time. I shall, of course, be very grateful and 
indebted etc as always !

Best wishes,

Stephen Hodge
