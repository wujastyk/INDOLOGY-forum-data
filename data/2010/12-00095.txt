AW: [INDOLOGY] Nirukta of anugraha?
To avoid misunderstanding I should add that, as explicitly in the Kau?.S, the sense of anu in the Rgveda too is more of the sequence (colouring the verb) than of favour. The literal sense prevails. The future might have been in shape but was not yet accomplished.

Dear All,
The semantics of 'favour, promote, take care' is the one and only for the
composite verb ?nu+gra(b)hi, attested since the RV; please refer to my Verba
IndoArica (Vienna: Austrian Academy of Sciences, 1997) I/403 (no. 506S).
