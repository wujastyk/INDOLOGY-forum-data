Access to Updated Vedic Concordance
Dear List, 
My latest computer crash has cost me access to a a few valuable resources, which I had thought would be easily available online, so I didn't make backups of them. 
One of these is the updated version of Bloomfield's Vedic Concordance [which I own in its book version].? This updated version was done by Marco Franceschini in 2005.? In my google searches?for this I get only pages that say that this document?is no longer freely accessible. 
Is this correct? 
Thanks for any help.
