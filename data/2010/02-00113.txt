enunciated by P. T. Barnum, but it was popularized by the great New Yorker 
writer, E. B. White in describing his teacher, Willaim Strunk (recounted in 
the preface to their "Elements of Style"):
"He felt it was worse to be irresolute than to be wrong.  I remember a day 
in class when he leaned far forward, in his characteristic pose--the pose of 
a man about to impart a secret--and croaked, "If you don't know how to 
pronounce a word, say it loud!  If you don't know how to pronounce a word, 
say it loud!"  This comical piece of advice struck me as sound at the time, 
and I still respect it.  Why compound ignorance with inaudibility.  Why run 
and hide?"
