new EJVS issue 17-2: Vajracharya on Unicorns
The problem is even deeper: None of the passages that Vajracharya  
cites establish that there was a belief in a one-horned gazelle; the  
only thing that can be established is that the sage ??ya???ga  
had just one horn. In fact, if one wanted to speculate, this could be  
attributed to the fact that only one of his parents was a gazelle, the  
other one was human.
