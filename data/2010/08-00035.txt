Prayers vary from region to region. Still, the setting makes it appear that the first three sentences pertain to the m?tr?k? but after that, from anusv?ra, the prayer pertains to the process ie the significance of anusv?ra etc. If this is correct bindu is the thing and not the written representaion. In ??kt?gama bindu is the neuter unconscious element of the triratna.

Dear Indologists,

? ???I recite the Ga?e?aa Atharva??r?a everyday since my childhood, but I had not previously thought about some of the lines in it:? gak?ra? p?rvar?pam / ak?ro madhyamar?pam / anusv?ra? c?ntyar?pam / bindur uttarar?pam / n?da? sandh?nam / sa?hit? sandhi? /.? While the anusv?ra is considered to be antya, the bindu is considered to be uttara.? Is there any (t?ntric?) explanation to split the anusv?ra and the bindu.? I always thought that bindu is simply a graphic representation for the anusv?ra, as is seen in some grammars of Skt:? upari???d bindur anusv?ra?.? How would one distinguish antya from uttara in these lines?? Any suggestions?
