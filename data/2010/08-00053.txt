Sanskrit texts in TEI/XML format available from SARIT
Richard mentions Christian Wedemeyer's *Cary?mel?pakaprad?pa* e-text.  We've
tried negotiating with Christian's publisher about this, but unfortunately
received no answer.  They gave permission for the file to be in the SARIT
database as a searchable text, but not for the public distribution of HTML,
XML or PDF versions.  I live in hope.
Best,
Dominik
