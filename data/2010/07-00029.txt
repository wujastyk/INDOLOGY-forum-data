Dr. G. Vijayavenugopal provides a complete English translation of the 
inscriptions of the territory of Pondicherry and Karaikkal, edited in 
Part I. The translations represent an attempt to render the nuances of 
the Tamil syntax of this particular sort of document. Such a volume is 
something of a landmark: the last volume of South Indian Inscriptions to 
provide complete translations appeared in 1920?29.
A Preface by Emmanuel Francis and Charlotte Schmid explores the form and 
changing role of the royal eulogy in Tamil that prefaces many Tamil 
inscriptions. A general introduction, a chapter on language and 
linguistics and one about the inscriptions as historical source material 
by Dr. Vijayavenugopal follow this. A glossary, a list of formulaic 
phrases and several appendices open the corpus up to various potential 
users.
Keywords: epigraphy, royal eulogy, Cola, Tamil
