What about thirty-seven? [why is it UNEQUAL to              1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9] (Re: [INDOLOGY] eighteen
Dear Professor Dipak Bhattacharya,
It is true that 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8 = 36
and that 36+1 = 37.
A historical shift (from 8 to 9) might indeed be an explanation.
Of course it is explaining obscure things by making use of obscure 
things, but such is life for indologists ;-)
There are domains in which pretty much everything is obscure.
Just in case a few of the members on this list are not terrified by 
arithmetics (I am not! :-)) and since this list now allows 
attachments, please find attached to this message an image which is 
scanned from a page inside /The Book of Numbers/ [1996](by Conway and 
Guy) which I mentioned earlier).
Best wishes to all
