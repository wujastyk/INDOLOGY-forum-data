Purana/All-India Kashiraj Trust
Our serials librarian has asked me to find out whether the All-India Kashiraj Trust is still actively publishing Purana, which our library has not received since 2004. I'd be grateful for any information about the series, or an email address or other recent contact information for the publishers.
Thanks,
Will
