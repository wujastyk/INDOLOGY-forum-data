Publication announcement
Erich Frauwallner, Philosophie des Buddhismus. Akademie Verlag, Berlin
2010. 282 pp.
This fifth edition in a new format is prefaced by Karin Preisendanz 
and myself. The (German) preface (pp. XII-LIII) deals with Frauwallner's
life and work, reproduces his original scheme for the History of Indian
Philosophy, contains a full bibliography of his writings, and provides an
annotated bibliography of selected further readings on South Asian Buddhism
with emphasis on philosophy. 
Some of you may remember the heated discussion in this list about German and
Austrian Indology and National Socialism. The preface shows that the two are
not unconnected in Frauwallner's case.
With best wishes for the New Year,
Eli Franco
