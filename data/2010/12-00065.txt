As von Hin?ber's book just happens to be open on my desk, and since Arlo might not have access to it, here's the gist of it: 

Von Hin?ber follows M. and W. Geiger ("P?li Dhamma vornehmlich in der kanonischen Literatur", Kleine Schriften, Wiesbaden 1973, esp. p. 191) in assuming the meaning "Sache, Gegenstand" for dhamma in this compound. Hence the original meaning must be "something that is to be given". And this corresponds to canonical and Therav?da usage of the term. Deyadharma gradually replaces the older d?na (so also Bhattacharya, D?na-Deyadharma, p. 51f.).

I don't know what Harry wrote, since must have directed himself to you
privately, but my own notes indicate one should consult:

Oskar von Hin?ber, Die Palola ??his: Ihre Steininschriften, Inschriften auf
Bronzen, Handschriftenkolophone und Schutzzauber. Materialien zur Geschichte
von Gilgit und Chilas. Antiquities of Northern Pakistan: Reports and Studies
5 [Mainz: Verlag Philipp von Zabern, 2004]: 177ff.
