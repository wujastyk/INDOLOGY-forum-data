Subject: INDOLOGY and SARIT server migration
Message-ID: <161227090581.23782.17189008966193449919.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

The server on which the INDOLOGY.info website is hosted (along with
BOMBAY.indology.info, SARIT.indology.info, FAQ.indology.info, etc.) will be
changing next week.  We're moving from a hosting company in California to
one in Austria that offers some advantages.  The change will be made at 11am
Central European Time, on Wednesday 27th October.

If all goes well, the change will not be noticeable.  There will be no
change in the public addresses (indology.info etc.).  The change has no
connection with this INDOLOGY discussion forum (which continues to be
generously hosted by Liverpool University).  However, it seems wise to give
notice, in case of the unforeseen.

Best,
Dominik Wujastyk
SARIT, INDOLOGY.
