Elizarenkova's Atharvaveda translation
Dear list members,
does anyone know whether the third volume of Tatjana Elizarenkova's 
Atharvaveda translation (i.e. ??????????? (???????) ????? XIII-XX) has 
already been published?
I was only able to get the first two volumes through inter-library loans.
Best wishes, and a happy New Year,
Marc
