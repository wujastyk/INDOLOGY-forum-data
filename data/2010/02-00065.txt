Subject: Southern pronunciations ? (Re: INDOLOGY FAQ

But, at least we can say it is a good thing that these words (mispronounced 
and misspelled as they are) have come into the general lexicon.

By the way, I must admit to having more than once ordered a Paanini when I 
should have been asking for a Paniini; confusing a grammarian with a grilled 
turkey sandwich.  I guess this goes both ways!   (In fact, as a a result of 
my misadventures in pronunciation, I am now utterly terrified by having to 
order one of these sandwiches.)  But, then, I also once asked for "bed bugs" 
rather than "curds" in my terribly broken Telegu.
