E. Gene Smith
Dear colleagues,
It is with much sorrow that I inform you of the passing of
E. Gene Smith, former director of the US Library of Congress
field office in India and founder of the Tibetan Buddhist
Resource Center in New York.
He was of course a friend to many of us, in Tibetan
Studies and many other fields, and will be profoundly
missed.
