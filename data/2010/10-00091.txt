Patrick, 
Not on Sanskrit literature per se, but a valuable short study of the
Samaraichchakah? is Thakur, Vijay Kumar and Jha, Kalpana. 1994. ?Towns and
Traide in the Samaraichchakah?: Text and Context.? In N.N. Bhattacharyya,
ed. Jainism and Prakrit in Ancient and Medieval India: Essays for Prof.
Jagdish Chandra Jain.  New Delhi: Manohar Publishers.  Pp. 295-324.

Both Vijay Thakur and Kalpana Jha have produced subsequent works on early
medieval trade, including Jha's Urbanisation in early medieval north India :
an analysis of the Samaraichchakaha / Kalpana Jha ; with an introduction by
Vijay Kumar Thakur. Patna : Janaki Prakashan, 1990.

Siefgried Lienhard's "Avalokite?vara in the Wick of the Night-Lamp,"
Indo-Iranian Journal 36 (1933): 93-104 is about the S?rthav?ha story in the
K?ra??avy?ha, and Himanshu Ray's 1994 Winds of Change: Buddhism and the
Maritime Links of Early South Asia (Delhi: OUP) certainly provides many
references to Buddhist literature.

The more recent histories of R.S. Sharma, especially his Early medieval
Indian society : a study in feudalisation, Hyderabad: Orient Longman, 2001,
are of some assistance.

Best,
Ron
