Dear Colleagues,

Indica et Buddhica - Catalogus has been updated with a new search
interface to help you find, retrieve and download digital content
across the internet. It can be found here:

 Indica et Buddhica - Catalogus: Open Content Search Interface
 http://catalogus.indica-et-buddhica.org/open-content/


The existing interfaces have also been updated, and now include a
connection to the collection at the Dharma Drum Buddhist College. I'm
grateful to Marcus Bingenheimer for making this possible.

As usual, all bibliographic records can be viewed in various forms -
Summary, Brief and Full - and downloaded in various formats - EndNote,
RIS, BibTeX, and Dublin Core.

If you have any suggestions for improvement please mail me.


Kind regards,

 Richard Mahoney
