  *Senior Research Associate and Director*
The Executive Committee of the South Asia Language Resource Center is
seeking to hire a Senior Research Associate/Director. The Director is
responsible for ensuring the effective operation of SALRC, one of fifteen
Language Resource Centers nationwide funded by the U.S. Department of
Education. Along with its sister centers, this Center exists to improve the
capacity to teach and learn foreign languages effectively. The Director is
charged with program planning and execution, policy making, fund raising,
grants administration, office management, and staff supervision. The
position involves the exercise of independent judgment and requires a
mature, experienced academic administrator to competently manage the
multiple responsibilities associated with the position. Candidates should
hold a Master's or higher degree and be familiar with a modern South Asian
language. Preference will be given to candidates with a thorough academic
knowledge of South Asian studies and with a Ph.D. degree. Candidates should
possess proven organizational abilities and experience in similar
large-scale, complex programs as well as excellent intellectual,
administrative, and human relations skills. Effective oral and written
communication skills and computer literacy are essential. Candidates must
demonstrate the ability to conceptualize and implement major initiatives
such as program planning and preparation of grant proposals. The ability to
lead in a manner conducive to positive morale in a large, collaborative
program is also important. Proficiency in South Asian linguistics or
language pedagogy and grant writing experience is highly desirable. The
position is either a half-time or full-time appointment contingent upon
renewed external funding for SALRC.
