"Saisha" as the name of a goddess?
What about zacii-pati (?ac?-pati)  "lord of strength" (= Indra), a  
dozen times  in the RV,
but then understood as "husband of ?ac?", whence Indra's wife got  
her name ?ac?.
Which will remind some of us of the unforgettable lecture of Alex  
Wayman at  the AOS, some 10 years ago...
Homeric names!
Cheers,
Michael
