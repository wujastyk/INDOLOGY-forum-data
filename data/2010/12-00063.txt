I don't know what Harry wrote, since must have directed himself to you

Oskar von Hin?ber, Die Palola ??his: Ihre Steininschriften, Inschriften auf
Bronzen, Handschriftenkolophone und Schutzzauber. Materialien zur Geschichte
von Gilgit und Chilas. Antiquities of Northern Pakistan: Reports and Studies
5 [Mainz: Verlag Philipp von Zabern, 2004]: 177ff.
