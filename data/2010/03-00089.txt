Anyone heard of a flower called "aniccam?"
The whole discussion (here and in Tamil) reminded me of the little  
yellow  flower,  called 'noli me tangere' "don't touch me!" in Latin.
For some details see: <http://www.aboutflowers.org/ 
giantbalsamim_xal.htm>  (also in N. India)
(Leaves of certain trees also do that: they fold on touch).
Cheers,
MW
