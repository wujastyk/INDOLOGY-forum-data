The Bharat Itihas Sanshodhak Mandal (BISM) has got approval from the
National Manuscript Mission to digitise nearly eight lakh manuscripts in the
coming year. Having completed its 100 years, the BISM is now awaiting funds
to be released to undertake the mammoth task. President Pratibha Patil will
attend the concluding ceremony at Balgandharva Rangmandir on Tuesday to mark
the centenary year of the institute. At the function, a souvenir on 100
years of the institute will be release and historian Babasaheb Purandare
will be felicitated.

One-line indexing of manuscripts and digitising Sanskrit manuscipts are
being done by the institute, said Dr Anuradha Kulkarni, secretary of BISM.
The institute provides resources and training for historical researchers and
was founded in 1910 by Indian historian V K Rajwade and Sardar KC Mehendale.


The institute at present houses nearly 40,000 Sanskrit manuscripts and 1,100
miniature paintings, which will be undertaken for restoration.
