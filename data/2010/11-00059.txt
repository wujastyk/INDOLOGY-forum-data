69. 3040
Hearing those words, a R?k?asa came
     whose name was Akampana, of great learning
and one among them who had good to him,
     and he said, ?Lord! Let me say something.
It is right to be very fierce in battle,
     O you who are most virile among
all heroes!  but around this action
     we pursue, there have been evil omens.
70. 3041
?The clouds have been roaring, pouring down
     a very great rain of blood
and the Sun God, look at him,
     he is surrounded by a halo!
Notice how there are flocks of crows
     that hover above your flag
and fight each other, fall, cry out,
     and fallen roll on the earth...."
The relevant Tamil is:
kuruti m? ma?ai corinta?a
	m?ka?ka? kumu?i
No doubt there are other instances in Kampa?, since he was following V?lm?ki.  I have not found anything in Sangam Literature.  George Hart
