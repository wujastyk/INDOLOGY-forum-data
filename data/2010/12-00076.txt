Subject: Date of usage of the word Bhaarata to denote India

bharata- , bhaarata- has been used since Rgvedic times, but not for  
"India".

The Bharata were just one of dozens of Rgvedic tribes (or if you  
like, polities), and the Bhaarata dynasty (started by Sudaas after  
his victory  in the "10 Kings' Battle", RV 7.18) existed for the next  
few hundred years.

See undersigned on the Kuru realm, EJVS 4 <http:// 
www.ejvs.laurasianacademy.com/>  and the still useful Macdonell- 
Keith's Vedic Index, II 94 sqq.

The Bharata occupied just Kuruksetra and surroudings (Haryana,  
Western UP): no "India" then.

Bharatavarsa is of course post-Vedic. Even Manu Smriti still has just  
Aryavarta.
