expectation (Re: Anyone heard of a flower called "aniccam?")
??????? V.S. Rajam,
I believe there are (at least) two distinct ways of answering your 
"naive / un-harmful" question.
*(1)* EITHER we consider that linguistic fieldwork is needed
(and that it MUST/CAN be done ONLY with native speakers, who tap on 
their native knowledge
[[which means that people will not pretend to really have known 
(INTUITIVELY and previously)
the answer to a question about something that they did not know about 
for sure
before making a GOOGLE search on Google Images]])
*(2)* OR we remember that the LIVERPOOL INDOLOGY list
(on which this message has appeared recently)
is a mailing  list frequented by the users of many INDIAN languages
(including sanskrit).
That being the case,
it makes sense to compare:
*a.* the data found on the PANDANUS web site
SEE: <http://iu.ff.cuni.cz/pandanus/database/>
(recently quoted by Dominic GOODALL),
which contains:
784 Malayalam plant names
675 Tamil plant names
670 Hindi plant names
650 Latin botanical names
616 Sanskrit plant names
543 English designations
146 names in Bengali
68 names in Prakrit
[Welcome additions would be: Kannada, Telugu, etc.]
*b* data compiled by the native users of many Indian languages 
(including Tamil)
*********************************
As a Post-Scriptum,
I would like to add that this exchange on the Liverpool Indology mailing 
list
is, to some extent, a post-scriptum
to an exchange which earlier took place on another mailing list
for which I am the owner [[DISCLAIMER STATEMENT]], on a French CNRS server.
A more complete set of textual data
will be found at the following URL-s

(the ORIGINAL post by Palaniappan Vairam Sarathy,  which triggered 
everything)
A recent post,
in which I am trying to make a synthesis of the NON-SPECULATIVE evidence
(including the ???????? / Pi?kalam [a moderately  old KO?A] evidence,
which my friend George Hart seems to have been using,
when mentioning alternate names for ????????),
is available at:

Best wishes to all
You are all of course welcome to join CTAMIL
