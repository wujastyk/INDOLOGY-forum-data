Anyone heard of a flower called "aniccam?"
Is it still common? The lajjaavatii or laajawantii was very common along rail tracks even in the seventies. But since its arrival, allegedly from Canada in 1973, the parthenium?has spread like wild fire along the ancient EIR route and the parallel Grand Trunk Road destroying the common lajjaavatii.

Mimosa pudica is certainly very common in Karnataka - it's called chhui mui
in Hindi, mutthidaremuni in Kannada I think, and lajjaa (as in bashfulness)
in Sanskrit.
