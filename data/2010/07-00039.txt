Since a few years we offer "Almindologie": intensive courses in Indian  
languages in a mountain chalet south of Munich, at approximately one  
hour's travel by train or car from the city. This time the  
Almindologie will last for 8 days. In this period, participants in our  
courses receive learning materials, lodging, and three freshly  
prepared meals a day in quiet, beautiful, peaceful surroundings that  
optimize learning, without urban disturbances. The costs vary  
according to the number of courses in which one wishes to participate.

This year we again offer an intensive course in Kannada for beginners  
(August 2nd-9th, with 4 hours of teaching per day). Experience shows  
that in this one intensive period one learns more than during a whole  
semester of regular teaching at the university. The supplied learning  
manual is in English, and teaching has till now been in German  
(because all the participants till now have been German speakers), but  
if at least a significant minority prefers English, it will be  
English. Besides Kannada, there is also a first introduction to Telugu  
(August 2nd-5th ) and an advanced course in Sanskrit (August 5th-9th).

As the number of participants is limited due to the available lodging  
facilities, it is recommended that interested persons register soon.
