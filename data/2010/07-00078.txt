About "The feet being one of the most impure parts of the body should  
never touch
> sacred items."

In this context, it would be interesting also to learn why gold was  
never worn below waist,
at least in some traditional S. Indian environments that I'm familiar  
with.
In my generation, some traditional ornaments such as toe rings or  
anklets were never made in gold.
The only big pomp that would adorn the waist was the "waist-belt" in  
gold with numerous gems embedded.

Regards,
Rajam
