Dear Indologists,

     While the term da?agranth? brahmin is well known and refers to a brahmin who has studied the four Vedas and the six Ved??gas, I have come across the term pa?cagranth? brahmin in one of the sources.  Has anybody encountered this term, and, if so, what might these five granthas be?  Best,

I would appreciate if someone could provide me contact information for Stephan Hillyer Levitt (New York).  He was a class-mate of mine at the University of Pennsylvania.
