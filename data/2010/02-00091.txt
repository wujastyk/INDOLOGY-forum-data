Southern pronunciations ? (Re: INDOLOGY FAQ
Dear Gary,
the data added by Velcheru Narayana Rao
is quite interesting.
Apparently,
we have inside the MEMORY PATTERNS
of speakers of Kannada, Telugu and Tamil
a dominant metrical pattern for the name Benares
which is:
"LONG SHORT LONG"
whereas the dominant metrical pattern
for Malayalam is:
"LONG LONG SHORT"
It would be interesting to find out whether
the vectors (the people who inoculated)
the Benares shaiva supremacy notion
into Tamil Nadu
were people whose (real) mother tongue did not have the distinction
between long and short.
What about other living Indian languages?
Cheers
