Dear Indology List Members,

I seem to remember BhartRhari referring by way of analogy to a perfume vendor in the VAkyapadIya, one with a keen sense of smell that could distinguish individual scents from amongst many of them in the shop. I cannot now find the reference, however.

Does anyone know the source of this passage, or have I just dreamed this up? Any help offered on- or off-list would be most appreciated. Thank you.

Sincerely,

John Nemec
