Subject: [INDOLOGY] Enquiry with regard to colour symbolism in
Hindu Traditions

Dear Colleagues,

An undergraduate student recently asked me about colour symbolism
in Hindu Traditions.

I realised very quickly that I knew very little about this.

Can anyone suggest readings (primary and secondary) on this
topic?

With Thanks and Best Wishes,

James Hegarty
