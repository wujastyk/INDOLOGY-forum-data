[INDOLOGY] Enquiry with regard to colour symbolism in
Hindu Traditions
Dear Colleagues,
An undergraduate student recently asked me about colour symbolism
in Hindu Traditions.
I realised very quickly that I knew very little about this.
Can anyone suggest readings (primary and secondary) on this
topic?
With Thanks and Best Wishes,
James Hegarty
