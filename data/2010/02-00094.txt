My submission concerned the pronunciation by some?reputed scholars. I think book agents?should not be normally expected to welcome the spelling P??ini. For them, perhaps, Panini is sufficient:

But, at least we can say it is a good thing that these words (mispronounced and misspelled as they are) have come into the general lexicon.

By the way, I must admit to having more than once ordered a Paanini when I should have been asking for a Paniini; confusing a grammarian with a grilled turkey sandwich.? I guess this goes both ways!???(In fact, as a a result of my misadventures in pronunciation, I am now utterly terrified by having to order one of these sandwiches.)? But, then, I also once asked for "bed bugs" rather than "curds" in my terribly broken Telegu.

>>> I am tempted to add, in the section on mispronunciations, an entry on "vaaraaNasii" (as the name of the city), with a note to the effect that, for the same reasons as given for "mahaabhaarata" and "raamaayaNa," the third syllable in this name is the least appropriate place to apply a stress accent.? But I have been struck over the years by the frequency with which many people I respect as experts on Banaras habitually lengthen and stress the vowel in the third syllable---so much so that I wonder whether they might be following some local tradition unknown to me, despite the official spelling of the name.? Are they?? Is there any good reason to make the third "a" vowel in "Varanasi" long?
