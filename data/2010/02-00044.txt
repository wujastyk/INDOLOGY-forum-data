Dear Friends and Colleagues,

been published.  Below you will find the table of contents.

We are currently accepting submissions for issue 9(4).  In addition to the
traditional coverage of regional and national politics, foreign policy, and
sociology, please note that the editors of *India Review* are actively
seeking to expand the intellectual scope of the journal to include issues of
religious discourse, practice, and community in Indian history and
contemporary society.  I invite all interested on the INDOLOGY listserve to
