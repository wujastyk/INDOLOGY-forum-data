Dear Colleagues,

Does anyone have access to a digital copy of the Prayogaparijata of Nrsirmha?  I believe I saw a pothi print copy in Pune with the Late Kinjavadekar Shastri, but I see no library entries for it on the web.  I see references to it in manuscript catalogues.  But any digital version?

Will Sweetman has pointed me to: :

It certainly appears  from p 8 here that Kern was not there (although Speyer
was--this was from his days in Amsterdam--he came to Leiden only after
Kern's death, I believe). It is somewhat awe-inspiring to read the list of
attendees...

Thanks so much--I think this answers my immediate question. Though now I
wonder why Kern was not there--he is mentioned in the minutes as being one
of the people who should organize the next meeting were it to be held in
Leiden.

thanks so much!!  jonathan
