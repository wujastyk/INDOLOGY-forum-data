                       Academic Program
The conference will be structured such that all panel and section 
presentations will be scheduled for specific times. Individual papers 
will begin on the hour and half-hour as per the conference schedule (to 
be published April, 2011). This will allow conference members to attend 
their presentations of choice. *Panels* will consist of either five or 
six speakers, organized by convenors who are responsible for their 
thematic unity, academic content, and internal structure. *Sections* on 
general themes will be formed by the conference planning committee from 
accepted abstracts, and will also consist of either five or six 
speakers. Each panel and section will fill one or more three-hour time 
slots. Panels with only five presenters may end after two and a half hours.
                       Panels
For a list of accepted panels, please consult http://iabs2011.ddbc.edu.tw.
                       Sections
The planning committee will identify general themes in Buddhist Studies 
to serve as section titles. Section titles will be decided upon in 
December, 2010 and will be announced at that time.
                       Abstracts
The committee now invites scholars from all areas of Buddhist Studies to 
submit section paper abstracts. Abstracts should be 500 words or less. 
Please submit by _December 5, 2010_ to our conference website at 
http://iabs2011.ddbc.edu.tw/ <mailto:iabs2008 at emory.edu>. A video 
tutorial on submitting abstracts is available online:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tINN8MzvuWY
 The committee reserves the right to accept or reject abstracts. 
Accepted abstracts will be assigned to an appropriate section. Final 
decisions on all abstracts will be conveyed to participants in February, 
2011. Accepted abstracts will be mounted on the conference website 
without further editorial attention, so please edit your abstract carefully.
 Note: panel convenors should accept or reject abstracts for their own 
panels. Authors of accepted panel abstracts should be asked to submit 
their accepted abstracts to the conference website by _December 5, 2010_ 
(Bill will produce a second tutorial video explaining how to do this). 
Panel convenors should also write to conference organizers by this date

                       Accommodations
Since accommodations on Dharma Drum Mountain itself are limited to 
dormitory-style rooms, many attendees will prefer to stay in nearby 
beach-front and hot-springs spa hotels. We are negotiating discounted 
rates at a number of locations. A separate *Accommodations Circular* 
will be sent out December, 2010 at latest. Attendees will be able to 
reserve rooms at that time.

All conference participants must be current subscribing IABS members in 
the year of the conference. To join the International Association of 
Buddhist Studies, please follow the instructions found on the IABS 
website at www.iabsinfo.net <http://www.iabsinfo.net/>. Those who are 
not current members by the start of the conference will be asked to 
subscribe on site.
                       Third Circular
The third circular will be sent out in April, 2011. This will include a 
schedule for the academic program as well as further details about 
conference events. We regret that those who have not submitted an
