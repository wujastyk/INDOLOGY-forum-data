Well, mzybe not so cool: Sanskrit script?
[...]
This may be true in general, but I find it difficult to apply the above 
criteria to Kashmir.
First, the name of the Sharada script refers already to a deity, namely to 
Sharada or Sarasvati Devi, the goddess of learning and eloquence. Why 
exchange a prestigious name and the script it designates for another, such 
as Deva-Nagari?
Second, Kashmir was never under British rule,
and third, Hindi played no role there at all and can therefore not be seen 
in the context of a linguistic innovation.
The manuscripts in old Kashmiri I am aware of are written in Sharada.
Modern Kashmiri is commonly written in the Urdu script - as a successor to 
the Persian characters in use for Persian texts in late medieval times, but 
significantly enough not in Devanagari.
