Date of usage of the word Bhaarata to denote India
Not sure whether this is useful, anyway: in Indonesian/Malay barat  
means 'West'. Although I am not 100% certain, I believe that the word  
derives from the Sanskrit bh?rata (I do not have Gonda and other  
lierature at hand at the moment so I can't check; I am also not sure  
about when the term became of common use). Compare also 'orang  
barat' (people from the West, Westerners). It would appear that in pre- 
modern Indonesia bh?rata denoted 'India', which is westward with  
respect to Indonesia. One may compare the use of the term 'yavana' in  
India itself to denote people coming from the West ('greeks', 'arabs',  
etc.).
Best wishes,
A.
