About the film:
*We set out to document a seven-day festival that was held in the hamlet 
of Naluna in the Garhwal Himalaya, India, in November 2009. The festival 
centred on the sacred text of the Bhagavatapurana which tells the story 
of the beloved Indian deity, Krishna. The festival was conducted under 
the auspices of the local village deity Kandar. Our film captures the 
sights and sounds of this beautiful mountain community, as well as the 
fascinating interaction between the story-telling tradition from the 
North Indian plain, and Kandar, the village god.
My cameraman and editor Julian Dennis and I have worked long and hard on 
this film, and we look forward to reading your feedback on Youtube.
Please circulate this message as widely as possible.
With thanks in advance
McComas
