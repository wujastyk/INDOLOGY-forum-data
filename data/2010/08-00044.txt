I think AAyurveda is not meant. It extensively deals with madness .

Dear List,

Does anyone know if the diagnosis &? treatment of madness/ mental illness is
prescribed in the dharma??stra corpus?

I am interested in any *legal* definition and its application which may be
separate from any mention in the? Ayurvedic a?gas of bh?ta vidya and
manovij??n.

Thanks,
