There is an interesting booklet on the unicorn printed as the booklet for an
exhibition in the university library of Leiden in 2002: 

W. P. Gerritsen, De eenhorn en de geleerden. Het debat over het bestaan van
de eenhorn van de zestiende tot de negentiende eeuw.
Universiteitsbibliotheek Leiden, Leiden 2002. 

The booklet (86 pages including illustrations) gives a review of the
theories concerning the unicorn in the West from Antiquity to modern times. 

Recommended, if you can get hold of it.
