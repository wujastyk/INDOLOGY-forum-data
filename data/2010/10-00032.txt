Theories of light, vision or optics
We have a doctoral student at the University of Virginia who explored this theme in Tibetan Buddhism.  His name is Chris Hatchell, and he may be reached at ch5bw at virginia.edu   
He worked with David Germano on the Ph.D., but I have not seen the thesis, yet.
Cheers,
John
