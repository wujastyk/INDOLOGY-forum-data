Experience with "Critical" edition of Kanjur and Tanjur
dear Colleagues,
I'm wondering if some of you who have had a chance to actually look into the
editions of the Kanjur and Tanjur published by the China Tibetology
Publishing House would be willing to share your opinion of these volumes. I
do not expect them to be critical, but I wonder if they are good enough to
be useful, or if in fact one is just as well off, if not better, simply
going to a xylograph (such as Derge).
I have the memory, from having seen a volume from the Tanjur years ago, that
they have not internally analyzed the texts, even by paragraphing. Is this
correct?
What sort of argument could one make for purchasing a set?
Many thanks,
Jonathan Silk
