Dear colleagues,

Thanks to those who responded to my query. You very
well confirmed my hunch that the issue has not 
been very much treated so far: just the article by
Funayama and some in the Zaastraarambha vol. ed. by
Walter Slaje. To these I may add that there is
one article discussing the matter in respect to 
its treatment by the 16th c. Tibetan figure
Padma dkar-po: M. Broido, "Notes on dgos 'brel" in
Bulletin of the Tibet Society 1983.

So not a lot, to date, on a topic that's almost ubiquitous in
the Sanskrit and Tibetan zaastric literature (and no doubt
Pali as well, though I've not yet verified this).
