making diacritics (on my Mac)
Thanks for this.  This solves finding the input for r subscript circle (in this keyboard, option r) as well as the chandrabindu.  Note, though, that in some fonts the spacing is off for r subscript circle -- with the circle too far to the right -- but in several it is just fine)
Best,
