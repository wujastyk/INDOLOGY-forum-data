upodghata
A quick Google search brought up this verse, from the beginning of folio 2a in Tisa?a's Cikits?kalik? with commentary, in number 947 (Chambers 711) on page 293 of Verzeichniss der Sanskrit-Handschriften, volume 1 of Die Handschriften-Verzeichnisse der Koeniglichen Bibliothek (Berlin, 1853).  The book is available on Googlebooks.

Cikits?kalik? has been published together with a commentary by his son Candra?a, but I do not have volume in my personal library. The verse, which evidently is cited in Candra?a's commentary, does not appear in the excerpts from the commentary in Julius Jolly, Zur Quellenkunde der Indischen Medezin 4..., ZDMG 60:413-468.
