Depictions of children in pre-modern Indian art
Dear Dominik,
On the historical background of demons attacking children and their  
connection with the planets (Sanskrit graha), and cults purporting  
getting children, see my book "Deciphering the Indus script"  
(Cambridge 1994, reprinted in paperback in 2009), especially pp.  
225-239, and my paper "'Hind-leg' + 'Fish': Towards further  
understanding of the Indus script" in Scripta Vol. 1 (2009), pp. 37-76  
(downloadable from www.harappa.com)
With best regards, Asko Parpola
