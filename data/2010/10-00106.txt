Dear Shelly,

The listing that follows is for a two-year position in a research project
that Glenn Most and I will be organizing at the Max Planck Institute for
History of Science in Berlin, to examine in a comparative way the history of
textual practices in several cultures:

http://www.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/en/news/jobs.html

We hope that junior scholars in many fields that have elaborate textual
traditions will apply, and were wondering if there is a particular web site
where we could have this posted, and where it would be likely to attract the
attention of young South Asian scholars.
[...]
Thanks so much.

Yours,

Tony
