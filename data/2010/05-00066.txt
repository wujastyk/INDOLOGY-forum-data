Dear All,
in an old commentary (from a Buddhist context) of about the first  
century AD, and probably of South Indian origin, i.e. in the  
Andhaka??hakath?, I have the statement that after burning a  
corpse a hut (ku?ik?) is erected (kar?yati) for the ashes and the  
bones.
Does anybody know whether this is some general habit or perhaps a  
local custom or perhaps restricted to a specific time.
Any suggestions are welcome,
Petra
