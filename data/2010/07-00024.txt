While we (I?) are on a TeX-n-Devanagari roll, Zdenek's recent adaptation of
the indexing program Xindy <http://xindy.sourceforge.net/> to the sorting
and indexing of Devanagari may not have been seen by those who don't
subscribe to the Devnag mailing list.

*xindy* is an index processor that can be used to generate book-like indexes

Hi
all,

I have just released the first testing version of xindy modules
for

Hindi and Marathi. It supports sorting both in Unicode and in
a

transliteration. The work was started two years ago and took a
long

time because I was busy with other projects. It is therefore
based

upon xindy as released with TeX Live 2008. The package is
available

from http://icebearsoft.euweb.cz/xindy-devanagari/



As described, some problems have not been solved so far. Comments
and

suggestions are
appreciated.
