Xindy for Devanagari
While we (I?) are on a TeX-n-Devanagari roll, Zdenek's recent adaptation of
the indexing program Xindy <http://xindy.sourceforge.net/> to the sorting
and indexing of Devanagari may not have been seen by those who don't
subscribe to the Devnag mailing list.
*xindy* is an index processor that can be used to generate book-like indexes

Hi
all,
I have just released the first testing version of xindy modules
for
Hindi and Marathi. It supports sorting both in Unicode and in
a
transliteration. The work was started two years ago and took a
long
time because I was busy with other projects. It is therefore
based
upon xindy as released with TeX Live 2008. The package is
available
from http://icebearsoft.euweb.cz/xindy-devanagari/
As described, some problems have not been solved so far. Comments
and
suggestions are
appreciated.
Zden?k
