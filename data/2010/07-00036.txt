Dear Colleagues,
why look for pdf files? There are now superb online dictionaries.

In particular Chaturvedi's English-Hindi dictionary at 
http://dsal.uchicago.edu/dictionaries/caturvedi/
also the whole of the eleven volumes of the most respected Hindi to Hindi dictionary the Sabdasagar is also now on the dsal site.

regards

Peter
