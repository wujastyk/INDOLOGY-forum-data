Subject: Experience with "Critical" edition of Kanjur and Tanjur
Message-ID: <161227090366.23782.2476297864737425037.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

My sincere thanks to all who sent such useful advice about the Chinese
editions of Kanjur and Tanjur. Unfortunately, our librarian now informs us
that the editions cost 20,000 euros (I suspect that this also does not
include shipping), so, well, no purchase here I'm afraid. It is however nice
to know that it seems to be a useful publication.

With thanks, Jonathan Silk
