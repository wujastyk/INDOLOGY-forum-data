flowers: interest in small or only in large?
Do people share my feeling that Indian literature is little interested in the beauty of small herbaceous flowering plants, but only in large trees, shrubs, and vines?  Any difference in this between Sanskrit, Prakrit, and Tamil literatures?  Any changes under Islamic or British influence?
Medical interest is of course another thing.
