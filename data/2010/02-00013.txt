Abhidharmakosha in e-format
The full first chapter only -- Sanskrit and the two Chinese versions -- is 
at
http://www.mldc.cn/sanskritweb/resour/etext/abhk1.html
(set your browser to utf-8 unicode).
The version on the Thesaurus Literaturae Buddhicae site is only up to karika 
10 of the first chapter as far as I can tell.
There is no online e-version of the whole text with bhasya.
