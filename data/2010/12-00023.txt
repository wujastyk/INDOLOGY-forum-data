new EJVS issue 17-2: Vajracharya on Unicorns
Correct, I reached the same conclusion in a recent publication: a bastard of a two-horned creature and a zero-horned creature is one-horned, mathematically speaking. Likely too much importance is given in the literature to this rather innocent story. The unicorn myth seems to have still an impact on modern people, including scholars.

The problem is even deeper: None of the passages that Vajracharya 
cites establish that there was a belief in a one-horned gazelle; the 
only thing that can be established is that the sage ?syas??ga 
had just one horn. In fact, if one wanted to speculate, this could be 
attributed to the fact that only one of his parents was a gazelle, the 
other one was human.
