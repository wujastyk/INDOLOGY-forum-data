 In the VAlmIki RAmAyaNa (critical ed.) at 6. 105. the gods praise Rama as the Primal Being etc. Among many other things they tell him (6.105.20), ?You support all beings as well as the earth with all its mountains.? (tvaM dhArayasi bhUtAni vasudhAM ca saparvatAm) The commentator MahezvaratIrtha (ca. 15th century) sees this as a reference to ViSNu in the form of the primal tortoise, remarking, ?Now they praise (him) as the primal tortoise. (saMpraty AdikUrmAtmanA stauti). This may perhaps be a reference to the KUrmAvatAra which was mentioned by John but there it is, as he notes,  only Mt. Mandara that is supported and not the entire earth. For what it is worth MahezvaratIrtha evidently has in mind a single tortoise that supports the whole earth.

Here there is no mention of elephants, but Mt Meru is used as a churning stick or paddle to churn the ocean, and Vishnu takes the form of a tortoise (k?rma) on which Mt Meru is set, while the king of the snakes is used as the rope by which gods and Asura rotate the mountain.  At some stage the system of the four elephants of the quarters seems to have been conflated with this ... possibly in the Svayambh? Pur??? (a late Nepalese Pur??a); certainly it is not found in any of the major Pur??as."
