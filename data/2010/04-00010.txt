Turtles (and elephants) all the way down?
 In the VAlmIki RAmAyaNa (critical ed.) at 6. 105. the gods praise Rama as the Primal Being etc. Among many other things they tell him (6.105.20), ?You support all beings as well as the earth with all its mountains.? (tvaM dhArayasi bhUtAni vasudhAM ca saparvatAm) The commentator MahezvaratIrtha (ca. 15th century) sees this as a reference to ViSNu in the form of the primal tortoise, remarking, ?Now they praise (him) as the primal tortoise. (saMpraty AdikUrmAtmanA stauti). This may perhaps be a reference to the KUrmAvatAra which was mentioned by John but there it is, as he notes,  only Mt. Mandara that is supported and not the entire earth. For what it is worth MahezvaratIrtha evidently has in mind a single tortoise that supports the whole earth.
