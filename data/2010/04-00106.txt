Subject: critiques of sacrifice
Message-ID: <161227089334.23782.8135160240598444632.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>


Dear List,

It is possible to contrast the various textual examples cited in this thread by pointing to other examples from inscriptional sources? I am familiar with inscriptions wherein Buddhist kings are known to have promoted rather than rejected certain types of Brahmanical sacrifice. This is seen, for example, in P?la and Candra inscriptions of Bengal where rituals from the Atharvaveda Pari?i??as, at least in name (such as the ko?ihoma and the adbhuta??nti of the homacatu??aya), are invoked for the purposes of returning favor for gifts of land. Further, as I recall, even at st?pa sites such as at N?g?rjunako??a there are inscriptions promoting the a?vamedha sacrifice.

To my mind such inscriptional evidence raises the question of how we receive the Buddhist critiques of sacrifice. Are the textual sources, for example, derived only from a canonical framework?  Is the critique offered in ritual sources such as Tantras? I am curious as, looking to the inscriptional evidence, I wonder if the Buddhist critique of sacrifice is only rendered by Buddhist monks who are themselves in competition with Brahminical ritualists and thus, wishing to discredit their ritual rivals in the hopes of gaining royal favor? 

It would be helpful to understand what is behind the question about Buddhist or Jain rejection of sacrifice. Admittedly, my knowledge of Buddhist canonical literature is not, what it should be! I would appreciate any comments with respect to clarification or otherwise. This is certainly an interesting topic! I am in fact working on two related projects and am happy to receive further references on this general topic. 

Best Wishes,

Benjamin
