Depictions of children in pre-modern Indian art
With many thanks indeed to Claudine Bautze-Picron for the references below,
which I didn't know, and to all the other colleagues who have offered useful
pointers and suggestions.
I realize I should have mentioned the genesis of my query.  The Sanskrit
texts on Graha??nti, or the pacification of demons, are commonly cast as
discourses about how these demons attach children and make them ill.  For
example, the Ravanakum?ratantra, that was studied by Filliozat in the 40s.
However, when one looks at illustrated Graha??nti MSS (Wellcome MS Indic
alpha 1936, 15th century Nepal, for example,  see
here<http://medphoto.wellcome.ac.uk/indexplus/obf_images/9a/15/30a95ed38aedfd8ee660dac8b5f5.jpg>),
the demons are depicted attacking what appear to be adults.  I always
assumed the victims were adult, but my students raised the question with me
that perhaps the victims were intended to be children, but just looked like
adults to us.
