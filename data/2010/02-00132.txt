Clay Sanskrt Lirary (Was: INDOLOGY FAQ. Re. Varanasi
Thanks.
Allen 
I am sorry to have to tell you that I have absolutely no connection  
nowadays with the Clay Sanskrit Library and simply do not know the  
answer to your important question. It is possible that Prof Sheldon  
Pollock is better informed, as he remained employed for some time  
after I left.
