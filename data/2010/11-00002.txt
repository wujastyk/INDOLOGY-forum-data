Enquiry with regard to colour symbolism in Hindu Traditions
Dear Colleagues,
An undergraduate student recently asked me about colour symbolism in  
Hindu Traditions.
I realised very quickly that I knew very little about this.
Can anyone suggest readings (primary and secondary) on this topic?
With Thanks and Best Wishes,
