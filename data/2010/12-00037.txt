Subject: changes in the financial structure of higher education in the UK
Message-ID: <161227091070.23782.16894718591054530585.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

A few days ago, the government of the UK voted to allow universities to
charge students in England up to ?9000 per annum for doing an undergraduate
degree.  This does not apply to Scotland, where education is still free.  So
there's a very substantial financial difference for a student between
choosing to do a Sanskrit degree in Oxford (potentially ?27,000) or
Edinburgh (free).

KEY FACTS (from the BBC website):

   - Fees in England to rise from 2012 to a maximum of ?9,000 a year
   - Universities charging more than ?6,000 will have to meet requirements
   designed to help poorer students
   - Graduates will begin paying back loans covering their fees once they
   are earning at least ?21,000 a year
   - They will pay back 9% of their earnings above this level
   - No tuition fees in Scotland, but universities there are calling for
   'graduate contributions'
   - Fees in Wales are to rise in line with those in England - but Welsh
   students will be subsidised wherever they study in the UK so will pay no
   more than the current fees of ?3,290 a year
   - A review of the system in Northern Ireland is under way

Note also that a 40% cut is forecast in funding for university teaching, a
shortfall that will fall affect the humanities.  Other sources say it is a
100% cut, i.e., a complete freeze on all employment in the humanities
sector.  The worst fears expressed in this article, signed by many
distinguished professors, are now certain to take place:
