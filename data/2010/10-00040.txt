Theories of light, vision or optics
I don't have any positive suggestions, but do have a negative one.  Warn him against Bharadvaja Rishi, Amsu Bodhini Shastra, Bangalore: V.B. Soobbiah, 1931. (In WorldCat with OCLC numbers 557431896 and 317341229.)  It purports to be an ancient work on optics lost and recovered in the twentieth century by yogic insight, and is one of several similar works published around the same time, the most notable being the Brhadvimanasastra on flying machines attributed to the same sage, whence von Daniken, et hinc illae lacrimae.  I have been gradually putting together a dossier on these publications.

[INDOLOGY] Theories of light, vision or optics
  Dear all,
A colleague historian of physics asks me for good secondary literature on theories of light, vision or optics, in ancient and medieval India. 
I've copied for him Subbarayapa's chapter on the history of physics in a Concise History of Science, INSA, 1971, for starters, but was wondering if were available more recent and detailed studies on such topics in more specific nyayavaizesika, buddhist or ayurvedic texts for example.
yours,
Agathe
