Might not the adoption of Davanagari in Kashmir
been due, at least in part, to the development of Sanskrit
printing there? By the mid-19th c., Devanagari type fonts
were in wide use, but I do not know of Sarada
printing type at all. Surely technology and
the distribution of printed texts played major roles 
in promoting Devanagari, not just in Kashmir,
but in many places throughout the subcontinent.
