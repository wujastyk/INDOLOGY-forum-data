Nara-Narayana
I do not know if the following information will be of any help. I vaguely remember that long ago it was either Hertha Krick or Bettina B?umer of whom an off-print of a study on the N?r?ya?abal?-Upani?ad was presented to me. Both were at Vienna then. It had something. But I cannot find it out now. The Vedic Bibliography did not help. My apologies if the paper is the same as the ?N?r?ya?a und Opfertod?.?
Best for all

Nara-Narayana
Dear Colleagues,
Can anyone recommend good books or articles on the theology and mythology
of Nara-Narayana?? I am especially interested in the way they were
understood in Pancaratra texts.
Many thanks!
