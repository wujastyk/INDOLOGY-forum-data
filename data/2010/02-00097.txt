I agree that it is important to have diacritics on romanized Sanskrit to ensure at least the graphic representation of Sanskrit sounds.  That however does not assure its pronunciation.  I remember attending the meetings of the AOS in old days where American Sanskritists  pronounced the Buddhist tathat? as "tatata" with all alveolar 't's and no distinction of vowel length, and mah?bh?rata as "mabarata" with no aspiration for 'b', alveolar 't', and of course no distinction of vowel length.  On one of these occasions, my guruji Prof George Cardona was so fed up, that he could not take the barrage of "tatata" and walked out of the room.

to print those languages without their accents, and nor is it acceptable for
Sanskrit.

There's lots to discuss about the various Clay decisions, but one thing I
quite like is the use of the acute accent to mark stress or ictus.  While
ictus isn't the same as vowel length, it's pretty close to gauravam, and
people who know nothing of Sanskrit and don't have access to a teacher do
rather well reading such accented words out loud.

Best,
