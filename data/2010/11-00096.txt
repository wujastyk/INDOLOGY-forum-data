In this general connection, please see Stephen Chrisomalis' new  "Numerical 
Notation: A Comparative History" (Cambridge, 2010), which (though not a 
collarorative effort as suggested) is intended to supersede Ifrah. My 
impression is that it will. The chapter on "South Asian Systems", at least, 
is very well done (although it does not address the issue of words for large 
numbers which started this thread, if memory serves), and the whole book is 
a very impressive performance.
