In Tamil, there seems to be a three-way rendition of the term  
"vaaraaNasii" (as the name of the city) [as originally provided by  
Gary Tubb]:

(i) ????????
"vAraNavAsi" (as attested in an earlier literature, kalittokai  
?????????, and later inscriptions). This form can be  
construed as the combination of: "vAraN(a) + v (glide) + Asi"

I also recall that ???????? "vAraNavAsi" is the form  
attested in ??????????? ???????  
ariccantira purANam, the epic describing the story of "Harischandra."  
I don't have a copy of the book to quote it.

Note that the vowels in the syllables of ????????  
"vAraNavAsi" are long-short-short-long-short.

(ii) ??????? "vAraNAsi" (as attested in certain types of  
literary texts such the Manimekalai ????????,  
Tevaram ???????, and ????????????
, Periyapuranam)
. This form can be construed as the combination of: "vAraN + Asi"

Note that the vowels in the syllables of ???????  
"vAraNAsi" are long-short-long-short.

(iii) ?????? "vAraNasii". In a recent blog, I found the  
following quote from the famous singer M.S. Subbulakshmi's  
"suprabatham" : "?????? ?????? ??  
??????????" ["vAraNasii kulapatE ... ... "], which  
is interesting since the vowel in the last syllable of the city's  
name under consideration is long. My memory of the "suprabatham"  
doesn't help me here. I don't have music recordings to confirm this  
fact either.

Note that the vowels in the syllables of ??????  
"vAraNasii" are long-short-short-long.

In any case, I can assure that phonology, meter in poetry, and music  
have had their roles in rendering different versions of the same name  
in Tamil.
