Digital Corpus of Sanskrit, update
Dear colleagues,
I would like to announce the first update of the Digital Corpus of Sanskrit
(DCS).
The new version of the text database contains the Katyayanasmrti and a
complete version of the Kurmapurana. In addition, an individual per-text
dictionary for each text is available via the corpus page of DCS (follow the
"D" links on the corpus page).
More details about these changes can be found at the following address:
