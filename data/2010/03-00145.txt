Dear All,
first thanks to all who helped me with the upodgh?ta? verse.
I am now in search of a Sanskrit parallel for the verse  from the  
Vajirabuddhi??k? cited below, or for a list of the five terms  
sa??? nimitta? katt? parim??a? payojana?. The only source  
for these five terms up to now is Candrak?rti (see Steinkellner,  
"Remarks on Tantristic Hermeneutics", Csoma de K?r?s Memorial  
Symposium, 1978), where they come under the first of the seven  
ala?k?ras, i.e. upodghata?, which form a group of exegetical  
tools used in interpreting Tantras.
verse from Vjb 1,17-18
sa??? nimitta? katt? ca parim??a? payojana?
sabb?gamassa pubbeva vattabba? vattu? icchat? ti
the meaning of the terms in Vjb is as follows:
sa??? = name of the text
nimitta? = motive for writing the text
katt? = author
parim??a? = extent, length of the text
payojana? =  purpose of the text
According to a v.l. in Vjb this verse is said for every Tantra  
(pavutt? sabbatant?na?)
Every hint is welcome,
Petra
