I think it is obvious that 'M?nchen' is closer to the original 12th- 
century 'Munichen' than the Italian 'Monaco' is. (I must confess that  
I don't know when the French turned Colonia to 'Cologne'. But even if  
the oldest attestation were to be newer than the native German  
development Colonia > C?llen > C?ln > K?ln, it is indeed arguably  
closer to the Latin original.)

Not likely, because 's-Hertogenbosch is an old town, much older than  
the one-time fashion among nobles to speak French. Moreover, there are  
too many Dutch place names that have a similar structure ('s- 
Gravenhage, 's-Gravensande,...) and have no French version at all.

Though we should not rule out that possibility, also in India one has  
to watch out. There are later Sanskritizations of originally non- 
Sanskritic place names that are presented as 'the original' (e.g.,  
Mais?ru would be derived from Sanskrit 'Mahi??surapura', or, more  
fancifully, U?upi from 'R?pyap??ha') -- just like the  
Latinization of M?nchen to the supposedly 'original' 'Monachium'.  
(There is even a Latin name for Toronto: Torontum. And there's  
Vinnipega, Vancuverium, Sanctus Johannes, Fredericopolis, Sinus  
Tonitralis, Mons Regius, Regiopolis [Kingston] too.)
