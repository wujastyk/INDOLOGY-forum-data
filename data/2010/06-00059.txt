Dear All,
The necessity for some strict conventions is often felt. The components should not be detached from one another but there is a convention of putting a hyphen and beginning the second member with a capital letter when two categories of ?signified? are placed one after another, e.g., individual and class, in, say, M?dhyandina-Sa?hit?, ?c?(or y?)r??ga-Sutta, K?lacakra-Tantra. The upper case in the second member is just a convention meant, perhaps, for clarity. But what about ?gveda that is RV in abridgement? Abhij??na?akuntalam is ok but Pravrajy?vastu? Hanumann??aka? ?
It is not only names of books but proper names should be uniformly transliterated. All scholars, at least most of them, will cite ???????????? ???????????????? occurring in a verse as Vi?v?mitro Jamadagnir Vasi??ha?. But are the upper cases necessary?
Any further thought?
Best
