Tara iconography
Dear Lars Martin,
What you have been given so far is mostly descriptive iconography. If  
yous scholar wants iconology as well as iconography, s/he should look at
the following in addition to those mentioned:
Read first:
Willson, Martin. In Praise of Tara (Includes very nice drawings of  
Astamaha-abhaya Tara)
Beyer, Stephen, Cult of Tara
Then then:
Anon. Cittamani Tara: The collected arrangement of recitations of an  
extended sadhana of Cittamani Tara
Yeshe, Lama Thubten, Cittamani Tara: A Commentary on the  
Anuttarayogatantra Method of Cittamani Tara
Zopa, Lama Thubten, Offering Prayer of the Four Mandalas to Cittamani  
Tara
T?ranath?, Jo-nan, The Origin of the Tara Tantra
If there is time, read:
Maitra, A. K., T?r? Tantram. Varendra Research Society, 1914 (Might be  
a bit hard to find)
Ghosh, Mallar. Development of Buddhist Iconography in Eastern India:   
A Study of Tara Prajnas of Five Tathgatas art Bhrikuti
Shastri, H., The Origin and Cult of Tara
