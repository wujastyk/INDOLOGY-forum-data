I am not informed well enough to answer your particular question. However, it may be helpful to you to know that a detail *partially* similar to the one you mention is found in: Jambhala-datta's Version of the Vetaala-pa;nca-vi.m;sati, ed and tr by M.B. Emeneau, New Haven, Connecticut: American Oriental Society, 1934, A.O.Series vol. 4, p. 26: aparo braahma.nas tasyaa;s citaa-bhasmani g.rha.m k.rtvaa tatraiva parih.rta-sukhas tasthau.
