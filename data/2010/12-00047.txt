Subject: Severe Hindi austerities in Kali Yuga?

I would add that the list of dharmas associated with the yugas in 
Manusmr?ti 1.85-86 also appears in the Mah?bh?rata (12.224.26-27, in the 
critical edition). The main point of these assignations seems to be to 
place yaj?a (Vedic sacrifice) in a bygone yuga, therefore justifying its 
loss of importance and allowing for other practices to be proclaimed as 
superior.

Different traditions would then claim that their practices are foremost 
in the Kali Yuga. Although this is especially true of bhakti traditions 
  -as seen in Bengali Vai??avism's assertion that chanting the name of 
Kr???a is the only way to attain liberation in Kali- others also used 
this procedure.

Thus, claiming that tapas (austerity) does not belong in Kali can be a 
way of belittling it in favor of another practice, such as bhakti. This, 
however, is not the case in the R?m?ya?a passage, as explained by Bob 
Goldman, where the var?as are the main concern.
