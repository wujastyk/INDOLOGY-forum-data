There are also substantial discussions of clouds in works of K??i??stra see Wojtilla, Gyula, 2006 ?History of Kr?s?i??stra, a History of Indian Literature on Traditional Agriculture.? One such work I recently had the fortune to read that has abundant discussions of seasonal rainfall and prognostication was the K??ikarmavivecana. It seemed quite closely related to the little studied genre of ?Tantric meteorology? such as can be found in the Bhairav?yamegham?l?, that it might even be best identified as a separate genre: Tantric agriculture (?). I remember seeing an MS of this in the Wellcome Institute in London but cannot now find my photocopies of it.
