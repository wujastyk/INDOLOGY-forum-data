Patrick,
especially Kathasaritsagara is important, but also Buddhist narratives (Jataka, Divyavadana) are interesting in this respect and some Jaina texts, too, I think.

I think there is some material in the Katha literature -- Pancatantra, Kathasaritsagara, Hitopadesa etc. She also wants to know whether there is any secondary literature dealing with this aspect of the Katha literature. Any help would be deeply appreciated. Thanks.
