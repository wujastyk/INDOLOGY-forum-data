I also agree with George about this. I have found publishers pretty 
amenable about diacritics. However in case of argument it is 
certainly worth making the point about treating Sanskrit with the 
same respect as French or German. There is also the fact that 
omitting diacritics can cause confusion between different words (cp. 
the kali/kAlI point).

It's not a great problem to write a pronunciation guide, and I don't 
think anyone minds if you recycle one you've done before, especially 
if you replace the examples with ones relevant to the current work.
