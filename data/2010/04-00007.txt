Extracts from my note in FLS News: Newsletter of the Folklore Society  
23, June 1996, p. 6 [in response to W.M.S. Russell, ?How many  
elephants??, FLS News 21, June 1995, p. 7] --

"The number four is in fact the standard one for this grouping of  
mythical elephants ... .  They are guardians of the compass points,  
and so either four or sometimes eight in number. ...  E.W. Hopkins is  
fully justified in asserting in relation to the epic material: "There  
is no myth of a world-upholding elephant" (Epic Mythology, Strassburg,  
Tr?bner, 1915, p. 17).  ...
    The most widespread Hindu cosmography is based on the myth of the  
churning of the ocean, found in the Br?hma?as (e.g. ?atapatha Br?hma?a  
3.2.4.1-6), the epics (e.g. Mah?bh?rata 1.15-17) and the Pur??as (e.g.  
Matsya Pur??a 249-251).  Here there is no mention of elephants, but Mt  
Meru is used as a churning stick or paddle to churn the ocean, and  
Vishnu takes the form of a tortoise (k?rma) on which Mt Meru is set,  
while the king of the snakes is used as the rope by which gods and  
Asura rotate the mountain.  At some stage the system of the four  
elephants of the quarters seems to have been conflated with this ...  
possibly in the Svayambh? Pur??? (a late Nepalese Pur??a); certainly  
it is not found in any of the major Pur??as."
