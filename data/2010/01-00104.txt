We have been sent 3 copies of this book, which has already been acquired by the Nepal representative for the Cooperative Acquisitions Program.  If anyone at a US institution wants a copy or an extra copy for their library, please have the librarian contact me.  If your library participates in the CAP a copy has presumably already been ordered for it.   According to the covering letter it centers on the struggle for human rights in Pokhara.
