FW: [INDOLOGY] order of letters
Dear Colleagues,
Even the great Panini did not include the sounds (anusv?ra, visarga, jihv?m?l?ya, upadhm?n?ya and the so-called yamas) in his ?ivas?tras.  They are called ayogav?ha sounds.  The tradition incorporates them in two places in the ?ivas?tras (so that they can be included in the two separate praty?h?ras: a? and ?al).  The jihv?m?l?ya and upadhm?n?ya are lost in most common writing forms, and are expressly lost in some Vedic schools like the M?dhyandina Yajurveda.  The two surviving sounds, the anusv?ra and visarga are conventionally accommodated at the end of vowels and represented as a? and a?.   This lack of a fixed location for these sounds has created a free-for-all pattern in modern dictionaries.

This would seem to be an important issue for electronic dictionaries -
in connection sorting and searching.
