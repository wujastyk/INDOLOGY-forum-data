I suspected that might be your response!  Sure.  I need this data for 
my own purposes, so I'll be happy to do it and re-distribute it.  It 
would be good to pass it on to GRETIL as well, although it would be 
nice to determine which source they used for the Sanskrit (Patna 
1967, Varanasi 1970, their own Skt. mss., etc.) to properly document 
the file.  If anyone can locate that information on the site, please 
pass that on.

There is a complete English translation done from the Sanskrit (with 
critical notes referencing the Tibetan) done by Geshe Lobsang 
Tharchin and Geshe Jampal Thardo with Art Engle and Robert Clark 
under the auspices of the American Institute of Buddhist Studies back 
in the 1970s/80s.  It is only now being edited for publication and 
should come out in the next couple of years as part of the ongoing 
Tengyur Translation Project at Columbia University.
