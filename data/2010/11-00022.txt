Subject: SARIT web application - Errors and Error Reporting
Message-ID: <161227090718.23782.6898602672672702977.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear Readers,

I have just been trying to use the SARIT web application for the first
time since the move from the States to Austria. Unfortunately, the web
interface seems to have been broken. While this is sometimes minor
there is at least one instance where things are somewhat more
serious. I find that one can no longer conveniently search for
material using simple ASCII character codes. Does anyone know who is
currently maintaining the site? I would like to be able to send
through a list of issues that seem to have arisen subsequent to the
site `upgrade'.


Best regards,

 Richard
