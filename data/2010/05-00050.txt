Subject: ADMIN: Change in the "reply" function of INDOLOGY
In-Reply-To: <AANLkTinVXraNueSRasKPLfkAhznS-DSl4Iv_8yc8dlK1@mail.gmail.com>
Message-ID: <161227089569.23782.9752545948662693233.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

This seems like a good option. Folks can hit "reply all" to send to the
whole list, still only one stroke, and just hit "reply" if they want the
reply to go to only the sender.
All best,
Loriliai
