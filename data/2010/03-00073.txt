Dear List Members,
Can anyone help finding a reference in Paninian literature for the
lengthening of the final vowel of trivali to trivalI in compounds?
MW says "f. in comp. the 3 folds over a woman's navel (regarded as a beauty)
VarB?S. lxx , 5 ?itus. GarP."
I have looked in P. 6.3.114-139, which appears to be the relevant section,
but may have missed something.
With thanks,
Oliver
