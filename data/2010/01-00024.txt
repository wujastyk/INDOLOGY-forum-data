Well, mzybe not so cool: Sanskrit script?
In response to the particular detail of Prof. Bhattacharya's reference
to Mahe"svaraananda's Mahaarthama~njarii, I argued in my (unpublished)
PhD dissertation that the lost archetype for all of the Sarada and
Kashmirian Nagari MSS of the text was written in Grantha or perhaps in
the Aryalipi of Kerala.  Despite the fact that the numerical majority
of the manuscripts of the text are from Kashmir, the work was composed
in the South, and the northern (i.e. Kashmirian) recension is an
inferior and heavily edited version of the text.
I would be happy to provide details of my argument to anyone who might
be interested,
Best,
Whitney
