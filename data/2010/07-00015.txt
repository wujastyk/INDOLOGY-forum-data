Abstract:
The article examines how the etymological composition of the Sanskrit
lexicon is influenced by time and whether this composition can be used
to date Sanskrit texts automatically. For this purpose, statistical
tests are applied to a corpus of lexically analyzed texts. Results
reported in the article may contribute to the diachronic lexicography
of Sanskrit and help to develop computational methods for analyzing
anonymous and undated Sanskrit texts.
