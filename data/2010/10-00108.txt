SUMMARY

This volume discusses the Bhaik?uk? manuscript of the Candr?la?k?ra 
(?Ornament of the Moon?), a commentarial treatise of the twelfth century 
based on the C?ndravy?kara?a (fifth century), Candragomin?s seminal 
Buddhist grammar of Sanskrit. The book offers an overview of the discovery 
of the Bhaik?uk? script, along with a description of all available written 
sources. The detailed study of the fragmentary codex unicus of the 
Candr?la?k?ra  is accompanied by a facsimile edition and extensive tables of 
the Bhaik?uk? script. The Buddhist author of the commentary has been 
identified for the first time, and the nature of his treatise and its position in 
the C?ndra school of grammar have been expounded. The history of the 
manuscript and newly discovered traces of the Bhaik?uk? script in Tibet have 
also been discussed. This publication will serve as a prolegomenon for the 
preparation of a critical edition of the Candr?la?k?ra, which until now was 
believed to have been lost irretrievably.

The Bhaik?uk? Manuscript of the Candr?la?k?ra will appeal to specialists with 
interests in a variety of fields such as Indian palaeography, grammar, 
Buddhism, history, and Indo-Tibetan studies.
