envy you.  From ground-zero you have built up a very strong position in 
Buddhist studies in this country. This is all to your credit and to your 
credit alone.
With the Vici grant, I am sure, your situation within the faculty has 
been strengthened greatly (certainly vis-a-vis Japanese and Chinese 
studies, I would think),
and thanks to you (and the coming of Bisschop),  religious studies in 
Leiden is outflanking my own department here. As to the latter, it has 
proved
in the last 20 years that it is impossible to detach it form the 
Judo-Christian tradition. The still latently present spirit of the 
minister prevents a free cosmopolitan view, in which other religions are 
not (silently) judged inferior. Sometimes I have the feeling that I have 
cycled all my life against the wind. All the same, I do not envy you.
It is an enormous challenge that lies ahead of you. I have only one PhD 
and one post-doc at the moment, but they already give me headaches.
But I am convinced that you will cope with it. Therefore I admire you.

Yours, as ever,
Hans
