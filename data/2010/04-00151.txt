dear peter,

i don't know whether this is of importance for your query, but immediately  
the inscription at saluvanguppam came to my mind. it is an identical text  
inscribed on the northern and southern wall of a temple in northern and  
southern brahmi script respectively.
see:
Hultzsch, E.: "Inscriptions on the Cave-Temple at Saluvanguppam." EI  
10.1909-10: 12-14.

cheers
