Subject: Severe Hindi austerities in Kali Yuga?

The idea that different religious duties are appropriate in the  
different yugas is widely stated. Compare Manusm?ti 1. 85-86 where  
aceticism (tapas)  is prescribed for the K?ta Age, knowledge  
(j??na) for the Tret?, sacrifice (yaj?a) for the Dv?para and  
charity (d?na) for the K?ta.

Alf is right to note that N?rada delivers a discourse in the  
Uttarak???a (sarga 65 of the critical edition) on asceticism and  
the yugas. But the ??i's point is rather different. He focuses on  
which of the four var?as are authorized to perform tapas in which  
yugas. His ultimate point is that ??dras are not so authorized until  
the K?ta. (As, starting with the brahmans, one class is added to the  
list each yuga). Thus, as the scene is set in the Tret?, the ??dra  
?amb?ka, is violating dharma and thus merits punishment.
