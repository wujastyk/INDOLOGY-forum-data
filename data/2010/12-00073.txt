[RISA-L LIST] Date of usage of the word Bhaarata to denote              India
If I remember right, the Critical Edition of the Mah?bh?rata is dated between 400BC - 400CE. The date of the H?th?gumph? inscription of Kh?ravela falls within a narrower range, possibly 2nd half of 1st century BC. According to Jayaswal and Banerji, Kh?ravela has used Bharadavasa (Skt. Bh?ratavar?a) to refer to the plains of north India. (See EI, vol. 20, p. 78)
