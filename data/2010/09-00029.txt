Malayalam text Jyotsnika sought
Dear scholars,
Might someone have a digital copy of the Malayalam text on vi?avaidya called Jyotsnik? they would be willing to share off-list?  It is quite rare and I am unable to get it by interlibrary loan or online.  If someone on the list has a paper copy of an edition, or even a manuscript, I would be happy to pay for a reproduction of it. 
Thank you,
