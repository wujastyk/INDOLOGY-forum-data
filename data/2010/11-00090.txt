to be organized on September 20th- 23rd 2011 in Bucharest, Romania.
Suggested topics include:
?      The formation of the Vedic canon: from family books to Vedic  
??kh?s, from Traividya to Caturveda;
?      Vedic schools and Vedic ?dialects?: ??kh?s and  
pr?ti??khyas;
?      The relation between ??kh?s and cara?as of the same or  
different Vedas (Rg, S?ma, Yajur, Atharva): borrowing, citation,  
supplementation, usurpation (YV hautra);
?      Vedic ??kh?s and cara?as in the performance of Vedic  
ritual: compatibility, incompatibility, competition and cooperation;
?      Sources for the localization and history of the ??kh?s and  
their promoters (inscriptions, manuscript colophons, literary  
sources, etc.);
?      Self-reflexivity of the Vedic tradition and its ??kh?s:  
anukrama??s, the (Yajur) vedavrk?a;

and paddhatis.
