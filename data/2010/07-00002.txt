RE: [INDOLOGY] The Kern Library
To all who have made use of the Kern Institute Library.
Unfortunately this is true. ?As a former librarian of the Kern Institute I
consider this the end of a unique collection. Although we will be given a
separate section in the University Library with open stacks, the
manuscripts, photo collections and antiquaria will be less accessible.
The association Kern Institute still exists and still has a private
collection. ?We hope to find a suitable place to display our treasures and
welcome international scholars as in the past.
