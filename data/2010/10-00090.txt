Dear Patrick,

There's lots scattered around Buddhist sources, very often
in Jaataka-s, Avadaana-s, and Mahaayaana suutras such as the 
Ga.n.davyuuha, where traders figure prominently. 

As I recall, Geiger's Culture of Ceylon in Mediaeval Times
has useful references to the Pali sources on this. I don't know of anything off hand that puts together the Buddhist
Sanskrit references to material culture very effectively
(does someone want to encourage a great project for
a dissertation?)

And of course the two great Tamil novels also have
much to say of merchants and trade. 

best,
Matthew
