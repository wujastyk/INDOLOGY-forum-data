A brief note on the history of the derivation of the name  
Vaaraa.nasii. While the name of the town is indeed commonly connected  
to the two rivers Vara.naa and Asi, earlier sources (in particular  
the original Skandapuraa.na) rather connect it to the name of the  
river Varaa.nasii (nowadays known as Vara.naa).

See Skandapuraa.na Vol. IIA (The Vaaraa.nasii Cycle), edited by Hans  
Bakker and Harunaga Isaacson, Groningen 2004, p. 222.
