Kittel?s transliteration gives v?ran?si but the Kanna? word is written ??????? that is v?r??asi. Could the given transliteration be a printing error?
To the wrong pronunciations add Himalaya for Him?laya and Panini for P??ini. But It is no use counting them, they are a legion. 
Best for all

As a post-scriptum to my first remark,
I want to addd that I have just had a look at Kittel's Kannada-English dictionary

it contains on page 1392
an entry "v?ra??si"
and the authority given is "Bp. 54, 65; 58, 34; My."

The list abbreviations gives

Bp. = "Basava pur??a. Bibliotheca Carn?taka, Mangalore, 1850"

If as early as the 6th century, which is a date often given for the Tamil /Ma?im?kalai /, we find the spelling v?ra??ci,
and if that spelling has remained the norm in Tamil
[See: <http://ta.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E0%AE%B5%E0%AE%BE%E0%AE%B0%E0%AE%A3%E0%AE%BE%E0%AE%9A%E0%AE%BF>]
there must be a reason.

It would be interesting to have additional data for other indian languages

>> I am tempted to add, in the section on mispronunciations, an entry on "vaaraaNasii" (as the name of the city), with a note to the effect that, for the same reasons as given for "mahaabhaarata" and "raamaayaNa," the third syllable in this name is the least appropriate place to apply a stress accent.? But I have been struck over the years by the frequency with which many people I respect as experts on Banaras habitually lengthen and stress the vowel in the third syllable---so much so that I wonder whether they might be following some local tradition unknown to me, despite the official spelling of the name.? Are they?? Is there any good reason to make the third "a" vowel in "Varanasi" long?
