Southern pronunciations ? (Re: INDOLOGY FAQ
15 02 10
Kittel?s transliteration gives v?ran?si but the Kanna? word is written ??????? that is v?r??asi. Could the given transliteration be a printing error?
To the wrong pronunciations add Himalaya for Him?laya and Panini for P??ini. But It is no use counting them, they are a legion. 
Best for all

Southern pronunciations ? (Re: INDOLOGY FAQ
As a post-scriptum to my first remark,
I want to addd that I have just had a look at Kittel's Kannada-English dictionary
it contains on page 1392
an entry "v?ra??si"
and the authority given is "Bp. 54, 65; 58, 34; My."
The list abbreviations gives
Bp. = "Basava pur??a. Bibliotheca Carn?taka, Mangalore, 1850"
If as early as the 6th century, which is a date often given for the Tamil /Ma?im?kalai /, we find the spelling v?ra??ci,
and if that spelling has remained the norm in Tamil
[See: <http://ta.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E0%AE%B5%E0%AE%BE%E0%AE%B0%E0%AE%A3%E0%AE%BE%E0%AE%9A%E0%AE%BF>]
there must be a reason.
It would be interesting to have additional data for other indian languages
