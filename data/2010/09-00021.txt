Akam 113
Dear Indologists,
In the Classical Tamil poem Akan????u (Akam) 113, consider the following line.
 e??ap p??a? nal n???u umpar (Akam. 113.17)
The word 'e??a' has been interpreted by the commentators variously as meaning 'not attacking those fleeing the battle' or 'not fleeing from the battle'. I think what we seem to have here is a negative adjectival participial form of the causative 'e?u' 'to make music, to play the lute', offering a simple and direct meaning of 'not making music'. The poet is cleverly using the same device we find in v???p p?rpp?? (Akam.24.1) where v??? 'non-sacrificing' is used in a similar fashion. Thus P??a?, the king or chieftain, is a p??a? who does not make music. Thus the poet signifies the dynastic name which later came to be called 'b??a'. We also find such usages involving homonyms such as porunar (por?ap porunar 'non-fighting porunar') in Classical tamil texts. 
If this is correct, then what we have here is an indication that the earlier form of the dynastic name 'b??a' was most probably 'p??a?'. Such voicing of initial voiceless consonants could have arisen as in DEDR 4124 Ta. p??ai Te. b??a or as a result of re-interpretation of the word 'p??a-' found in the compound Perump??a- (as in Perump??app??i, the region lying across the Tamil-Telugu border land) the Sanskrit equivalent of which would be B?hadb??a which is found in the T?lagunda pillar inscription of 5th century CE (EI 8, p.32). The voiced pronunciation of 'p' as 'b' after the nasal 'm' could have given rise to such interpretation. (There does not seem to be a Telugu cognate of DEDR 4068 Ta. p??a?). 
The B??a dynasty later claimed an origin from the puranic asura Mah?bali through his son B??a. This connection is also indicated in the Ma?im?kalai 19.54. (Does any other Indian dynasty claim descent from Bali?)
