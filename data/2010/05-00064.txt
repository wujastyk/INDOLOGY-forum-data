Help with keyboard
I avoid Windows in all its varieties as much as possible and know nothing about Windows7; but rather than using Keyman, you might consider using Dr. Smith's keyboard layout (at http://bombay.indology.info/software/fonts/induni/index.html), or the Europatastatur (http://www.europatastatur.de/), which makes typing just about any Latin-based Unicode character easy.
