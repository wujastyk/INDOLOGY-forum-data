Subject: trivalI in compounds

Thank you Victor,

That is interesting, and would be more so if the occurrence I have were a
proper name, but it is not what I'm looking for.

I found it in the ZRGgAra-zataka of BhartRhari v.78, where its usage is
unexceptional.

I would simply like to know why the final vowel lengthens if trivali is in a
compound.
