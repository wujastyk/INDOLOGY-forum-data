A.B. Keith article in JRAS 1907
Dear List, 
My access to JSTOR currently? isn't working.? I would like to download an article by Keith which appears to deal with the development of Vedic Shakhas.? I am interested in particular in the development of the Mandukeyas, for a festschrift paper that I am trying to write, with a deadline hanging over my head. 
Does anyone have a pdf of this article, or can anyone easily & readily get it [without much trouble!]?? I would of course be most grateful for your help. 
And if anyone else has any insights into the obscure origins of the Mandukeyas, I would like to hear about them. 
Best wishes to all, 
George Thompson
