I have personal experience of living and thinking in a duodecimal system,
since I grew up largely in Sterling currency areas before decimalization,
when there were 12 pence in a shilling and 240 pence in a pound, and so on.
Most of my early school maths examples were about ?sd., i.e., pounds,
shillings, and pence, and hence duodecimal maths (expressed in decimal base
counting :-( ).  Having a shilling (which was actually worth quite a lot)
that you could divide in whole-number halves, quarters or thirds was a great
daily convenience.   So were the lush possibilities offered by 240 pence.  A
glance at this table<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimalisation#.C2.A3sd_conversion>shows
how much more convenient the 12 base was, especially for
small-denomination coins.
