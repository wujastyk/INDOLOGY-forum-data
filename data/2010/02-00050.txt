Oops, I am sorry, I mean awesome!

-- amba kulkarni

P.S. By the way, I have come across usage of 'awful' in the sense of amazing
as 'She is awful pretty (cobuild dictionary), which resembles the use of the
word bhaya.mkara in Marathi as an adjective of 'su.mdara'.
May be that might be the cause of confusion.
