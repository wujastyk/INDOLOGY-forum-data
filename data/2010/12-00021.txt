I don't know a single one-stop solution, but can only give some scattered references in non-philosophical literature. In the beginning of the 15 chapter, the Artha??stra lists 32 tantrayuktis as "devices of scientific treatment" and gives short explanations of them. Without vi?aya and sa?gati, all other terms appear here verbatim, too. 

In Les sources du droit dans le syst?me traditionnel de l'Inde, Robert Lingat compares the Mimamsa adhikaranas to juridical procedures, see the Engl. translation, p. 149 seqq. (The classical law of India / Robert Lingat ; transl. from the French with additions by J. Duncan M. Derrett. - Berkeley  [et al.] : University of California Press, 1973)

hope it helps
