In my recent posting on 37 I was subject to
an error of memory (thanks to Jonathan Silk for
discretely pointing it out to me). The group
of Buddhas of contrition according to the
Triskandhakasuutra numbers 35, not 37, and it 
was this that Wayman sought to explain.

37 is nevertheless numerologically important
in Buddhism: it is the number of the
bodhipak.sadharma-s, the "factors allied with
awakening."
