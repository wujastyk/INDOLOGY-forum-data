The present work is devoted to Bhairava, a fierce form of the Hindu god Siva, and focusses on the ways in which he is represented in South Indian sculpture from the 8th to the 13th century AD. This complex and ubiquitous figure, transgressive and yet at the same time a source of salvation, was accorded an exceptional importance in the religion and art of medieval India. This study brings to the fore his so far underestimated popularity in South India. Bhairava?s exceptionally rich and varied iconography has been examined in the light of both mythological literature (mainly the Pur??as) and normative treatises (?ilpa??stra, ?gama/tantra, collections of dhy?na?lokas, etc.). In the course of the book, the author attempts to unveil what this deity meant for those who sculpted, contemplated and worshipped his carved representations.
Keywords: Bhairava, K?etrap?la, Siva, iconography, South India
