The confusion is partly caused by the transfer of connotation from spoken things to written things.
Vir?ma pertains to speech, a position is still valid for Sanskrit. The da?da is a written sign indicating where the vir?ma will occur; in modern usage vir?ma primarily means the written sign. But I have seen also the use of the compound vir?macihna.
Halanta means a consonant ending unit. The ? sign, say in ?????, indicates that the final sound is lone and not a syllable as in ????- . In Hindi halant may mean this sign. As far as my knowledge goes "p?r?a-vir?ma" and "ardha-vir?ma" are later terms used for the Sanskrit vir?ma and yati in connection with writing.

Dear Colleagues,

Can someone make the distinction among the following terms clear with some more historical elucidations in the context of Sanskrit language? What has been the practice as far as Sanskrit (and not Hindi) is concerned and how it it different from Hindi construction? Is "vir?ma" also used in Hindi language as synonymous to "da??a" ? And as far as Sanskrit language is concerned if "vir?ma" or "da??a" (?) is synonymous to "halanta" then why do we use "da??a" after putting the "halanta" to the last consonant of the word in a sentence? I think I am in a real confusion. I would really appreciate if someone could make a distinction amongst the following terms;

"da??a", "halanta", "vir?ma", "p?r?a-vir?ma" and "ardha-vir?ma" 


Thank you very much in advance.

Yours sincerely,

Mrinal Kaul
