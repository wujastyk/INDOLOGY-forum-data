Fwd: stone-inscriptions from Sichuan
The same kind of inscriptions are found in the province to the south  
of Sichuan, in Yunnan, more precisely in Dali.
Preserved in the Dali Museum (and many more in the Kunming Museum).
These are  the same style of Buddhist inscriptions, in early Nagari,  
with calendar animals: Tiger/Dragon, etc.
Dali (Nanchao) was a Buddhist kingdom until the Mongols did them in  
in 1253. Still, 3 major pagodas (9th c. and later) remain.
I took some video files of the inscriptions at Dali last summer  
(unfortunately no still photos, as my camera did not work); they are  
several/many  MB long. I will try to attach/upload a small size  one  
(704 KB). The one with animals is 26 MB!
The same kind of script is used elsewhere, for example at Feilai  
Peak, Hangzhou, 11th c., of which I have a large size rubbing.
Cheers,
