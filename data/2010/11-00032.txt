I've checked the Youtube link there, and it works fine.

Dear Friends

We are pleased to invite you to view our new documentary 'Mountain God and
Sacred Text'. This 35min documentary is now available online in three parts
at:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC0Uw_lnhYg
*
About the film:
*We set out to document a seven-day festival that was held in the hamlet of
Naluna in the Garhwal Himalaya, India, in November 2009. The festival
centred on the sacred text of the Bhagavatapurana which tells the story of
the beloved Indian deity, Krishna. The festival was conducted under the
auspices of the local village deity Kandar. Our film captures the sights and
sounds of this beautiful mountain community, as well as the fascinating
interaction between the story-telling tradition from the North Indian plain,
and Kandar, the village god.

My cameraman and editor Julian Dennis and I have worked long and hard on
this film, and we look forward to reading your feedback on Youtube.

Please circulate this message as widely as possible.

With thanks in advance

McComas
