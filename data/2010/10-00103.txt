Purana/All-India Kashiraj Trust
The last bound vol. in our OPAC is 2005.  I have asked the office in New Delhi to tell me if there are more recent issues accumulating for binding, and if we have not been getting it, to enquire why.

The last issue in our library is: Vol. 49, Nos. 1-2 [combined], 2007. 
The only contact address I see is that of the main editor, R. K. Sharma (i.e. R?mkara? ?arm?) printed on the back of the cover.
Hope it helps
