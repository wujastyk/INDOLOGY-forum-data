Turtles (and elephants) all the way down?
Continuing with references to the earth being supporting by a single  
tortoise:  In the bhuvanakoza section (verse 31) of the  
SiddhAntasundara (ca. 1500 CE), JJAnarAja presents the following  
argument for the earth having support:
   dhRtavaktrasarIsRpo 'pi gRdhraH
   praharaM tiSThati khe 'lpavIrya evam /
   gagane na kathaM sa kUrmarUpaH
   pratikalpaM dhRtabhUr acintyazaktiH //
"A vulture, which has only little strength, rests in the sky holding a  
snake in its beak for a prahara.  Why can [the deity] in the form of a  
tortoise, who possesses an inconceivable potency, not hold the Earth  
in the sky for a kalpa?"
More references to the earth resting on a tortoise is found in verses  
63 and 78 of the same section.
Best,
Toke
