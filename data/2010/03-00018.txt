The Sivapadas of Ancient Cambodia
Dear List,
I am interested to know if there are any plans to publish the proceedings from this conference from 2008 by the European Association of Southeast Asian Archaeologists:
The Sivapadas of Cambodia I-III
http://www.iias.nl/euraseaa12/?q=the-sivapadas-of-ancient-cambodia-ihttp://www.iias.nl/euraseaa12/?q=the-sivapadas-of-ancient-cambodia-iihttp://www.iias.nl/euraseaa12/?q=the-sivapadas-of-ancient-cambodia-iii
Or have any of the individual papers been published separately? Perhaps there are some list members who presented at the conference who might wish to comment on or off-list?
Thanks much for your assistance.
Best Wishes,
Benjamin
