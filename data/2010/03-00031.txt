"Saisha" as the name of a goddess?
The only exactly parallel case (in terms of structure and the justification
given) of which I am aware was contained in a story/joke I once heard from
Pt. V. B. Bhagavat/Bhagwat: someone named/naming his son apy-ekadanta,
thinking it was one of Gane;sa's name, on the basis of the Amara-ko;sa
(1.94) line: apyekadanta-heramba-lambodara-gajaananaa.h.
The onus of proving that sai.saa is a name of Lak.smii should be on the one
who made the claim. If the proof is said to be in the line >sai?? dev?
sakala-bhuvana-pr?rthan?-k?madhenu?<, even after you explained that sai.saa
is just saa e.saa, then sai.saa should also be another name/word for
vakrokti, because Bhaamaha wrote: sai.saa sarvatra vakrokti.h!
