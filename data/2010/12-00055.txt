Is anybody aware of any discussion in the primary or secondary literature as to the way the term deyadharma was traditionally analyzed/understood? How does this compound get to have the pragmatic meaning of 'meritorious gift'? How has the tradition itself understood the value of dharma in this compound? I have seen Edgerton's gloss in BHSD, something like 'having the nature of something to be given' (quoted from memory), but I wonder if this corresponds to traditional interpretations, and whether the element deya might not simply have meant 'gift' in this context (rather than 'something to be given').
Thank you,
