Buddhist Tales
Dear Indology,
Could someone kindly tell me if there is an anthology of Mahayana  
tales of the Bodhisattvas, analogous to the Hindu puranas and the  
narratives of the gods and goddesses? Not Jatakas, but, for example,  
stories of the deeds of Manjusri, Maitreya or Avalokitesvara...?
Many thanks for your help,
Mary
