Subject: Raining Blood: rudhiravar=?utf-8?Q?=E1=B9=A3a?=
Message-ID: <161227090811.23782.14845792315104741250.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

The specific text Prof. Vasudeva mentioned, the Kr??ikarmavivecana, is  
also known as Kr??ipaddhati, Kr??isa?graha, and the Kr??ipar??ara?. It  
is under the last of these names that a critical edition was published  
in 1960 by Girija Prasanna Majumdar and Sures Chandra Bannerji,  
through the Asiatic Society's Bibliotheca Indica (Work 285). I have a  
mostly un-proofed unicode transliteration that I'd be happy to share,  
although a preliminary search for specifically red rains came up dry.

There are also substantial discussions of clouds in works of  
K??i??stra see Wojtilla, Gyula, 2006 ?History of Kr?s?i??stra, a  
History of Indian Literature on Traditional Agriculture.? One such  
work I recently had the fortune to read that has abundant discussions  
of seasonal rainfall and prognostication was the K??ikarmavivecana. It  
seemed quite closely related to the little studied genre of ?Tantric  
meteorology? such as can be found in the Bhairav?yamegham?l?, that it  
might even be best identified as a separate genre: Tantric agriculture  
(?). I remember seeing an MS of this in the Wellcome Institute in  
London but cannot now find my photocopies of it.

Best,

Somadeva Vasudeva
