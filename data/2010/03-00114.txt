Anyone heard of a flower called "aniccam?"
aru?p?nam is a healing herbal in the Atharvaveda, probably a mountain plant likely to be growing in the Lesser Himalayas. But the Orissa manuscripts read arusy?nam.

Apparently another name of the a?iccam is aruppalam, which looks as if it could be have a Prakrit or Sanskrit origin (arpala, rupala?) but I can't find anything in those languages.? G. Hart
