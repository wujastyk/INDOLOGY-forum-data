Crow lore & Luciano Petech
Dear List,
I am very grateful to all and sundry who have sent me illuminating pieces of
information (and off list even materials) on crows in Indian (and Tibetan)
cultures.
A bit unrelated to the above topic is a wish of my friend, who is not a
member of the list, to get in touch with the eminent Italian (and world)
Tibetologist Luciano Petech (b. 1914). Could anybody inform me/us about him?
With best regards
Jan Filipsky
