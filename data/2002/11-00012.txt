References to China in Sanskrit lit
But what about Kautilya Arthashastra (I AD):
02.11.114 ciinapaTTaaZca ciinabhuumijaa ?
China, in my mind, must be known in India 100-200 years before

PO> I have had to deal with this in connection to the date of Manu. I
PO> append some comments of mine in my intro to Manu.
PO> The reference to the Chinese with the work c?na is problematic. The
PO> term is not used by Pata?jali or the Dharmas?tras. The word was
PO> probably derived from a central Asian language and is related to the
PO> Qin (Chin) dynasty (221-206 B.C.E.), which, although short lived, was
PO> the first to unify China. The term itself, however, may have been
PO> older, because the Qin was a state in Northwest China prior to that
PO> time with strong trade connection with Central Asia. The term
PO> ?China?, like ?India? itself, is not a term of self-identification by
PO> the Chinese. The term came back to China probably from India via
PO> Buddhist monks and texts.  When a people known as c?na came to be
PO> known in India is difficult to estimate. The term?s absence in the
PO> earlier literature, however, makes it likely that it could not have
PO> been know before the 1st century B.C.E. It was during this time or a
PO> little earlier under the Han dynasty that Chinese trade with the west
PO> began to flourish.
PO> We do have, however, the mention of ?aka in the compound ?akayavana
PO> by Pata?jali (on P??ini 2.4.10). So, the word yavana must have been
PO> in circulation by the middle of the 2nd century B.C.E. Interestingly,
PO> we have the progression from yavana in P??ini, to yavana and ?aka in
PO> Pata?jali, to yavana, ?aka, and c?na in the MDh and the Mah?bh?rata.
PO> I doubt whether the term ciina could have come to India until the
PO> expansion of foreign trade under the Han dynasty. An upper limit of
PO> 1st cent BCE appears to me reasonable, unless there is strong
PO> evidence to the contrary.
