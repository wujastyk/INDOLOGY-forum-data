Dear Colleagues,

1)  Can anyone tell me the date of birth (year is sufficient) of Professor
V. Venkatachalam, who died earlier this year?  He was a former VC of
Sampurnanand and Kameshwar Singh Sanskrit Universities and President of the
Indian Council for Philosophical Research.

2)  Does anyone have an up-to-date e-mail address for Thomas Oberlies?  I
have only his Freiburg one, which is no longer operational.

With thanks

John Brockington
