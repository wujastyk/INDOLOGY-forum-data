Over the last decade, many humanities scholars have been persuaded by
the promise and the power of encoding schemes for electronic texts to
create texts, sometimes very large and complex, encoded using these
schemes. This is specially true of SGML/XML based encodings, with the
implementation of the Text Encoding Initiative being particularly
influential in the community. However, scholars who have made such texts
have typically discovered that software to publish them is too expensive
for their limited budgets, or too difficult to use, or lacking essential
facilities, or all three of these.
In this talk I will present and discuss Anastasia, an electronic
publishing software designed to address the need for an adequate,
affordable and user-friendly system. Anastasia has been developed in the
last five years in a partnership between the Centre for Technology and
the Arts, De Montfort University, and a new electronic publishing
company, Scholarly Digital Editions (SDE). Anastasia stands for
'Analytic system tools and SGML integration application'. As this
implies, it is able to handle all valid SGML and XML documents, with no
limits on their complexity.
