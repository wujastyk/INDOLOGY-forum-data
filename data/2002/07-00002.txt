Dear Indologists:

(The same with a correction:)

As I wrap up my edition of the Atharvaziras there are a couple verses
that I presume to be quoted from earlier works but that I have not
been
able to identify.  I would be grateful if any of you recognize them
from
elsewhere:

vaalaagramaatra.m h.rdayasya madhye vizva.m deva.m jaataveda.m
vare.nyam | (64ab in Adyar Library's edition; cd = Ka.thaU 5.13cd,
and with a variant, Ka.thaU 5.12cd and ZveU 6.12cd)

praa.ne.sv antar manaso li*ngam aahur yasmin krodho yaa ca t.r.s.naa
k.samaa ca |
t.r.s.n.aa.m chittvaa hetujaalasya muula.m buddhyaa sa.mcintya (or:
sa.mcita.m) sthaapayitvaa tu rudre |
rudra ekatvam aahu.h |   (66 in AL)

ak.saraat sa.mjaayate kaala.h kaalaad vyaapaka ucyate | (not in AL
ed.,
but in Naaraaya.na's reading, in adhyaaya 6).

Thanks for any clues.
Tim
