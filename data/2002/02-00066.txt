On the same line, in miniatures a lion is frequently represented as a
tiger with a mane, or even with what looks less like a mane than a
beard.  This pops up particular in representations of Vishnu Narasimha.
Has anyone worked on when this change starts?  And can it be correlated
with a decline in the population and spread of the Indian lion, so that
it was harder and harder to see one even in royal menageries?
