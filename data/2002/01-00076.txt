As in Sanskrit *tdha is phonetically impossible, I think the best way is to
consider the ligature graphically built up of t- and -dha as representing a
local variety of ddha, probably in a linguistic environment where the
opposition between sonants and surds is not particularly strong.

Yours,
Ferenc
