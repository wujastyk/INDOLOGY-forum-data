Subject: Northwestern U. - any listmembers?
Message-ID: <161227070642.23782.18079761100061097871.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I need to get a complete copy of one issue of a very small journal, J.
of the International School of Vedic and Allied Research, of which
Northwestern University Library has the only complete run.  Is there
anyone at Northwestern on the list who could help me with this?

Thanks,
Allen
