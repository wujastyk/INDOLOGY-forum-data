With the exception of several verses quoted in Haribhadra's
Abhisamayalankaraloka, the text exists only in Tibetan, as far as I
know. In addition to the two articles quoted by Richard Mahoney,
there is another by Skilling (exact reference not at hand, but
something like "Vasubandhu on Travel", published in a Thai journal
(in English)). There are also a number of studies in Japanese, mostly
on chapter 4. If you can read Japanese, please let me know and I will
try to collect the references.
