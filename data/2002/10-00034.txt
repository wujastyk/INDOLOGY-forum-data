As Dominik has pointed out, I am working on something else right
now, but hope to return to the hamsa in the not too distant future.

Those who are interested in my remarks the last time this topic
appeared on the list could check the archive for earlier this year.

And thank you to Joanna Kirkpatrick for her bibliographical
suggestion. I'd be delighted to receive any other snippets of
information in relation to both the hamsa and birds in Sanskrit
literature generally, either on or off the list.
