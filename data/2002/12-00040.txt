Subject: How notes were kept and books were made?
Message-ID: <161227071889.23782.473069210159949358.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Has anyone done anything on how people composed books in pre-modern
India, starting perhaps from how they kept notes (or whether)?  Has
anyone noted mss in the repositories that seemed to be of in-process
books rather than completed ones?
