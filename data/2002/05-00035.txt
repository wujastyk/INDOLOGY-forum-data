Buddhist Monastery at Sankaram near Anakapalle
I am looking for a good discussion of the images and inscriptions found at
Sankaram. I am particularly interested in the dates of the Buddha images
found there. I have read the ASI report from 1907-8 but I was hoping for a
more recent examination.
Thanks
