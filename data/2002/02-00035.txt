praa.na and sun
Dear friends,
Q: Which texts on yoga and tantra identify or
link the sun and praa.na?
Clarification:
1. It seems a quite widespready idea to link
these two in modern presentations of yoga and
meditation, see a few quotes under (6) randomly
selected from the internet (first two suitable
hits after search on "prana sun").
2. Several vedic texts identify, directly or
indirectly, praa.na and the sun, e.g. Ath.Veda
11.4.12, S'atapatha Braahma.na 10.4.1.23,
Aitareya Braahma.na 1.19 and 5.31.3, Ait.
Aara.nyaka 2.2.1, and Pras'na Up. 2.5ff. Most
massively, and most convincingly to common sense,
these texts present as the cosmic counterpart of
praa.na not the sun (suurya, aaditya, savit.r)
but the wind, vaayu.
3. Some of these late Vedic texts link praa.na
and knowledge/insight/consciousness (prajnaa)
(Kau.siitaki Up) -- the Brahma Suutra seem
S'ankara's commentary (2.4.15-16) are unwilling
to accept this.
4. The Yoga-vaasi.s.tha presents a much closer
link between praa.na and knowledge -- cf.
Dasgupta in his hist. of indian philosophy,
