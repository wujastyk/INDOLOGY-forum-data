Swans
Since the list does no accept images (Dominik told me a reason but  I
forgot why), I cannot supply you directly with the evidence,but early
depictions of Hamsa from the Mauryan period until quite late 12th
13th century are all obviously geese. the Mauryan offering platform
at the Vajrasana at Bodhgaya for example.Swans do appear in 20th
century calendar  prints of Sarasvati and the like but that is
probably European influence. In other examples from Nepal, the last
bastion of true Sanskrit Buddhism, Chandra's chariot is pulled by the
seven Hamsa which are definitely depicted as geese in  Buddhamargi
paintings and sculpture to the present day.
In short the physical evidence for the "Swan" is simmply not there.
