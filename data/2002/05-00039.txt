Brhatkathaashlokasamgraha
Dr. Andreas Bigger has completed a transliteration of Budhasvamin's
Brhatkathaashlokasamgraha and has agreed to make this text available on
our homepage ( http://www.indologie.unizh.ch ). I am happy to share this
news and I would like to thank Dr. Bigger for this contribution to the
thesaurus of electronic Sanskrit texts. Any feedback is of course
welcome.
