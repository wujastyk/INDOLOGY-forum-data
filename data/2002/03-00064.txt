I do not know where a picture of mu;nja grass can be found. However, the
references in literature indicate that the grass must have been in common
use for girdles of boys undergoing initiation and for making of  ropes,
mats, footwear, nooses  etc.  See An Illustrated Ardha-magadhi Dictionary,
vol. 4, pp. 181-82, in addition to Sm.rti literature in general under
mau;njii.
