an inquiry
A colleague of mine is doing some research on E. M, Forster, and is looking for information on a book he mentions in a December 1944 BBC broadcast:  a then recent translation, in India, of Kusti Prayers by Piloo Nanavutty, a member of the Parsi community in Bombay.  She checked WorldCat and the British Library catalogue, but couldn't find the Indian publishing details (city, publisher, date).  Can anyone recommend a good place to get this information?  Thanks.
