Subject: Voiced aspirate consonants and neighing (or other animal              cries)

Sanskrit grammarians do use animal sounds as analogies to speech
sounds.  Though it may have been an explanation provided by a modern
traditional teacher (I cannot find the references at present in a
quick glance through the commentaries), one explanation of the use of
the vowels 'u U 3u' under Pa 1.2.27 UkAlo 'jjhrasvadIrghaplutaH to
explain the three durations of vowels in Sanskrit is that it imitates
the crowing of the rooster.
Sincerely,
Peter Scharf
