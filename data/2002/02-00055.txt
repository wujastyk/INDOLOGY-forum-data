Dear Prof. Gombrich,

Thanks for the suggestion.  My colleague is going only to Sweden, I
find out, and I will give him Prof. Schalk's name.

Sincerely,

Allen Thrasher

Someone who is very much in touch with Tamils in Scandinavia is
Professor Peter Schalk, Professor of Religious Studies at the
University of Uppsala, Sweden.
