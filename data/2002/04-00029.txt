Dinakhaya-sam.kraanti
Dear List Members
I have come across a term Dinakhayasam.kraanti in a mid-sixteenth century
Nepalese inscription. As we know, there are 12 sam.kraanti-s in a year and
the word in question means the passage of the sun from one ra.shi to the
next. We also know that a sam.kraanti is prefixed either with the name of a
zodiac or of a month and this helps us in identifying a month according to
the solar reckoning.
