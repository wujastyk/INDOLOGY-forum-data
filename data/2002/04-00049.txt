My humble opinion:

- two volumes, text in one, translation in the other.

Or:

- text on one page, translation on the adjacent page (a nightmare in terms
of layouting unless you have omnipotent software!).

Having half the text/translation in one and the second half in the other is
inconvenient, as the reader would have to constantly go back and forth in
one and the same book. I suppose publishing text and translation in
separate volumes is the most convenient solution for the reader, and also
the most convenient solution in terms of doing the layout.
