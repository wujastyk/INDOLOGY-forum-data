Dear list-members,
the three Pali-versions of the HaMsajAtaka all mention Mt. cittakUTa. In the
MahAhaMsajAtaka, this mountain is said to be in the Himalayas. I wonder if
you have any information on a more precise location of this mountain. I
would particularly be interested in knowing whether it might be in the
vicinity of lake Manasarovar.

Sincerely,
