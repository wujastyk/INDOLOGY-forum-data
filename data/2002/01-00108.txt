Is Unicode welcome yet on the list?
Just another confirmation to the Unicode question. In my LinuX-system
the diacritics were displayed like expected (I am working within the rather
primitive e-mail system of Emacs (rmail) and just had to switch from
my CSX font to a UTF font).
Since I think that every move into the direction of Unicode is useful
I would be quite interested to know which system you were using and
how the diacritics were accessed from the keyboard, in other words
a "HOWTO" for the end user.
