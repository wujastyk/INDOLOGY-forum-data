Insects in Buddhism
In additions to J.Kirk's and Matthew Kapstein's
responses one could refer to LAMBERT
SCHMITHAUSEN, 1997 Maitri and Magic - Aspects of
the Buddhist Attitude Toward the Dangerous in
Nature, Publikationen zur Buddhismuskunde im
Verlag der Akademie, Vienna. It deals with the
Buddhist attitude -- basically maitrii -- to
dangerous and obnoxious animals (including but
not limited to insects).
