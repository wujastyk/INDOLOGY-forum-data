Rig Veda
You can find online versions of his books at www.voi.org which will forward
you to http://www.bharatvani.org/
The specific book you are looking for is at:
http://www.bharatvani.org/books/rig/
To my knowledge, Shrikant Talageri not a Dr. but a bank clerk.
It would also be useful to read Dr. Michael Witzel's review of Talageri's
book at:
http://www1.shore.net/~india/ejvs/ejvs0702/ejvs0702a.txt for the first of 3
parts in HTML format
or
http://www1.shore.net/~india/ejvs/ejvs0702/ejvs0702article.pdf
for the whole thing in PDF format.
Talageri wrote a response to Witzel although I don't have a reference for
it.
I think you will find it a rather, uh, interesting exchange.
