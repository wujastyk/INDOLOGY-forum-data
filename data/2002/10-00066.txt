Recent queries on INDOLOGY re: Devanagari OCR
Dear Dominik,
CDAC ( URL http://www.cdacindia.com/html/gist/products/chitra.asp ) has
announced the release of a devanagari OCR software package called CHITRANKAN
.  I would be very interested to know if any of the INDOLOGY list members
have tried this, particularily on older typeset devanagari books.
Thanks,
Harry Spier
