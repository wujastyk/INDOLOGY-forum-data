Which number the naada indicates?
I have had a quick look through the two most comprehensive lists of
chronogram words, namely:
    D.C. Sircar, Indian Epigraphy, pp. 230-3
    P.V. Kane, History of Dharmasastra, vol.V.1, pp.702-3.
I didn't find any listing for either naada or s'abda, so I think taking
naada as = svara = 7 is the safest. But please check these lists (and also
the one in Buhler's Indian Paleography) more carefully than I did before
reaching a final conclusion!
