Yamagita in Nepal
I don't know whether this helps, but the records of the Nepal German
Manuscript Preservation Project (NGMPP) contain a number of
manuscripts of the Yamagita. If you are interested, I could possibly
provide the accession numbers which should hide somewhere in my old
paper bundles.
best wishes
