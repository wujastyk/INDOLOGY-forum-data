Thanks for the tips, Michael.  I will have a closer look to see if parts
look Sino-Tibetan rather than Indo-Aryan.  I suppose the phrase
YamarAjA... could be taken over bodily from Nepali in Bhote.

It is in (older) Nepali:   yamarAjA-le AgyA garyA  "Yamaraja gave the
order..."  etc. etc.
You could ask Ted Riccardi to take a look at it.

Manang, Tibetan (South Tibetan dialect, "Bhote") speaking and high up
in
the Himalayas,  is a bit unsual for such a text, but of course not
impossible: the Manangis  are great traders, all the way to SE Asia,
and
have a "firman" (Lal Mohar) for that since about the time the MS is
supposed to have been written.
