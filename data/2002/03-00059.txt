I forwarded this message to Prof. S R Sarma of Aligarh who is
now at hand in Kyoto.  H sent me an answer as follows:

--------------------
Dear Prof. Yano,

The day is divided into 4 praharas and the night into 4 yaamas.  However,
the first and last half yaamas of the night are not taken into account
because there is light enough immediately after the sun and before sunrise
for people to engage in various activities.  Thus there remain three yaamas
when it is really dark.  And hence the night is called tri-yaamaa in
Sanskrit;  and various monastic orders perform rituals in these three
yaamas.

S. R. Sarma

I hope this answer helps.
