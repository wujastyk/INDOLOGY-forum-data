Buddhist verses
Your first citation seems to refer to parts of verse 5, 1st Kozasthaana of Vasubandhu's Abhidharmakoza:
        anaasravaa maargasatyam trividham caapy asamsk.rtam /
        aakaazam dvau nirodhau ca tatraakaazam anaav.rti.h //
My edition of the work does not have a verse index, but check this text for other passages as well.
