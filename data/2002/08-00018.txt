Chinese in India
Dear Friends:
Can anyone on the list shed light on when China has its first trade
or other contact with India -- or at least the northwestern regions
of the subcontinent? And when do you think that the term "Ciina" to
refer to the Chinese could have first arisen within Sanskrit?
Thanks.
Patrick
