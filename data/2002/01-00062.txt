The short answer to your query is that the Valmiki Ramayana does not
describe any meeting between Rama and Sita before (or indeed immediately
after) the breaking of the bow by which Rama wins her.  Indeed, Sita herself
really does not figure at all in this episode.  Thus Kampan's description is
probably the first record of this motif that was to become so popular in
subsequent versions of the Ramayana.
