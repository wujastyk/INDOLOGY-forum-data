Devanagari Software
Dear colleagues,
On behalf of a colleague who does not have access to this list I would
like to ask for advice regarding the following questions:
1) Is there any OpenSource OCR Software available for Sanskrit written
in Devanagari or transliteration ?
2) If yes, does this Software allow to add more Glyphes to meet
different fonts ?
3) Is there any OpenSource Editor for Sanskrit available which maps
Devanagari to Transliteration 1-1 and which exports to Word, especially
for the representation of conjuncts?
4) What kind of Software is available to support Analysis and
Translation from Sanskrit to English or German?
Thank you very much in advance,
