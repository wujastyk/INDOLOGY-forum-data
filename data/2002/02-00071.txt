hamsa (2)
Dear Lance,
You're right, of course. Hamsa often denotes the goose, which was
rejected in English translations for the reasons you describe. But
this has led to a blanket translation (goose) for all uses. Hence the
importance of Vogel's work. My concern is that 'goose' doesn't
always fit...
