How notes were kept and books were made?
Dear Allen,
I have written on "premodern" manuscripts called bADas or notebooks (also
vahI) in Marathi that were kept by kirtankars and that certainly resemble
"notebooks" in that they contain notes on the performance of kirtan, as
well as notes on astrology, rates of trade for certain items, prescriptions
for home remedies, notes on births and deaths, etc.  Most of the
manuscripts are from the 17th-19th centuries.  I can share this information
with you off-list if you would like.
Yours,
Christian
