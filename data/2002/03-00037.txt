Subject: J R Ballantyne's Sanskrit Work: nyaayasuutrakaumudii
Message-ID: <161227070693.23782.1001129903731768350.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Among the old books I acquired in Pune some years ago is a Sanskrit work
composed by J.R. Ballantyne (1813-1864).  It is written in the style of
Tarkasamgraha, but tries to reconcile Indian logic, epistemology, and
metaphysics with western ideas of the time.  The colophon at the end of the
first Adhyaaya reads: iti zriimaj-Jems-BaalaNTaina-viracitaayaaM
nyaayasuutra-kaumudyaam prathamo 'dhyaayaH samaaptaH.  My copy contains the
first two Adhyaayas of this work.  At the end of the 2nd Adhyaaya,
Ballantyne says that he will consider the concepts of saMkhyaa and
parimaaNa in the next PrakaraNa.  That indicates that he intended to
continue the work, though I have no idea if he ever did.  My copy does not
have a cover page, and hence contains to info about where and when this
work was published.  If anyone has come across this work, I would like to
know more about it.  Thanks.
