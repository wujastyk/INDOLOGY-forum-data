Dear Ulrich,

have you taken a look at Mahesh Raj Pant's introduction to his edition of 
JAtarUpa's commentary on the Amarakoza? (Delhi 2000: Motilal Banarsidass) 
Pant provides a meticulous description of the two (Nepalese) manuscripts he 
used, including the orthographic peculiarities you described, and going 
further beyond.

The variations you describe are well-known, I believe, both for Newari and 
other scripts, but as far as I know, it is not certain whether their 
distribution can be attributed to clear-cut patterns of historical 
development, so that e.g. gemination would generally be more frequent in 
earlier mss., and less frequent in later ones. However, I must admit that I 
am not really up-to-date in palaeographic discussions on these issues.

Unless you have already been in touch with her, I would suggest contacting 
Anne MacDonald in Vienna, who is critically editing the first chapter of 
the PrasannapadA, and who will no doubt have a well-informed opinion on 
these questions.

Best regards,
