Subject: Samaranganasutradhara translation?
Message-ID: <161227071559.23782.3945403581601264829.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

A patron has been told that there is an English translation of the
Samaranganasutradhara of Bhoja.  As far as I can tell there is no
complete one.  I seem to recall hearing of a collaborative project for a
number of scholars to translate it chapter by chapter.  Is this memory
accurate?  Have any partial translations been published?
