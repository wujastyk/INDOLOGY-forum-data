Friends:

Can someone enlighten me about the latest thinking regarding the date
of AzvaghoSa, the Buddhist writer? Richard Robinson places him 13 CE
and Keith around 100 CE.

Second, what is the latest thinking about the ascription of
Vajrasuuci to AzvaghoSa.

My own interest is in the dating of Manu. His work is clearly cited
in the Vajrasuuci, which would be the earliest citation if it is
actually a work by AzvaghoSa. Thanks to all in advance.
