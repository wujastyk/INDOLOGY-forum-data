tardy response to two questions
Dear Friends
If I remember correctly one of the early Chinese visitors to India (Hsuan
Tsang?) had heard of AzvaghoSa and translated his name as ma-ming =
`horse-voice'. This suggests that in the seventh century or so, the Indians
understood his name to name just that.
