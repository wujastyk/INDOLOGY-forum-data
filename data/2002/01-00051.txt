Dear Indologists.

I would like to announce the next incarnation of the South Asia Language
Analysis (SALA) Roundtable, to be held at the University of Iowa, June 21-23,
2002. This annual small conference generally atttracts scholars in modern
Indic languages, but also has a regular smattering of Sanskrit-based papers.
Because I am one of the co-organizers this year, I encourage more than the
usual number of submissions for papers on Sanskrit grammar, linguistics,
sociolinguistics, etc. Please inform your colleagues of this.

Thanks,

Fred Smith
