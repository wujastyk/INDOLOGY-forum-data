A list of institutions and persons concerned with Sanskrit              and              associated studies
Dear list-members,
could anyone tell me, whether there is any textual
support to the statement that GaNeSa writes with his
own broken tusk and not with a quill, because quill is
meant only for mortals?
                  Best regards,
