Inclusion in new Portal website (fwd)
Nice to know the INDOLOGY website is attracting high-profile attention
like this.  This also draws attention to the field of Indology itself, at
a national level in the UK, at least to some extent.

Inclusion in new Portal website
Dear Resource Owner
The British Academy, the United Kingdom's's
national Academy for the
Humanities and Social Sciences, is developing a
web site, PORTAL, which
is a directory designed as an entry point to
academic resources available
online for researchers working in higher
education.
Your resource:
INDOLOGY: Internet Resources for Indological
Scholarship
located at:
http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgadkw/indology.html
has been selected for inclusion in this
directory, and a link has been set
up to your site. Each directory entry gives the
title of the resource, its
URL, a number of
keywords and a brief description. I append for
your information copies
of the policy statement on the choice of sites
for the directory and
its copyright and disclaimer notices.
Entries also include some basic cataloguing
information. We hope that
appearing in our directory is acceptable. If it
is, and to ensure that the
cataloguing information is accurate, could you
please confirm that your
resource is hosted by:
University College, London.
If you would prefer that your resource is not
cited in PORTAL, please
let me know and we will not include it.
Responses can be sent by replying to this
email, or by post to:

1. PORTAL Collection Policy
Selection of sites for the PORTAL Directory is
based on the following
general guidelines:
Resources:
The resources at the site are within the
general area of the Humanities and
Social Sciences.
The resources are appropriate for research in
higher education or similar
scholarly contexts.
The resources can be:
primary resources e.g. electronic texts, image
archives, bibliographies;
secondary guides to primary resources, e.g.
collections of site pointers,
lists of specialised archives;
general reference data e.g. encyclopedias,
library directories.
Sites:
The site has substantive content, i.e. has a
large resource or range of
resources e.g. holdings of text or data, not
just an individual student's
bibliography.
The site has long-term content, i.e. has
material of continuing interest
e.g. excavation catalogues, not just a
particular conference programme.
The site shows that it aims to meet normal
research and scholarly practice
in choosing and making public its materials.
The site clearly declares who is responsible
for it.
The site content is actively maintained.
The site has proper functionality i.e. active
links, working tools etc.
The site offers free use, i.e. there is no
subscription charge, though users
may be required to register.

reference at any time.
