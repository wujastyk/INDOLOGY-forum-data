Zaunakaadisuutra
Dear colleagues,
D.B.K. Rangachari (The Sri Vaishnava Brahmans. Bulletin of the Madras
Government Museum. New Series. General Section 2, 2. Madras 1930 [first
repr. Delhi 1986]) writes: "Amongst the Archakas those who follow the
Bodhaayana, Vaikhaanasa and Zaunakaadi suutrams are entitled to worship
God in temples. This is so as rules pertaining to worship are given only
in the Grihya suutras of these three suutras." (p. 100)
Does anyone know what is meant by "Zaunakaadisuutra"?
I have two associations:
1) The KauzikagRhyasuutra of the Zaunakazaakhaa of the Atharvaveda.
2) The AAzvalaayanagRhyasuutra (according to a legend, Zaunaka was the
teacher of AAzvalaayana).
I would greatly appreciate any further ideas or references.
Yours sincerely,
