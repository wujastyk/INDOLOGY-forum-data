sharing documents: in praise of PDF
Acrobat or any other PDF producing program (Ghostwriter was mentioned)
should work with any program, whether Windows-based, Mac-OS-based, or
DOS-based.  Essentially, when you create a PDF, the document is "printed"
to a file, a first step in the printing of any document, but instead of
reaching your printer, it is redirected to a file on your computer and then
converted to a PDF file.  My point is that if you can print your document
from WP 5.1 for DOS, or whatever program you use, to any commercially
available printer, then you can also create a PDF.
As to the earlier WP question, I am able to create PDFs from WP documents
that have both diacritics and macros.  I'm using version 9, but I think any
version should work, as I mentioned above.
I hope this helps.  And for those of you who do not want to buy Adobe
Acrobat or another commercial PDF writer, you might try these sites the
offer free, legal solutions for writing pdfs from most programs:
