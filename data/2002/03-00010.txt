Bhishma=?iso-8859-1?Q?=B4?=s death
Dear Prof. Georg von Simson,
I am very glad for your response and information. I have to read your
paper right away.
This incompatibility interests me. I have been consulting Prof. Michio
Yano and Prof. S.R. Sarma, now guest professor at our School, about
calendrical descriptions in the epic. I will let you know if we find
something new or interesting.
So much on this net.
With best regards,
Tokunaga
