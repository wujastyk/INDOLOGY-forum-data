hamsa, goose and swan
It does not help me much in my search for the
link between praa.na and the sun, but: Yes,
etymologically hamsa is indeed ghansa (cf.
Mayrhofer) whereas swan, the singing bird (?),
has perhaps something to do with sv?nati and
latin sonare (at least acc. to Duden
Herkunfstwoerterbuch s.v. Schwan; unfortunately
the online indo-european dictionary is still only
starting up and I could not find a suitable lemma
for swan/zwaan/Schwan at
http://iiasnt.leidenuniv.nl/ied/index2.html).
Please, Dominik, request Julia to enlighten us on
the overlap between hamsa and swan.
Best, Jan
