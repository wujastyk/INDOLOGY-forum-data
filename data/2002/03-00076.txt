Dear members of the list,

I am interested in finding the source for an article on "Dardestan"
by Nigel Allan and D.R. Edel'man, of which I found a photocopy in
Knut Kristiansen's papers.

It begins on p. 26 of the work and begins:

        The term Dardesta-n once described the extreme northwestern
region of the Indian subcontinent, extending from Kashmir to Kabul
(Emeneneau).

I would be most grateful for the title, year, publisher and place of
publication of the work.

With best wishes,

Ruth Schmidt
