A reference to Hitopade/sa
Dear Christophe
The word hitopades'a is not common in the Pan~catantra. I am currently
undertaking a close reading of  the Purn.abhadra recension as part of my
doctoral research project. It is used in the sense of 'good advice'. There
is an instance in the Third Tantra around page 195 in Hertel's critical
edition. I can supply the exact reference if you are interested.
Yours
McComas
