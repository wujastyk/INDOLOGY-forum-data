However, one may note that the Kashmiris (Syamilaka through Bilhana) make
fun of the Gujaratis (e.g., of their style of wearing dhotis).
Syamilaka if of course rather early, probably too early (c. Hun time) for
the entry of the Gu(r)jara into the subcontinent (at 600 CE?-- not yet
found in Mbh;-- note the Gujar herders  in the S. Kashmir hills, and
Gujranwala in Panjab).
However, their presence may have give rise to some 'unorthodox' behavior,
though I cannot think of a specific item.  Of course, we have some 100
subdivisions of Gujarat Brahmins, so there is ample space for a 'HuuN'
version of them  (as indeed found in Rajasthan). --
By  1700 all of this may have become a topos.
Also, there are the *early* (BSS/BDhS) Karaskara --I think in Saurastra--
who are 'off limits' for 'proper' people, just as Andhra, Kalinga  etc. was
forbidden territory: when one traveled there  one was in need of a
prayascitti  - an early 'kala pani'.
We have to ask the Gujarat  specialists.
