Dear Kenneth,
since your query includes the middle east: Al-Biruni
in his encyclopedic work on India refers to an
anecdote according to which Socrates would have
answered to urgings by friends to put his thoughts
into writing: "I don't want to transfer thoughts from
the living hearts of men to the dead hides of sheep".
Or something similar. I gave the reference at the end
of my article "The ritual pragmatics of a Vedic hymn:
RV 1.164 and the Pravargya ritual", JAOS 2000.
