FW: COPAC loads British Library catalogue (fwd)
COPAC is a union catalogue for all the major academic / university
libraries in Britain.  It is increasingly becoming a valuable one-stop way
of finding books.  The addition of the BL catalogue projects it into a
very important position.  Apart from anything else, the COPAC interface is
(I think) nicer than the BL's own one.
