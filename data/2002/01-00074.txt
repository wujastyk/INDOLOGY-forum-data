Kedaramahatmya
One more text that should be mentioned is the
Kedaaramaahaatmya in chapter 21 of the  Tiirthavivecanakaa.n.da
of Lak.smiidhara's K.rtyakalpataru. The verses quoted there are
attributed to the Deviipuraa.na.
An early source is the original Skandapuraa.na, which in the
chapter on "Siva's aayatanas (SP 167) has a number of verses that
deal with Kedaara.
Hope this helps,
