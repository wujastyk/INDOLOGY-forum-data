References to China in Sanskrit lit
I am not sure whete "100-200 years upt to I cent AD" came. I am not
sure whether I wrote this. Be that as it may, yes, I do not think the
Artha as we have it goes back further the 1st cent BCE -- if that. My
only point was that "ciina" probably did not enter the Indian
vocabulary earlier than 1st cent BCE -- it of course could have been
much later. AND whether "ciinapatta" refers to China is quite another
issue.
