In the 17th-18th century text Vedavicaara that I am editing and
translating, there is an interesting line explaining why the draaviDa
brahmans of the south do not have any interaction/co-participation with the
gurjara brahmans, though the gurjaras are technically considered to be
draaviDas.  The text says:

gau.dadezavad gurjaradeze 'py anaacaarabaahulyaat te.saam
aacaaryazaapa-dagdhatvaat keraladeziiyabraahma.naadivat
samvyavahaaraabhaava.h

Like the the GauDa region, there is profusion of misbehavior (anaacaara)
even in the Gurjara region, and hence, by being cursed by the aacaarya
(who?), there is no dealing with them, as there is no dealing (for similar
reasons) with brahmans from Kerala etc.

I wonder if anyone has come across this story of some aacaarya cursing the
brahmans of Kerala and Gurjara regions for their supposed misbehavior?  I
suppose the anaacaara in Kerala refers to the relations of brahmans with
nayar women.  What sort of anaacaara is alleged for the Gurjara brahmans?
