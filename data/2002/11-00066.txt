The Indic universe gave birth to four major world religions, as well as a
vast diversity of schools of metaphysical thought and religious practice.
It has witnessed dramatic and sometimes cataclysmic encounters with
non-Indic religious traditions.

The sub-continent also nurtured several persecuted religious traditions
(e.g., Jews, Zoroastrians, Bahaiis) from different parts of the world.
Within the Indic world, the diverse communities developed innovative ways
of living together that are being continuously reworked, as well as modes
of religious dialogue and renewal that often altogether bypass theological
differences. Through this process, they evolved many common cultural
symbols, socio-religious practices and codes of behaviour that facilitate
non-antagonistic coexistence among them, even while they retain their
specific identities. Consequently, the dividing lines between various
religious communities as well as between folk and classical religious
traditions have retained a great deal of fluidity and complexity.

And yet, too often, the interrelations of ethno-religious communities
living in the sub continent have been viewed in the scholarly literature
through simplistic and misleading stereotypes. It is surprising and ironic
that in contemporary India the scholarly study of religion has not become
a well-established discipline within the academic world. While many of the
highly regarded universities in various parts of the world contain
well-developed departments for the study of Indic religions, no university
in India hosts similar rigorous programmes of religious studies.  One of
the consequences of this failure is the continuing hold of misleading
stereotypes of the nature of Indic religious thought and practice.

This Conference aims to encourage rigorous secular studies of religious
traditions in India: Hinduism, Zoroastrianism, Jainism, Buddhism,
Neo-Buddhism, Christianity, Islam and Sikhism including their various
sects and branches.

The Conference also hopes to establish a process for bringing together on
a regular basis scholars in India who are working in the field of religion
to promote the study of religions in India as a rigorous secular
discipline.

Panels, symposia and individual papers are welcome on themes that include,
but are not limited to the following, offered as examples: 1. Studies of
traditional religious texts with a special focus on:


- Notions of the common or public good; norms about accumulating and
sharing income and wealth;

- Ideal forms of gender, generational, conjugal and familial relations;

- Theories of kingship, justice and political authority; - Relations
between the divine and mortals, rulers and ruled, nature and human beings.

2. Interrelationships among religious dogmas, theologies, philosophies,
folk beliefs, and actual practices; varying concepts of the canonical in
religious traditions

3. Historical and contemporary studies of

- The growth or decay of syncretic traditions in religious texts,
practices and norms;

- The role and functions of dharmasthans, pilgrimage centres as well as
the control and management of religious institutions;

- The rise, decline and renewals of shramanic religious traditions within
Indic civilisation

4. The politics of religious conversion historically and/or in
contemporary India; Limits of religious authority within specific systems
of religious beliefs, norms, and practices for participants, dissenters
and outsiders.

5. The historical and contemporary impact of the rise of nationalism on
religious beliefs and practices, Gandhi's religion, and Hindu-Muslim
relations in 20th Century Indic civilization.

6. Special methodological concerns in the study of religions within Indic
civilization, and ways of approaching their resolution.

7. Contributions of Indic religions to cosmological speculation in 20th
century science.

symposia to the Programme Committee chaired jointly by Professors T. N
