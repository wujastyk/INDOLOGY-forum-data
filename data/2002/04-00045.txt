Manu
My humble opinion,
You should do what works best for you, since it is clear from the recent
exchange on the subject you will inevitably disappoint some and please
others.
Having said that, as someone who has done some typesetting, I enjoy the
challenge of comlex layouts, such as have been proposed. However, with 1200
pages, I think it would be rather more costly to your publishers (and
therefore to your readers), to lay out text, translation and notes on facing
pages.
With two (or more) volumes, and a big desk, one can acheive the same effect
as facing pages, by having both volumes open at the same time. But this
won't help those who like to read on the bus.
And for what its worth, I'm very happy that Monier Williams comes in a
single volume.
