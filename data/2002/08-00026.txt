Chinese in India

I haven't got time to dig out the references but while "ciina" or better
still "mahaa-ciina" does refer to China, it is clear from Buddhist texts
dating from the early medieval period (C6-8th) that "ciina" often refers to
Tibet and some Indo-Tibetan border areas to the east in Assam.
