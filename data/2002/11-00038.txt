b. with a and pl. An instance of this; a heretical opinion or              doctrine.
I accept most of John's comments.  However, I very much doubt that the Buddhist subordination of Brahma and Indra to the Buddha was not deemed "heretical" by others and that it was "non-confrontational."  The evidence from the Puranas like the Vishnupurana account that Vishnu takes the avataara as Buddha to teach false doctrines to demons so that they will be permanantly doomed is a reflection of how such mythological warfare was carried on.  No wonder that Shiva is depicted in the Shivamahapurana as destroying the city of the Asuras after they were deliberately led astray by a Jain-monk incarnation of Vishnu.  Also consider the Hindu accounts that Raavana had put all the gods in his prison, and needed to be freed.  So I would carefully look at the mythological counter-stories as evidence of confrontational feelings on various sides.  I cannot imagine Brahmins in ancient times not being shocked to see representations of tiny Indra and Brahma at the feet of imposingly tall statues of the Buddha offering homage to him.
