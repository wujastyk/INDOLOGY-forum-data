It would help me a lot if anyone who has access to the Marathi publication
listed below, perhaps Allen Thrasher at the LC, could look it up and see if 
it gives any information on a Sanskrit pandit named Zaamazaastrii Dravi.da
Dvivedii.  This person belongs to 1750-1800 AD.  I am editing and
translating a Sanskrit work, Vedavicaara, by this pandit, but we have no
other information about him.  Chitrav Shastri's Madhyayugiin Caritra Koza
may possibly have some information on him.  The Vedavicaara itself survives 
in one manuscript dated to Zaka 1746 and a printed edition from Vai, 1912.
The edition contains no information about the author.  Any help is welcome. 
Thanks.
