Agastya's Birth in a Pot
Thanks to Dr.'s Vielle, Garzilli and Tokunaga for such timely and precise
suggestions. This is a welcome boon. Unlike the ocean, you have NOT
forgotten the one who was born in a pot (see Candraloka 8.5).
                          Gratefully,
                          David Mellins
