Dear Dominic (et al).:
My feeling on the new evidence presented by Cribb & Sims-Williams--and also
now by Falk in Silk Road Art and Archaeology-- in favor of  dating Kaniska
in the first half of the 2nd century AD is that it is persuasive but not
conclusive. In legal (American) terms, it would (if I were the judge)
constitute "a clear preponderance of evidence" [standard of proof for a
civil suit], but not "proof beyond a reasonable doubt" [standard for
criminal case]. I therefore lean toward a second century date for Kaniska,
but with the proviso that the 78 AD date is still not absolutely ruled out.
I have alluded to this issue, though not discussed  it in detail, in two
forthcoming articles, one in JAOS, the other in Bulletin of the Asia
Institute.
