Ah, once again I have fallen victim to the mindless 'reply' function!

please forgive me.

Much as I would like to share a few things with all of you, alas, it
is not possible. (The desire to meet all of you is, however, real,
and I can think of no place more lovely than Oslo. That indeed I look
forward to!)

With sincere apologies, jonathan silk
