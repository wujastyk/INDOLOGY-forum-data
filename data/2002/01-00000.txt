Subject: Query on Telugu (?) writing on a conveyance
Message-ID: <161227070098.23782.15550372814880138279.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear listmembers,

A friend sent me a photo of what appears to be a colorfully decorated
Christian ambulance cart with calligraphy along the top canopy part. (The
photo does not include the mechanism of attachment for hauling this thing,
but it resembles a similar style of horse-drawn conveyance I found in
Madurai, so I am guessing it's a cart and not part of an elaborate
three-wheeler.)  Am assuming the writing is Telegu because the photo was
snapped in Andhra Pradesh.  If someone could volunteer to translate the
writing for me I could send you a jpg attachment.  Please advise,
Hopefully, Joanna Kirkpatrick
