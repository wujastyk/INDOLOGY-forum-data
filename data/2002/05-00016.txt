Dear Professor Chevillard,

Please accept my apologies for not responding sooner to your request for
information on this matter.  I have been away for several days at a
conference, and now I must depart for a few more days to retrieve my son, who
is returning home from school.

I will try to offer a response to your questions upon my return.

Best wishes,

George Thompson
