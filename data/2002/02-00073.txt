Indian ornithology
Earlier I tried to send an image of the Mauryan Vajrasana with its
"Geese" but we are restricted from sending images on this Indology
listserv  so it bounced back.
However in our Pala  (ca. 750-1300) sculpture archive, Sarasvati
occurs 23 times and is on a lotus with no vahana.
She occurs in the Nepal Iconographic database (all from drawings in
iconographic manuals of the 18-20th centuries) six times and is only
on a lotus if anything. The few stone images that we have photographs
of her in Nepal are also on lotuses. no Hamsa of any species
As for Gandhara, We have about 6000 images of Gandharan material in
the archive, including a good many stair casings on which mythic
animals are carved, lots of birds but no swans
such a survey is hardly definitive, but identifiable swans are not
commonly represented in Indic art before about 1300.
