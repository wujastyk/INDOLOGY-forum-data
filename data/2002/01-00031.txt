Message-ID: <161227070164.23782.11240772902549137821.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear colleagues,
could anybody give me info on Vasubandhu's treatise "Vyakhya-yukti"?
Does it exist only in Tibetan, or are there at least some parts of
the Sanskrit original? Do you know any translations or studies of the text?
Many thanks in advance,
                                        Ya.V.
