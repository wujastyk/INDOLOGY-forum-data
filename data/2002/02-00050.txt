Dear Dr. Friedlander,

Many thanks for making the Memorandum on the Census of British India of
1871-72 and the General Report on the Census of India for 1891available
on the web in digital format.  This greatly increases its utility (as
well as its ready availability) of this valuable resource.  I am using
it to track particular forms of religious practice and the application
of the ethno-religious categories "Aryan" and "Vedic" in the 19th
century.

The adding of more such material to your site will be an great
contribution to S. Asian studies.

Yours appreciatively,
Tim Lubin
