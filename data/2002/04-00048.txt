Personally, I would prefer a single volume with Skt text to the left and
the translation to the right (opposing pages), and with the notes etc. at
the bottom of the page. In other words: all info relevant to a given
verse/set of verses immediately available to the eye. It may make the page
look cluttered, but it is infinitely more practical than having two
volumes, which involves a more laborious shift of focus.

Good luck!
