swans
My I humbly note that although the sawn is not an indigenous Indian bird,
swans migrate to India from Russia during the winter.  As I pointed out last
February on this topic, the following should apply to the appearance of a
swan bird at l;east in the Indian northwest:
Mute Swan:
Palearctic, Nearctic, Ethiopian: The mute swan breeds in the British Isles,
north central Europe and north central Asia. It winters as far south as
North Africa, the Near East, and to northwest India and Korea.  (Reilly,
1968; Granlund, McPeek, and Adams, 1994)
