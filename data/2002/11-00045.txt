References to China in Sanskrit lit
Hello Patrick,
  100-200 years up to I cent. A.D. It, nevertheless more real date KA.
  Reflection in shastra a concrete material (and a mention of China - the concrete fact)
  hardly could take place both under laws of a genre, and for other reasons (hardly it is possible to assume,
  that the Chinese merchants for the first time have brought their goods in I cent. AD and at once this information
  has been included in KA). Opinion of K.P. Jayaswal, that ciina = Zina, in my opinion is not absolutely correct.
