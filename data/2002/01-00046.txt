Kedaramahatmya
Dear Paolo,
Many thanks for the information about the VAyu PurANa;  I had my doubts when
I found a reference to a KedAramAhAtmya in it (via the _Epic and Puranic
Bibliography_, if I remember correctly), so I am glad to have them
confirmed.  As you note, the KedArakhaNDa of the Skanda PurANa does not
really deal with Kedarnath at all, only with Shaiva myths.
Yours
John
