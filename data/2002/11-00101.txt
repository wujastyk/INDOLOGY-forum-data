15. The South Asian Literary Recordings Project [Real Audio]
http://www.loc.gov/acq/ovop/delhi/salrp/

Undertaken by the Library of Congress' New Delhi Office, this impressive
project was designed to create an audio archive of South Asian authors
reading their own work in the original language of its publication. The
project began in earnest during April 2000, and by September 2002 (when
this
site was launched), eighty authors had been recorded. The site features
readings in 22 different languages, including Hindi, Bengali, Sindhi,
Gujarati, Nepali, and English. The authors reading in English include
some
of the most prolific and accomplished South Asian authors of the last
century. Those featured readings on the site include Keki N. Daruwalla,
Anne
Ranasinghe, and Mulk Raj Anand, whose career has spanned over
seventy-five
years. Additionally, a brief profile of each author is included with
their
representative audio recordings. Persons interested in learning more
about
South Asia's vast and prodigious literary tradition in the 20th century
will
find this site a valuable resource. [KMG]
