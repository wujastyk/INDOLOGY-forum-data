Chakravarty
Dear Hans,
I should hasten to add that my frame of reference is, as you know, Bengal!
And so I was speaking for the provenance of the name in that part of South
Asia.

Dear All,
Does anybody know whether Chakravarty, or any of its spelling and
pronunciation variants, is ever used as a name by brahmins?
