Many thanks to Peter Bisschop for noting the source of one of my
Atharva"siras verses in Paa"upata Suutra 5.35-38, which I had not
noticed (despite having looked for quotations from PaaSu before!).  The
Li*nga-Puraa.na verse he mentions is in fact part of a versified
paraphrase of the entire Atharva"siras that begins with LP 2.17.9cd.

Dear Timothy Lubin,

For the second part of your second quotation cf. Paa"supatasuutra
5.35--38:

chittvaa do.saa.naa.m hetujaalasya muulam (5.35)
buddhyaa (5.36)
sa.mcittam (5.37)
sthaapayitvaa ca rudre (5.38)

The complete verse also occurs in Li"ngapuraa.na 2.18.40.
