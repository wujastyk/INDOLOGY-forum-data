May I have your mailing address please?  Somehow I have lost it, and
--very belatedly, I am afraid--I would like to send you a few things,
just before we move to Los Angeles.

I much regret I lost the chance for us to meet again in Oslo--I was
so much looking forward to it.

warmest greetings, jonathan
