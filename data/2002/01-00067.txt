Any suggestions!
I have been working with a Sanskrit MS produced in
Gujarat about the same time and also with some MSS in
Tamilnad (Tanjore and Chennai) transliterated from the
Grantha and Telugu scripts into Devanagari by the
local scholars (not Marathi speakers), apparently in
the 19th and the beginning of 20th c. The peculiarity
of writting 'ddha' as 'tdha' and even as 'tddha' (at
random) is quite common to all of these. Moreover, the
MS from Gujarat has been published by the Maharaja
Gaekwad Royal Court in Vadodara by a native of Pune
with the same 'tdha' in many places.
              Hope, this also helps.
                  Regards,
