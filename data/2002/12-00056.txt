About Russian  Veda
As far as I remember, Mr Barashkov has based his
fantasies mostly on the songs and ballads collected by
various researchers in the 19th-20th centuries (like
Gilferding). Some of the texts have traces of the
Slavic pagan cults. Ironically, more information about
these cults is found in the Christian works against
Slavic paganism, etc. What exactly are you interested
in?
