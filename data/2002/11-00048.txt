Insects in Buddhism
Dear Netters,
a colleague of mine, who is not a member of Indology, has approached me
with a query regarding the approach of Buddhism towards insects, vermin
etc.
- apart from, and in addition to the general notion of "abandonment of
harm to sentient beings". He has in mind such instances as using
insecticides against vermin
destroying people<fontfamily><param>Tahoma</param>'</fontfamily>s crops
or killing "noxious" insects such as wasps or hornets
endangering human life, or farmers inadvertently killing dew-worms.
Are there any specific textual references to insects you may be aware
of?
In appreciation of your metta and karuna,
Jan Filipsky
