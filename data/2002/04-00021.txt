CTamil list moves to an institutional server
Dear Liverpool Indology list members,
this is an annoucement that the CTamil (=Classical Tamil) list,
which was started on 2001 April 18
as a "younger sister list" to the Y-Indology list
(on the same Yahoo! server)
is from now onwards hosted by a UREC/CNRS server.
The CTamil list is a Forum for those with a special interest in Classical
Tamil .
The reasons for moving to an institutional server were that,
although we valued very much the initial one-year experience
of living on a Yahoo! server, some other list members
and myself were worried about the future stability (or instability)
of the quantity of data which comes, in the course of time,
to accumulate on these transient servers,
that are mostly supported by advertising.
We do wish to see the collection of posts on Classical Tamil
be usable as a reference tool on the web
with a not too short life span,
as the Liverpool Indology list has been since 1990
(if my memory does not betray me)
The new list home page is:
