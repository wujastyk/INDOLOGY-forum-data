Gnoli Felicitation Volume (fwd)
Dear Raffaele,
I have just seen your announcement of the Gnoli Fel. Vol. Before possibly
placing an order it, would be helpful for me to know whether the contributors
will receive a copy of the book, or an offprint of their articles, or both, or
neither of them?
Second, since there is only one month left for me before my departure from here:
how many units exactly do you expect me to teach? Should I teach a class and if,
on what level? Or give one / several lectures? Or would it be more advisable -
in view of our Mokospaya (-Tika) cooperation, to read selected passages from
Bhaskara?s commentary - as I once suggested it already to Bruno?
Awaiting your instructions,
Yours,
as always,
Walter
