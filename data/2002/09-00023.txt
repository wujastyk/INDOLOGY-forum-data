Two place names
I've got a MS that mentions a teacher called Vihaariilaalami"sra Gau.da,
of Argalaapura.  And another place, I.s.takaayatha graama.
I've found one Istikapatha in the Nilamatapurana, apparently near the
Chenab river.  Neither Argalapura nor Istikapatha are in Schwartzberg or
BC Law.
If anyone knows anything about
        Argalapura
        Istikapatha (/Istakapatha/Istakayatha etc.)
        Viharilala Misra Gauda
I'd be very grateful.
Thanks,
Dominik
