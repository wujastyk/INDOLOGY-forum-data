Calendar
As far as I can see, there was no full moon in Caitra corresponding to
Saturday in 1503 CE. My guess -- assuming that your author calculated his
tithis with reasonable accuracy -- is that you want 30 March, 1504 CE
(Julian calendar), which was a Saturday. The nakshatra would then be Citra
for most of the day.
