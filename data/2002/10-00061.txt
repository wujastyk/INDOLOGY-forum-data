Subject: Paris bookdealers : from seller's point of view
Message-ID: <161227071540.23782.17423555230974090814.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Could anyone recommend which of the French Orientalist or other
antiquarian bookdealers to recommend to some people who have inherited a
large library of the classics of Western South and Southeast Asian
studies, presently in storage in France?  They live in the U.S. so they
want to deal with it as expeditiously as possible.

I am also posting this on the CONSALD and CORMOSEA library lists.

Contact me privately if you don't want your comments public.

Thanks,

Allen
