Just a few details from:

 http://faculty.washington.edu/kpotter/ckeyt/home.htm


Jose Ignacio Cabezon, "Vasubandhu's Vyakhyayukti on the
 authenticity of the Mahayana sutras", TCon 1997 221-244

Peter Skilling, "Vasubandhu and the Vyakhyayukti
 literature", JIABS 23.2, 2000, 297-350


I've read neither so cannot comment except to say that I've found some
of Cabezon's other papers useful.


Many regards,

 Richard Mahoney
