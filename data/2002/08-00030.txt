addition/correction on Chinese in India
I am now reminded by a colleague that there were also two
somewhat later Qin dynasties (later than the texts I work
on, hence beyond the range of my peripheral vision), the
Former and Latter Qin, dated 351-394 and 384-417 CE
respectively (yes, there is an overlap). *If* it is
the case that there is no certain use of the Sanskrit
term ciina prior to the mid-4th century, these dynasties
would also be possible candidates for its source.
