Here's a delightful classic title - the author had an "omen-nomen":
Vogel, Jean Philippe, (1871-1951). The goose in Indian literature and
art. Leiden, E. J. Brill, 1962. vi, 74 p. 12 plates. 28 cm.
Vogel points out that the swan as such is not native to India. The
haMsa is - of course - a goose.
Cheers,
Alex
