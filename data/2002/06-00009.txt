Which number the naada indicates?

Just as a footnote, appendix I in M. Rangacarya's edition and tr., "The
Ganita-sara-sangraha of Mahaviracarya with English translation and notes"
(Madras 1912) has quite a good list of bhutasankhyas.  Not particularly
better than the above or L'Inde Classique's, but it does include some
specifically Jaina terms like bandha = 4 etc.  (Also svara=7, but no naada
or sabda etc.)
