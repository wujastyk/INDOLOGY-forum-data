Paa.ninian description of German
Re. Jan Houben's suggestion "for Paniniyas":
In the early 1960's, John Brough, during a seminar, gave a very amusing and
clever analysis of a bit of English in Paninian sutra style - about a page
of them as I recall - but it was just an entertainment - albeit illuminating!
