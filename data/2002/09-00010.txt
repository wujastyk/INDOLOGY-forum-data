A list of institutions and persons concerned with Sanskrit and              associated studies
Dear All,
I have just printed the extremely useful ``German Indology: A list of
institutions and persons concerned with Sanskrit and associated
studies'' from:
 http://www.fak12.uni-muenchen.de/ind/german-indology.htm#Anfang
Does anyone know of a similar list which covers France and Italy? I
have seen the pages available at:
 http://www.iias.nl/iiasn/iiasn4/guide/guide.html
Unfortunately, these are a little dated.
Many regards,
 Richard Mahoney
