Kh instead of S in Yajur Veda
Just to be more specific, the change of .s to kh takes place in the
Maadhyandina trandition of the Zukla-Yajurveda, where the passage i.se tvaa
is recited as ikhe tvaa.  The Maadhyandinas are found mostly in north
India, their southernmost expansion reaching the region of northern
Maharashtra.  I think there is a likely regional/dialectal connection of
this pronunciation with northeastern regions, where in Prakrits/Pali one
often finds kh for Sanskrit .s, for instance lakkha.na for
lak.sa.na/lak.sma.na.  This mode of recitation in the Maadhyandina YV is
probably a relatively late development, as I see no reference to it either
in the Vaajasaneyi-Praatizaakhya or the Yaajnavalkya-zik.saa.  Best,
