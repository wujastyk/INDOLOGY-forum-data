Subject: Tamil and other South Asian publishing in Scandinavia?
Message-ID: <161227070318.23782.4672833164427527398.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

A colleague is going to Scandinavia primarily to investigate publishing
among Turkish immigrants and guestworkers, but will as he has time look
into developing country migrants there.   My impression is that a lot of
the South Asians in Scandinavia are Tamils.  Is this correct?  Could
anyone give me addresses for him to investigate in Scandinavia of Tamil
or other groups or publishers?

Thanks,

Allen
