Finite karman/destiny patterns?
Has anyone come across, within any Indic religious tradition, a doctrine to
the effect that there exist a finite (albeit great) number of possible
human life-patterns -- or in other words, a limitation to the variety of
karmic manifestation? Such a view seems to underlie certain (late)
astrological texts which I am studying, and I would be very interested to
know of any parallels.
Best regards,
Martin Gansten
