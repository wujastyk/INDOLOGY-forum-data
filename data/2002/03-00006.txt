I discuss the chronological problems of the Mahabharata battle in an
article ("Narrated time and its relation to the supposed Year Myth in
the Mbh.") published in Mary Brockington and Peter Schreiner (ed.):

In Mbh. 13.153.27, shortly before his death, Bhisma mentions that he
has been lying on the bed of arrows for 58 nights. But you are right:
"Descriptions are confused in the epic." I, too, come to the
conclusion (p. 60):  "... there is no consistent chronology with
regard to the events around the battle. There seem to be different
traditions, incompatible to each other ..."
