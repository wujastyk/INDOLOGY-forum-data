Any suggestions!
Allen has indeed brought up an important question.  I wonder how one would
go about distinguishing between orthographic versus calligraphic
interpretation.  In my manuscript, I find zraatdha for zraaddha, zutdha for
zuddha, sitdha for siddha, batdha for baddha.  However, I found one
instance where one clearly reads prasiddha and not the expected prasitdha.
This one instance tells me that the copyist can calligraphically
distinguish between -tdha- and -ddha-, though in 99.99% of the cases, he
uses -tdha-.  With this data, what might one conclude?  Best,
                                        Madhav
