Martin and Michio:
Thanks for your ideas. Let me give you the text itself, because there
appears to be some confusion:  zriisaMvat 1560 varZe caitramaase
sukla [broken ms] nakSatre paurNamaayaaM tithau zanivaare . So there
is no indication about what Samvat this is; but given that this is a
Maharastrian ms. it is likely that it is Vikrama. Hope this helps.
