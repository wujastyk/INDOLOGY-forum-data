For nasals and gemination, Cardona's article on nasals may be of
interest of yours.  Although it is not about orthography, after reading
it, I found the features (when or when not to geminate the next
consonant after r, lack of certain gemination, use of anusvaara or
monoorganic nasals, disappearing visarga) found in Malayalam MSS very
interesting.

I wonder if the article was published, and if it it was, where.

Also, Indoskript project <www.indoskript.de> seems promising.
