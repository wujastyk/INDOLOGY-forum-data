Which number the naada indicates?
Dear List Members
Could you tell me what actually means naada that is used to express a
particular number in dating an inscription from Nepal? The line reads as
such:
      naade skandamukhe hy anaNgavishikhe nepaalasam.vatsare
As I think, naada usually cannot be a synonymous with svara that expresses a
collection of seven musical notes and resultantly implies 7.
Rather naada is one of the synonyms of shabda (e.g. Amara I.6.22c-23).I am
curious to know whether shabda and/or its synonyms indicate  a certain
number or not?
