garzilli> Actually RV VII.33.11 refers specifically to Vasistha's birth.

One may also refer to st.13, in which Maana=Agastya is born
simultaneously (Geldner's note on 13c and his footnote, RV, Vol.I,
p.237, fn.1). Thus the story goes back to the RV.

I coundn't find the actual episode of his birth from the pot (besides
the naming) in the main text of the MBh (Cr.Ed.).
