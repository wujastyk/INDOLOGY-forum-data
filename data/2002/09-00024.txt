Istikapatha
I've found a concrete reference to Istikapatha in Yasuke Ikari's _A study
of the Nilamata: aspects of Hinduism in ancient Kashmir_ (Kyoto, 1994).
Ikari also points to Rajatarangini 3.467, where I. is a place where king
Ranaditya goes for austerity, said by Stein to be the modern Ramaradan
(74:56 long., 34:19 lat.).
Nothing on Argalapura, though.
