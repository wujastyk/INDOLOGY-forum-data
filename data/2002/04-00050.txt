Manu
May I offer an opinion on Manu?
As a potential user, I like to have all the relevant material open in the
one place. Personally, I prefer interlinear/inter-paragraph texts with
footnotes. Perhaps the bulk of the critical apparatus will not allow this.
What about two 600-page volumes with with half the text/translation
together in each?
For what is is worth, I have put up a completely uncritical bilingual
version of Manu at

Here is a quick-and-easy screen grab of what I have done:
