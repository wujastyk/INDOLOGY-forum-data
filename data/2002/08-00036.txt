suggestions for a name for a hospital
Apologies for sending an unfinished and unsigned email to the list.
It seems to me that they need a name that (a) has a suitable meaning;
(b) is easy to pronounce, and sounds pleasant, for people unfamiliar
with Sanskrit (or whatever language is chosen); and (c) doesn't sound
as though it denotes a centre for one religious tradition only.
Tricky!

PS  Also to people who didn't know the background, "Tara" might just
sound like a child's name, which would presumably be OK.
