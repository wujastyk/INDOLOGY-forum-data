3-year Fixed-Term Contract
Commencing ?21,815 p.a. inclusive
Vacancy 01-134

Applications are invited for a newly established Research
Assistantship in Tibetan Studies within the Department of the Study
of Religions, contributing to the digitisation and access enhancement
of the Tibetan Dunhuang manuscripts at the British Library.  The
principal task of this Research Assistantship consists in the
compilation of a fully descriptive analytic catalogue of a
substantial portion of the Library's Tibetan Dunhuang manuscripts.

The successful candidate will be well-grounded in Tibetan canonical
Buddhist literature and possess an active research interest in Tibet
and Central Asia. The appointee must also possess basic computer
literacy, since s/he will be expected to input data into an
electronic catalogue  besides contributing to the development of a
Tibetan studies teaching resource. Since the appointee will work in
close collaboration with the International Dunhuang Project, it is
essential that s/he can operate effectively in a team, while, at the
same time,  being capable of working unsupervised for extended
periods of time. A PhD in the field of Indo-Tibetan Buddhism is a
prerequisite for the appointment.

Membership to USS will be available.
