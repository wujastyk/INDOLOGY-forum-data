Thus I think the meaning of the appelation dinakhaya-sam.kraanti to the
Makara-sam.kraanti is intelligible. Now only remains to be seen whether the
word under scrutiny is attested in the Dharmashaastra literature.
Meantime, Dr Harry Spier endeavoured to make me understand the term basing
himself on jyautisha. Many thanks.
