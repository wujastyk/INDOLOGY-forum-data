Sanskrit Knowledge Systems on the Eve of Colonialism
        I would like to draw the attention of all interested parties to the
website for "Sanskrit Knowledge Systems on the Eve of Colonialism", a
collaborative research project exploring the structure and social
context of Sanskrit science and systematic knowledge from 1550 to 1750,
a period which winessed a rich flowering of Sanskrit scholarship in many
fields, yet ended in a radical diminution of Sanskrit's cultural power
with the coming of colonialism.  The project, funded by the National
Endowment for the Humanities and the National Science Foundation, is
organized and directed by Professor Sheldon Pollock of the University of
Chicago, and combines the researches of a dozen scholars from seven
countries. The project website is at
<http://dsal.uchicago.edu/sanskrit>.  The website contains the project
proposal, information on and working papers by project participants, and
will soon provide access to digital images of unpublished manuscripts
gathered in the course of the project, and to the database of Sanskrit
works and authors from the period which will be constructed as part of
the project.
