Request for article by Vogel
Dear Indology-list,
I am in need of a brief article by Jean Philippe Vogel entitled "Sanskrit
kirti" published in "Bijdragen tot the Taal-, Land-, en Volkenkunde van
Nederlandsch-Indi?", vol. VIII, 5 (1906), pp. 344-348.
Unfortunately, this journal is not avaible in Denmark. Would it be possible
for anyone, who has access to this journal, to send me a photocopy of these
couple of pages?
Sincerely,
Ulrich T. Kragh
