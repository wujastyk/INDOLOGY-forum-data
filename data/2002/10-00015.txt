SV: Scanning of devanagari
Thanks Richard!
I have tried using I.R.I.S. which came with my Hewlett-Packard
all-in-one, but apparently successful scanning partly depends upon a
wordlist in the scanning program which is able to recognize context.
I.R.I.S can scan Chinese and Japanese, but apparently no South-Asian
language.
