Heresy   doctrine.
Madhav is quite right to point out the the Brahmins would not have
liked the subordination of Brahma and Indra-- Certainly not. My
intention was to point out that there is not confrontational rhetoric
about how awful the Brahmanical traditions were in Buddhist
literature. Such is limiteed to the conversions of various Brahmins
and their followers. Bad enough, I suppose to an unconverted Brahmin,
but not horror tales such as we have in the Christian discussions of
Mani
