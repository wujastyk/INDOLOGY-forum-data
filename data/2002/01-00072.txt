Any suggestions!
Alternatively, this practice might simply reflect the fact that
before voiced (aspirate) stop the contrast voiced : voiceless is
neutralized, so that it from the perspective of phonological contrast
it doesn't matter how we write that sound. A more wide-spread
parallel is the common variation between anusvara and homorganic
nasal before stops where, again, there is no contrast between the two
in that particular environment.  To check on whether this makes sense
it would be helpful to see what happens in cases such as zabda
(written zapda??) or labdha (lapdha)?  If these are not written with
voiceless stops, then a more idiosyncratic account, possibly in terms
of calligraphic concerns (or more down to earth, some notion of ease
of writing), would be more appropriate.
