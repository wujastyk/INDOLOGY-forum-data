Buddhism as Iranian heresy?
See for a start
Boyce, Mary. A history of Zoroastrianism. 3rd impression, with corrections.
Leiden ; New York : E.J. Brill, 1996,
and other works by Boyce--as I recall, she somewhere mentions possible
influences or at least parallels to Buddhism and includes references. I
don't know if anything more recent has appeared.
