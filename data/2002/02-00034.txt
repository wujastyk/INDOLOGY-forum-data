How could you leave out Persian?!
As a participant of the project, I can say that we are very aware of the
kind of linguistic and epistemological plurality that George refers to.
I hope that people will be interested in the writing and ideas that come
out of this project, and not judge it merely by it's title. But it's a
good title, I think, and it manages to say something important, even if it
doesn't capture quite everything the project is about.
