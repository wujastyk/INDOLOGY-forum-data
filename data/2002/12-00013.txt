Weights and Measures
Hi Patrick,
I believe you might find something in the following but I don't have it
here so have not been able to check:
D. Chattopadhyaya, History of Science and Technology in Ancient India: The
Beginnings, Calcutta: Forma KLM, 1986.
("KLM" might be correct or my typo for the Dutch airline).
And then there are more ancient and never seen by me:
L.D. Barnett, Antiquities of India, London 1913
A. Bose, Social and Rural Economy of Northern India, Vols.I-II, Calcutta
1942-45.
If all fails you obviously have to go to Calcutta whence all these tomes
emerge.
Greetings
