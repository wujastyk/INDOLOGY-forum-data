Advanced notice: change of INDOLOGY website address
I was informed two days ago that as of August 2002, the website addresses
for personal accounts at my college, UCL, will be changing from
  www.ucl.ac.uk/~userid
to
  www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~userid
This change has already been implemented, and at present, both addresses
work.  If you try
  http://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgadkw/indology.html
you will find the INDOLOGY page.
The website address
  http://www.indology.org.uk
will continue to work as normal. It will shortly be updated to redirect to
the new "homepages" address.
Please inform me of any difficulties or dead links.
