Calendar
Friends:
Could someone more adept at calendars and conversion programs be able
to help me with a date? Samvat 1560 [= 1503 CE], month Caitra,
fullmoon day [naksatra given but the name is torn in the ms], and it
is a zanivaara [Saturday]. What day and month of the year would this
be? Thanks.
Patrick
