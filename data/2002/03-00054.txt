Three/four watches
Dear List members,
There are three watches in the night in the Pali Canon account of the
Buddha's enlightenment.
By the medieval period Indian time used four watches, as in Hindi poetry
about the asta-jam, eight watches of life (night and day)
Any ideas when India switched from three to four watches for the night?
