Urdu mss at Library of Congress
The Library of Congress has a collection of several dozen Urdu
manuscripts, most  acquired recently.  If any scholars of Urdu have some
spare time during the Washington meeting of AAS I would be glad to bring
them to the reading room by preappointment for their examination so that
they could advise us on which are most important and should be cataloged
and preserved first.
Feel free to forward this appropriately.
