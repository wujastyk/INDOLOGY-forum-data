Tirtha Patas
Dear colleagues,
working on historical pilgrim maps of Banaras I have studied two rare pictorial
maps of the 18th and early 19th century.
I have found a few references to Tirtha Patas as "sacred hangings" painted on
cloth in order to have darshana of tirthas for those who are unable to travel.
These references are all found in the context of Jaina ritual. I would be
greatful for any further information about the practice of producing Tirtha
Patas in the context of tirthayatra.
Best,
