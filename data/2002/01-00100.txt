Publications of the Indica et Tibetica Verlag
Dear members of the list,
    In response to the enquiry of Dr. Fosse I would like to inform you that
a somewhat out-dated list of titles published by the Indica et Tibetica
Verlag can be found through my homepage: staff-www.uni-marburg.de/~hahnm.
The list will be updated before long and brief descriptions of the content
(in English) of the books will be added. The prices in the list are given in DM,
however the Euro price is obtained by simple conversion (plus rounding up to the decimal), e.g. 24 DM = 12.30 Euro.
    The books can be obtained directly through the publisher. Colleagues and
private customers will be allowed a certain discount. In this case prepayment  is required.
