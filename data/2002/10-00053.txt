In those cases where the large prose units ("book", "chapter", etc.) cannot be broken
down into smaller ones with the help of interspersed verses etc., one way of
referencing is to combine the references to these units with those to the page AND
paragraph. The page number is provided by the edition itself, while the paragraph
numbering is fictitious.

For better orientation I would suggest to attach the reference to the beginning of the
paragraph, followed by a colon. The entire reference should be put in brackets or
other symbols THAT SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSE, e.g.:

{3.2;p.134,3:}    or alternatively    *3.2;p.134,3:**
i.e., Book 3, Chapter 2, page 134, paragraph 3.

With the help of these brackets/symbols, references can later be defined as "Hidden
Text" (or some such feature of word processing programme) and suppressed to
avoid "arbitrary break up". Variants can be added in the same manner.

This procedure works on all platforms from DOS text upwards, which I for one would
consider essential.

Best regards
