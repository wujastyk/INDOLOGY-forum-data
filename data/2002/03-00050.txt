I tried, with my pancanga program, the year before (AD 1502) thinking of
the possiblity of the year number as current instead of expired or it is
Karttikaadi instead of Caitraadi, but the weekday did not fit.
I do not understand how Virakma 1560 corresponds to AD 1504.
I wonder whether it is really Vikrama Samvat.
