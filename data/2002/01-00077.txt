nAsty udyamasamo bandhu.h
Dear list,
I am looking for the source of the following half-"sloka:
   nAsty udyamasamo bandhu.h kurvA.no nAvasIdati
According to Apte, Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary,
s.v. ava-sad-, it is from Bh[art.rhari], but I have been unable to
find it D. D. Kosambi's edition with pAda index.
The quote appears on Rasmus Rask's gravestone in the
Assistenskirkeg?rd in Copenhagen, cf. http://www.assistens.dk/rask.htm
(if anybody is interested, I can email him/her a better photograph).
Thanks,
Stefan
