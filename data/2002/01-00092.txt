This issue seems to be arising everywhere.
As you can see my mailer---Mutt---fails the test, perhaps because its
a text based mailer that defaults to iso-8859-1, I'm not sure.
But for all that I like my mailer the way it is. Its fast, it does
threading, I never have to touch the mouse, it runs in a terminal, it
can easily process more than 300 messages a day in less than 20
minutes ... and so on 8-).
On the whole, I prefer US-ASCII or iso-8859-1 for e-mail. With
transliteration I find it perfectly adequate. I suppose its main
advantage is that absolutely everyone can read it---no matter how
ancient their software or beast.
And here comes the link ...
