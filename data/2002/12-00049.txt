Agrahara, gurukula, pravacana query (fwd)
RE. pravacana
One of the earliest or the earliest use of pravacana to refer to a "text"
(but the point is that it isn't a text) is the Srauta Sutra of Baudhayana.
It uses expressions such as "That direction" when the composer/teacher
obviously pointed in a certain direction. See W. Caland, Uber das rituelle
Sutra des Baudhayana, Abhandlungen fur die Kunde des Morgenlandes, 12/1
(1903) 1-65. Reprint Kraus 1966.
On B.'s time and place see M.Witzel, "The Vedic Canon and its Political
Milieu," Inside the Texts/Beyond the Texts, Harvard Oriental Series, opera
minora, 1997: 316-7.
