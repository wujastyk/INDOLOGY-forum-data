Anaacaaras of the Kerala Brahmins
Dear Madhav, 
        There are several -- only partly overlapping -- lists of the 64
anaacaaras of the Kerala Brahmins, the oldest and best known being
included in the S'?nkara-Smrti. My wife has focused on these rules and
studied how far they still apply in Kerala, and I have edited and
translated the original text of this passage of the S'?nkara-Smrti and
its Malayalam commentary in the appendices of her book:
Parpola, Marjatta, 2000.  Kerala Brahmins in Transition: A Study of a
Namp?tiri Family. (Studia Orientalia, 91.) Helsinki: The Finnish
Oriental Society. xii, 436 pp., 55 ill., bibl., index. Pb 34 Euro. ISBN
951-9380-48-5. 
The cheapest and quickest way to get the book is to order it directly
from the distributor, the bookshop of all learned societies in Finland:

Finland
tel. +358-9-635177

The preferred mode of payment is by credit card; if you are faxing the
credit card number, please give also the cvv or cvc code, i.e. the
3-digit number shown on the signature side of the card.  If the payment
is made by cheque, the rather high costs of cashing the cheque have to
be added.
With best regards,  Yours,  Asko
