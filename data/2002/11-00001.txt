Buddhist verses
Quoting Madhav Deshpande <mmdesh at UMICH.EDU>:
aakaa"sa.m (NKP verra's aakaa"sau was I suppose a typo) dvau nirodhau ca 
nitya.m trayam asa.msk.rtam is exactly  J~naanasaarasamuccaya 21ab (though I 
wouldn't exclude that there might be earlier occurrences). (See K. Mimaki's 
contribution to Jonathan A. Silk (ed.): Wisdom, Compassion, and the Search for 
Understanding: The Buddhist Studies Legacy of Gadjin M. Nagao. Honolulu 2000.) 
I have seen some other citations of the line (and of the whole verse) in 
Buddhist tantric texts.
This famous, very often quoted, line is Pramaa.navini"scaya 1.55ab.
Aside from the Abhidharmako"sa, the other text that NKP verra should check is 
the Tattvasa.mgraha of "Saantarak.sita. 
for instance looks like a variant (or corruption) of Tattvasa.mgraha 2323cd. 
Excuse brevity of reply and incompleteness of bibliographical references, due 
to lack of time.
