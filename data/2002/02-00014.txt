Subject: eye (gaze) in the Katha Upanishad
Message-ID: <161227070415.23782.3744192442411472605.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Thanks--

I also inquired on another list about a citation in a Buddhist sutra. The
only reply so far cites the Threefold Lotus Sutra, and as I understand, that
did not originate in India.  Can you tell me if I'm correct here or not?  I
am looking only for indigenous Indian sources of this concept or figure.
