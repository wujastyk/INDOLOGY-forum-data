eye (gaze) in the Katha Upanishad
Thanks--
I also inquired on another list about a citation in a Buddhist sutra. The
only reply so far cites the Threefold Lotus Sutra, and as I understand, that
did not originate in India.  Can you tell me if I'm correct here or not?  I
am looking only for indigenous Indian sources of this concept or figure.
