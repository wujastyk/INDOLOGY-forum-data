Dear Patrick,
This may be of interest to others so I respond to your query thru
"Indology" since I have an answer (or opinion).
As you know, I published two very large volumes called AGNI. Years later, I
asked the then head of Univ. of California Press (Phil Lilienthal) if he
would have done it differently if his press had published the books. He
answered right away: "We would never publish two such large volumes; very
inconvenient for the user. I would have advised to turn it into four."
Years of lugging around one or two of those huge tomes have added substance
to my conviction that he was absolutely right!
Come to think of it, the publisher of  the three volume Apte dictionary
also did the same though Monier-Williams OUP had not done so. But MW was
earlier I believe so Apte editors leant from the earlier mistake.
The only reason to the contrary is if you were interested in developing
your arms.
As for "votes," it is better to follow reasons, in my opinion; but in the
final resort: do as you like!
best,
