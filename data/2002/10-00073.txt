Good question, though rarely asked.I have been collecting materials on
this point for the past few years. See the summary in HOS-Opera Minora 2,
1997:

"The Development of the Vedic Canon and its Schools: The Social and
Political Milieu." In: Inside the Texts, Beyond the Texts. New Approaches
to the Study of the Vedas. Harvard Oriental Series. Opera Minora, vol. 2.
Cambridge 1997, 257-345

More to come in March 2003 (in German).

As far as I know, apart from most of Ashoka's inscriptions, there is only
one inscription in Magadhi, see O. v. Hinueber, Ueberblick... (Wien 1986 &
new ed. of last year).

((Pali is of course not = Magadhi, but based on a western dialect))

With silence, as far as I see, also by Ashoka, since he put up a pillar at
(Rummin-dei, S. Nepal):  hida Buddhe jaate...
