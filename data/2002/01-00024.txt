This solution is only applicable to Windows applications
(like for instance WordPerfect 9, etc.)
and is of course, as pointed initially by Dominik,
the most convenient (and I join in the praise of the Acrobat format ;-)

But I think our colleague was referring to the fairly widespread use
(by many of our colleagues here on this side of the Atlantic at least :-)
of the DOS application called WordPerfect 5.1
as adapted (in the eighties) by our late colleague R.E. Emmerick, in Hamburg
[See <http://www.sub.uni-goettingen.de/ebene_1/fiindolo/gret_ree.htm#RV>
  for a few technical details]

This means that, in order to be able help our colleagues
who are still using R.E. Emmerick software solutions
(and there are some here in Paris also),
the wizard he is trying to invoke :-)
should be able to create a PDF file
starting from the files created by the DOS program WP5.1

Any DOS wizard online?
