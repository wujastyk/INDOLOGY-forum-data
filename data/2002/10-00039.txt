utf-skt works
Dear Dominic,
just in time before the new term demands full attention I have
completed a first attempt for utf-skt, a style file for formatting
Sanskrit (both transliteration and Naagarii) with Unicode (utf-8)
input and multilingual Omega-TeX.
[...] I would be grateful if you could make the location of this package
known for testing:
www.indologie.uni-halle.de/software/utf.htm
Kind regards
Juergen
