hamsa, goose and swan
Dear Friends,
Forgive me for entering into a private conversation but I think the
swan is a Central Asian Bird that was domesticated by Eastern
Europeans and others.  It was certainly a game bird in the Kurgans at
Pazyryk in the trans Altai.
If there was a species of swan in early Indic regions it would be
interesting to know
