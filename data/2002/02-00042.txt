hamsa, goose and swan
Yes, I am sorry that it throws no light on sun and breath but I do agree
that Dominik should please ask Julia to enlighten us but not without paying
pranams to my late countryman J.Ph.Vogel (= bird) who planted in my brain
the idea that hamsa, apart from the etymology, also means "goose". Or so I
recall, perhaps erroneously since I cannot now find his monograph "The
goose in Indian literature and art" of 1962 (Leiden: Brill).
