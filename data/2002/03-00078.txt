stem (?) of munja grass
"Grass" in English explanations of mu;nja may owe itself to someone's
'mechanical' translation of the traditional gloss t.r.na-vi;se.sa. However,
in Skt usage t.r.na is not restricted to what we call grass in English; cf.
t.r.naraaj 'vine palm,' t.r.na-raaja 'cocoa-nut tree,' 'bamboo,'
'sugarcane,' 'palmyra tree,'  t.r.na-v.rk.sa 'fanpalm tree' and t.r.na;saala
'areca-nut tree, ' 'bamboo' recorded on p. 782 of Apte's dictionary enlarged
by Gode et al.  These identifications show some uncertainty or conflation,
but they establish that t.r.na is not confined to what commonly makes lawns.
