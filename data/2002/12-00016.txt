ConTeXt support for UTF-8 Roman Translit and Nagari
I met Hans Hagen at the recent TeX conference in Trivandrum, and he
mentioned among other things that he was planning to put support into
ConTeXt for critical edition formatting.  Could be very valuable,
especially with all the other features ConTeXt has.  I've never used it
myself, though.
Best,
Dominik
