Subject: history of text of the Avesta
Message-ID: <161227070750.23782.12809928953553409673.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Could anyone provide me with a bibliography of the process by which the
text of the Avesta was generated, transmitted, fixed, and the transition
to its being written down?  I am interested in possible parallels and
divergences with these process in the case of the Vedas.

I posted this on the largely quiescent Indo-Iranian group and got no
response except for someone who expressed a similar interest.
Thanks,

Allen Thrasher
