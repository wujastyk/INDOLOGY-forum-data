SV: Manu
Thanks to all those who responded to my query about Manu -- one or
two volumes. I received several interesting and helpful comments. The
vote however is divided down the line -- half wanting a single volume
and half a single volume -- the latter especially in view of the fact
that the translation alone will be published in the Oxford World
Classics series.
Thanks again.
Patrick
