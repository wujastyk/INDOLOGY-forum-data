I agree completely.
One of my Tamil teachers was a Nayanar, and he described the caste as 
"as low as one can be without becoming an untouchable". In this he was 
reproducing (with a bitter mien and tone of voice) what brahmins had 
wanted him to believe. But a Jaina Nayanar will laugh at a brahmin who 
tells him that he is 'low'.
The question of just who is 'high' and 'low' often remains open, esp. 
in South India. E.g., Brahmins in Karnataka look down upon Virasaivas, 
but the latter are quite capable of doing exactly the same in return, 
just like Jainas.
