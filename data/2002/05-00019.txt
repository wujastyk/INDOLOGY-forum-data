J. Nepal Res. Centre XII & the NGMPP
Among all the terrible news of V.S. 2058, it is however with a sense of
accomplishment that we can look back to more than30 years of the
Nepal-German Manuscript Preservation Project. The project, begun by the
late Prof.s Janert and Kolver in 1970,  has been officially  concluded this
spring.

The project has virtually shaped a whole generation of German Sanskritists
(and Tibetologists) in providing a long and sustained experience of a
living Hindu and Buddhist culture that was, until some decades ago, almost
untrammeled by outside influences.
Those who  have participated in the project have experienced the "Kathmandu
High" of an exhilarating nature and climate, and the warmth of the Nepalese
people, and they look back, with gratitude, to their stay in Nepal as some
of,  if not as   t h e   best years of their lives.
At the occasion of the conclusion of  microfilming -- the project continues
apace with more detailed cataloguing--  a sort of Festschrift dedicated to
the project has been brought out as Vol. XII of the JNRC -- this journal
being another outcome of the activities of the project and of its members.
The volume contains papers by many of the participants of the NGMPP and by
a few specially invited scholars.
Details below.
