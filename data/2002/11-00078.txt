King words
Dearest friends:
Nasmate!! I am looking the more used words in the Mahabharata for Kings: raja, nripa or some thing like that?? I haven't any sanscrit editions or lingusitic studies about this in my area. So, could of your gently personas scholars in sanscrit send one answer , bibliographical references??. It os for my thesis work.
