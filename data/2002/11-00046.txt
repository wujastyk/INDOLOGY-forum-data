Insects in Buddhism
Dear Jan,
Suggest that your friend apply to the academic Buddhism list known as
Buddha-L.
Since he doesn't subscribe, he could send a query to the main moderator,
Prof Richard Hayes, asking if Hayes could put his query on the list. He
would need to supply an email address so people could reply to him off list,
unless he wants to sub.
Prof. Hayes's email is richard.hayes at mcgill.ca
Regards,
Joanna Kirkpatrick
