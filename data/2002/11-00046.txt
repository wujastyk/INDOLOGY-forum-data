Subject: Insects in Buddhism

Dear Jan,
Suggest that your friend apply to the academic Buddhism list known as
Buddha-L.
Since he doesn't subscribe, he could send a query to the main moderator,
Prof Richard Hayes, asking if Hayes could put his query on the list. He
would need to supply an email address so people could reply to him off list,
unless he wants to sub.
Prof. Hayes's email is richard.hayes at mcgill.ca
Regards,
Joanna Kirkpatrick

 a query regarding the approach of Buddhism towards insects, vermin etc.
> - apart from, and in addition to the general notion of "abandonment of
harm to sentient beings". He has in mind such instances as using
insecticides against vermin
> destroying people's crops or killing "noxious" insects such as wasps or
hornets
> endangering human life, or farmers inadvertently killing dew-worms.
> Are there any specific textual references to insects you may be aware of?
