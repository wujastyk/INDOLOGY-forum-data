Call for Papers

The Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS), in collaboration
with India International Centre, will host a regional conference of the
International Association of the History of Religions (IAHR) in New Delhi
from December 18-21, 2003.  Last date for submission of abstracts: December
15, 2002.  Final date for confirmation of accepted proposals: January 31,
2003.

The dates of the conference have been shifted from December 11-14, 2003 to
December 18-21, 2003, in response to requests from several participants.

The conference aims to encourage rigorous secular studies of religious
traditions in India: Hinduism, Zoroastrianism, Jainism, Buddhism,
Christianity, Islam and Sikhism, including their various sects and
branches.  Furthermore, in order to promote the study of religions in India
as a careful secular discipline, the conference hopes to establish a
process for bringing together, on a regular basis, scholars in India who
are working in the field of religion.

Topics might include, but are not limited to:  1) studies of traditional
religious texts with a special focus on notions of the common or public
good; ideal forms of gender and familiar relations; theories of justice and
political authority; and relations between deities and mortals, rulers and
ruled, or nature and humans; 2) the interrelationships among religions
theologies, canons, philosophies, practices, and folk beliefs; 3)
historical and contemporary studies of growth or decay of syncretic
traditions in religious texts and practices; the role and function of
pilgrimage centres, as well as the management of religious institutions;
and the rise, decline, and renewal of shramanic traditions within Indic
civilisation; 4) the politics of conversion in history or in contemporary
India; and the limits of religions authority and the role of dissenters and
outsiders; 5) the impact of nationalism on beliefs and practices; Gandhi's
religion; and Hindu-Muslim relations; 6) special methodological concerns in
the study of Indic religions; and 7) the contributions of Indic religions
to cosmological speculation in 20th century science.
