Identity of placename Mohapaata?
Just spoke to a Mr. Palnitkar here in Detroit.  He confirms that his family
is from the village of Mohapaa.daa near Panvel (near Mumbai).  The copyist
of my ms, Hari Vi.s.nu Pa.lni.tkar must be one of his great great grand
uncles.  This is our Sanskritized Mohapaata.  Best,
