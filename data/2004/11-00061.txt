Devanagari
For Ms Word users only:
I have written a small macro (100 lines) that converts the selected text (in 
roman characters, Unicode encoding, e.g. Times IndUni or Gandhari Unicode 
font) to Unicode Devanagari (e.g. Arial Unicode MS or Sanskrit 2003). Of 
course it is slow, on my system 2500 characters / sec.
It has been tested for Microsoft Word 2002 (running under Windows XP Home 
Edition), but it uses fairly standard Visual Basic programming only, so 
probably it works with other versions as well.
I have no homepage, but I would be pleased to send it in e-mail to anybody. 
(If some of you could host it on their homepage, that would be wonderful).
Greetings,
