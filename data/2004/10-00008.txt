Dear Indologists,
Could somebody provide me and the list with the Sanskrit text of fifteen
verses devoted to the story of Puruuravas and Urva/sii by the Gujarati
author Dyadviveda (15th century) in his Niitima?jarii (somewhere p. or ?
325 in the 1933 ed. by Sitarama Joyrama Joshi according to the only
reference I have).
At least its length appears to be exactly the same than the /sloka-passage
quoted (composed?) on the subject by the Keralan .Sa.dguru/si.sya in his
Vedaarthadiipikaa ad SA ad RV 10.95 (ca 1187), which itself was quoted
again with some variants by Saaya.na (ad RV 10.95).
Thank you very much
