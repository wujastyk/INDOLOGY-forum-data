The Hindu editorial on BORI
See

It's worth noting that a month or so ago, the editor of the Hindu and
several reporters were arrested and ordered to spend a month in jail
by the Tamil Nadu assembly (Jeyalalitha's party).  They were
subsequently released by the Indian supreme court.   The party
members were miffed by an unfavorable editorial that appeared in the
first half of the year.  I find the editorial on BORI quite eloquent
and moving.  G. Hart
