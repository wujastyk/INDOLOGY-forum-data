Kautilya
Be careful.
R. Shamashastri translation is strongly obsolete (1915) and to use it hardly
reasonably. Only rather qualitative translation is prepared by the author of
the critical edition R.P.Kangle (it was publicated in India 1969, 1972,
1986, 1988, 1992 etc.).
But this translation simply is not present in a network.
