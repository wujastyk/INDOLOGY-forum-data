Manu
Friends:
Hope I am not violating any rules of personal promotion -- but since
many of you over the years and months have asked me about the
critical edition of Manu --
I am pleased to announce that the critical edition (translation and
notes) has finally been published by Oxford University Press, New
York. My web site (http://asnic.utexas.edu/asnic/olivelle/index.htm)
will continue to list all errors of this edition, as well as that of
the translation published earlier in the Oxford World's Classics
Series.
Thanks.
Patrick
