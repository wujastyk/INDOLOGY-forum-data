Good News

The National Geographic Announced today at 12:00 EST that they have
completed inventorying more than 22,500 objects of gold ivory and
other materials from the Kabul Museum that had been hidden in vaults
in Afghanistan.  I am sure your papers will be full of things but I
thought you would like to be alerted to the news early on
