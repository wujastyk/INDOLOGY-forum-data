Subject: SV: History of Sanskrit studies
Message-ID: <161227075232.23782.540741027851513927.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Without wanting to blow my horn too much, the following two 
papers, co-written with Rajeshwari Pandharipande, may be 
useful too, although their focus may be a bit narrow.

The sociolinguistic position of Sanskrit in pre-Muslim South 
Asia.  Studies in Language Learning 1:2.106-38, 1976. 

Sanskrit in the pre-Islamic context of South Asia.  Aspects 
of sociolinguistics in South Asia, ed. by B. B. Kachru & S. 
N. Sridhar, 11-25.  (= International Journal of the Sociology 
of Language, 16.)  1978.  [Condensed version of the preceding 
item]

Cheers,

Hans Henrich Hock
