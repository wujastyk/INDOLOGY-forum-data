BhG bhasya 2ndary sources
Dear members of the list,
Could anyone recommend a good article-length study of the commentaries of 
Sankara and Ramanuja on the Bhagavadgita?  I?m looking for a source that would 
be appropriate to give to an class of advanced undergraduates, without 
presuming any knowledge of Sanskrit, thus nothing philological as such, rather 
a piece of intellectual history.  I expected to easily find an overview of the 
interpretations of the great commentators, their differing strategies towards 
the BhG, their understandings of key terms, their positions on maayaa and 
theism, etc. but have thus far met with no success. 
Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks in advance,
Whitney Cox
