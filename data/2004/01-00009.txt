attack on Professor S. Bahulkar
Dear Reinhold and Lars,
Europe is not, and, of course, was not, exempted
from comparable deplorable developments.
Interesting observations which perhaps express
some of the tensions and dilemmas underlying
current threats to "rational indology" I found in
Prasenjit Duara's recent article:
http://www.iias.nl/iiasn/32/genereal_news_duara.pdf
If the communication gap is crucial in the
contrasts and tensions between the old nations'
critiques of nationalism and the new nations'
promotion of ethnic/religious nationalisms, it is
all the more regretable that in Indological fora
like the present one the active participation
from Indian and India-based scholars is
practically nil.
