 From this point on the basic construct is pretty much set varying
elements come and go lion-like teeth, wings, scales, and something
auspicious comes out of its mouth, plants, animals, humans pearls
water and so on.

Between, India, Nepal, and Tibet, I have a great number of
photographs of makara, dating from the Lomas Rishi example, cited
above, down to modern executions.

I would be happy to send attachments of the two above and more if it
is desired, to anyone who would like to see them.

In short, as configured in art, the makara is not a living natural
creature but rather a mythic composite that is a fundamental source
of water, life essence and well-being and prosperity.
It compares to the dragon in China, the naga in India.
