Subject: Meaning of parasvat

Patrick Olivelle, in his translation of KauUp 1.2, translates parasvat as
'rhinoceros', rather than the 'wild ass' suggested by MW. He does note the
variant reading para?svat (MW: 'snake'), but as far as I can see, there is
no comment on the rhinoceros translation. Can anyone enlighten me on the
background?

Thanks in advance,
