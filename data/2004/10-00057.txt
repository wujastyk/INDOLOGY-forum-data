BJP election manifesto 1998
Dear Stefan,
Thank you for not making me look like a complete IT-ignorant!
Yours

You probably did not find it because the link to it from their main Election
Manifesto page
   http://bjp.org/manifes/manife99.htm
is broken.  So unless one is able to guess the direct URL, it is indeed
currently inaccessible.  But that is probably just a case of sloppy website
maintenance rather than of deeper political significance.
All best,
Stefan
