Fwd: Re: Question on Marathi phonology--Second Try
Hello Hans,
     The Marathi verbs tuT and phuT have short vowels, in contrast with the Hindi verbs TUT and phUT.  The related Sanskrit forms (as per Panini's dhAtupATha) are:
truTati/troTayati; Whitney also lists truTyati and truDyeyuH
sphoTati/sphuTati/sphoTayati; Here Whitney does not list sphuTyati
The dhAtupATha also lists a sphuDati (with sphoDayati as its
causative), suggesting that such voicing was dialectally already
underway. But this does not explain the contrast seen in the
Marathi forms.
