Hello Hans,

     The Marathi verbs tuT and phuT have short vowels, in contrast with the Hindi verbs TUT and phUT.  The related Sanskrit forms (as per Panini's dhAtupATha) are:

truTati/troTayati; Whitney also lists truTyati and truDyeyuH

sphoTati/sphuTati/sphoTayati; Here Whitney does not list sphuTyati

The dhAtupATha also lists a sphuDati (with sphoDayati as its
causative), suggesting that such voicing was dialectally already
underway. But this does not explain the contrast seen in the
Marathi forms.  

Madhav
