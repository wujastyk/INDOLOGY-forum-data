Hindi geographical names
Here are the few topographical names I am fairly confident about (in
Tokunaga-Fujii code), none of them are in fact Hindi, all are Oriya:
        ba.rheipaa.ni (if the falls inside Simlipal Tiger Reserve are meant)
        kendujhara
        khordaa
        koraapu.t
        (there are 100s of spellings, here is one:) Parlaakimedi
