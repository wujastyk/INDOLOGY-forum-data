Critical editions in Devanagari with LaTeX (ledmac, utfskt)

Dear Dominik,
thank you for your offer; indeed it would be very helpful to have your 
Ledmac and PDF files.
I still have to digest Richard Mahoney's suggestion, which is a little 
bit too advanced for me as a LaTeX neophyte.
Off-list, I also received some very helpful answers from J?rgen 
Hanneder. The unwanted separation of letters with virAma can be overcome 
by a different approach to separating strings in ledmac:
Instead of:
\edtext{\Nag{adhigam?d}}{\Bfootnote{some variant reading for 
adhigam?t}}arthasiddhi?
use:
\edtext{\Nag{adhigam?da}}{\lemma{adhigam?t}{\Bfootnote{some variant 
reading for adhigam?t}}}rthasiddhi?
The drawback is that the text then gets cut up beyond belief, and that 
it becomes rather cumbersome to search in it - unless there is some tool 
that allows you to search in LaTeX source files ignoring all control codes.
I also had difficulties with certain consonants and ligatures; they 
would just not get processed. J?rgen found out that these problems arise 
because the file uses both the devnag and the babel-german package, both 
of which make use of " as a special character. For the time being, it 
seems that I have to do without German hyphentation in critical 
editions, which is actually a negligible evil.
Many thanks for all replies,
best regards,
Birgit Kellner
