Dear Colleagues,

A colleague who is not on this list has asked that the following faculty
opening at the University of Michigan be announced. Thank you.

The Department of Asian Languages and Cultures at the University of Michigan
invites applications for a tenure-track position in HINDU STUDIES, beginning
in September 2005. Appointment is possible at any rank.  Applicants from a
wide variety of periods and fields within Hindu Studies will be considered,
but all applicants should possess a high level of proficiency in one or more
South Asian languages as well as the ability to teach undergraduate courses
on both historical and contemporary periods.  The successful candidate is
expected to teach a range of courses in Hindu Studies from introductory
undergraduate lecture courses through graduate seminars in areas of research
interest; to supervise doctoral dissertations; and to participate actively
in the programs of the departments as well as in area studies initiatives
within a larger university community that encourages interdisciplinary
efforts.  Of special interest are candidates who share a commitment to
historically-grounded scholarship that is both rigorous and original and who
are drawn to the intellectual opportunities afforded by programs of
significant contextual depth. Evidence of outstanding teaching ability and
of promise in research is essential. The Ph.D. is expected to have been
completed prior to appointment. Each application should consist of a cover
letter (describing the applicant?s scholarly work, teaching, and research
plans), a full CV, research statement, representative publications or a
writing sample, and at least three letters of recommendation.  Please send
applications to Hindu Studies Search, Department of Asian Languages and
Cultures, 3070 Frieze Building, The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI
48109-1285. Review of applications begins November 29, 2004. Applications
must be received by December 10, 2004 to be assured of consideration. The
University of Michigan is an Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action Employer.
Women and members of minority groups are especially encouraged to apply. The
University is supportive of the needs of dual career couples.  All
applications will be acknowledged.
