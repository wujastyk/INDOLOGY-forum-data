As it turns out, Madhav, in Marathi words of more than one 
syllable, long and short [u] have merged to short [u] (and 
similarly for the [i]-vowels); see Jules Bloch, Formation 
..., ?44. So that takes care of the length problem (and shows 
that the concern in my earlier message about vowel length 
does not apply to Marathi). 
Bloch, incidentally, in his index under tuTNeM directly 
compares Panj. tuTT-, Hindi tUT-, and derives all from Skt. 
truTyati (via Pkt. tuTTai).
All the best,
Hans
