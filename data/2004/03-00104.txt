Online ordering of Sanskrit and Prakrit MSS from the Wellcome              Library
The online ordering system for Sanskrit and Prakrit manuscripts from the
Wellcome Library has had a major update, and has moved from the main
INDOLOGY website page to the "Digital Art and Manuscripts" page of the
website:
        http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgadkw/indnet-art.html
The Wellcome Library has mounted a system for the online ordering of
paper, film, or digital copies of the 1000 MSS described in vol.I of the
library's Handlist of Sanskrit & Prakrit MSS.  The service could be
extended to offer similar access to the 1000 MSS described in vol.II of
the library's Handlist.  This would be subject to genuine demand from
users.  The library can be emailed at library at wellcome.ac.uk
