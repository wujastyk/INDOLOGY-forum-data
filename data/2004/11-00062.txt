Dear Dominik,
Hope all is fine with you!

Since the topic "sankaracarya arrested (in connection with the murder case
within the varadaraja temple)" is directly connected to my current research
project i would be very grateful if you could post a message to the Indology
list (unfortunately i am not a member) for me indicating that I would appreciate
every bit of information (print or electronic media, gossip, or elsewhere)
regarding this incident (address: ute.huesken at gmx.de).

Thanks a lot
Ute
