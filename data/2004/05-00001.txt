In my initial posting I asked if any readers had successfully converted
TBRC PDF files into TIFF files. At the time, I had not thought that
this question might be of interest to Gene Smith but I am pleased that
you mentioned it to him. If I understand his response correctly, it
seems that his organization does hold a master archive of TIFF
images. If so, there exist relatively inexpensive ways of
disseminating his holdings. One system of note is `IIPimage : High
Resolution Remote Image Viewing':

 http://iipimage.sourceforge.net/IIP.html

Once established, the cost of such a system both for the Server and
Clients should be reasonable.


Best regards,

 Richard
