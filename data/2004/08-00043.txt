Death of Fred Hardy
Dear List,
It is my melancholy duty to inform you that Professor Fred Hardy died on the
4th of August. Fred was a scholar of great integrity, massive erudition and
had a very keen analytical mind.
He had just retired as the Professor of the History and Philosophy of
Religions at King?s College, University of London.  Fred was an outstanding
scholar in both Sanskrit and Tamil and is best known for his two monumental
works:
The religious culture of India : power, love, and wisdom / Cambridge
University Press, 1994.
Viraha-bhakti : the early history of Krsna devotion in South India. Oxford
University Press, 1983.
As well as many other articles.
At the time of his death he had almost completed a number of other studies.
