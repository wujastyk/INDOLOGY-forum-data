Publication of Skt Buddhist texts of possible interest
I'm glad to know about this publication.  Thanks for the information.
I have a question, however.  The reference on the "Taisho Books"
website to a "facsimile edition" I find a bit mysterious.  Has a
facsimile edition been published yet?  If so, does anyone know by whom
it was published?
