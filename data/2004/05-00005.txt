Subject: the Sanskrit for Hand held attribute
Message-ID: <161227074460.23782.16619706181336634440.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear Colleagues,

Does any on the list know of a generic term for attributes in
Sanskrit or Buddhist hybrid Sanskrit?  The various weapons tools and
symbols held by Buddhist persona, all have names of which we are well
aware but after forty-six years the generic term, if there is one,
still eludes me.

Thank you all

John
