Ayurveda and the planets
Thanks, Dominik. I have heard of the Virasimhavaloka, but never seen it.
Does it, or any other text that you are familiar with, explicitly say that
vata corresponds to planet X, vata-pitta to planet Y, etc? I would be very
grateful for any such references, if they exist.
Regards,
Martin Gansten
