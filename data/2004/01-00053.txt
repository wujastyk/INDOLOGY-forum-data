Kannada self-study resources?
A friend who needs to learn Kannada has asked me for any useful
(English-language) resources related to the self-study of that language:
books, audio tapes, multimedia presentations, websites, etc. As I am
ignorant in these matters, I would be grateful for any tips (perhaps best
sent off-list).
Thanks in advance,
Martin Gansten
