Question
p. 22: One of the earliest Hungarian travellers in Central Asia was 
K?roly Ujfalvy (1842--1904) who settled in Paris in 1866 where he 
taught Hungarian and Finnish. He led three expeditions to Central Asia, 
and published most of his results in French.\footnote{``Les traces des 
religions anciennes en Asia C?ntrale et en Sud de l'Hindou-Kouch,'' 
Paris, 1883, or: ``Aus dem Westlichen Himalaja,'' Leipzig, 1884. See 
also the paper of S. Denison Ross on Ujfalvy, V?mb?ry and Stein in: 
JRAS, 1928, pp. 990--91.}
