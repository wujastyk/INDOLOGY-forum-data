Perhaps the technique of one common variety of domestic fowl is worth
mentioning ...
I've often seen the sole remaining Rhode Island Red hen hunting in the
garden. Having stalked or run down a large spider or small lizard she
lowers her head and quickly strikes the victim a good number of times
before rising. She will not think twice before assaulting a gardener's
hand in the same fashion. With this beast around it is unwise venture
outside without a thick pair of leather gloves ;-)
Perhaps an Indian snake was reputed to strike more than once?
