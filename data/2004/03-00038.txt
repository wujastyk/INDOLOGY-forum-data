Whereabouts does the "rma 'dral-ba" occur ?  I cannot turn up anything and
there is nothing listed under that in Yokoyama's Index.

Yokoyama's Index gives a number of examples where it forms part of compounds
equivalent to "vandana"

Having translated from Chinese / Tibetan the Paryaya-samgrahani, the
Vivarana-samgrahani and now in process of the Vastu-samgrahani, I have
concluded that either the scribal quality of Xuanzang's YBS left something
to be desired -- there are many misreadings which can be attributed to
scibal confusion or the limited abilties of Xuanzang's team to read Indic
script.  There are also many cases were the translators have completely
misunderstood the meaning and syntax of the underlying Sanskrit as can be
established by the Tibetan text (not so hot either in terms of translation
quality) and canonical Pali / Sanskrit parallels.  I do not know if this
applies to the earlier portions of the YBS as I have not yet scrutinized
them in fine detail.

Whatever the original term may have been, I think you must be right about
the loss of understanding.
