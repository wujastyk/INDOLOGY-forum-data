Clay Cart
Dear Colleagues,
If this is not too frivolous a notice, last night BBC Radio 3
broadcast the Clay Cart:
Drama on 3
22 August 2004
The Mrichhakatikaa: A 5th-century Sanskrit play recorded on location
in India, the story of a romance between an impoverished nobleman and
a beautiful courtesan.
Duration:
1 hour 45 minutes
For one week you will be able to listen `again'
(by following the link at http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/dramaon3/)
It sounds like you have to listen to 10 minutes of the previous
programme (a John Adams Proms premi?re) before the play begins.
Yours truly,
Isabelle Onians
