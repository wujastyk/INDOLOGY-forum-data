Help with transliteration of zatapathabrAhmaNa
I do not know which edition you are using, but it doesn't seem to be 
the standard one by Weber:
Weber, Albrecht
1855    The ?atapatha-Braahma.na in the Maadhyandina-?aakhaa. Berlin & 
London [reprint Varanasi 1964, no doubt several other reprints too].
The curved strokes have to be your edition's rendering of this text's 
accent marks. Transliterating the  ;Satapathabraahma.na correctly, 
especially its accentuation system, is difficult, so be warned.
        An introduction:
O. B?htlingk, Sanskrit Chresthomathie, notes to his selection from the 
(p. 395f. of the 3rd ed. by Garbe, Leipzig 1909).
        Gory details (besides references in B?htlingk):
George Cardona, The bhaa.sika accentuation system, Studien zur 
Indologie und Iranistik 18 [1993], 1--40.
Karl Hoffmann, Aufs?tze zur Indoiranistik I, p. 132
Willem Caland, introduction to his edition of the Kaa.nva recension 
[Reprint Delhi 1983], chapter III, ?1 p. 30f.
