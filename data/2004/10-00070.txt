Ken,

Pratiruupa (?form?thing on the other side? cp. Pratibimba, pratika;ncuka)
and pratilipi have the sense of ?copy.? pratiruupita is the past passive
participle of the denominative root pratiruupay. The expression, therefore,
probably means, ?copying time, the date on which the copy was completed.?
Could it be that one digit is missing in ?i05??
