The situation is more complicated than this.  The Ganges and Indus
river dolphins (Platanista gangetica and Platanista minor) have long
snouts remarkably like that of the gharial, and in profile at a
distance are easily confused with it.  (And I imagine you wouldn't be
very inclined to swim up for a closer look....)  I have seen photos
illustrating this in a book on Whales and Dolphins, and it seemed to
explain a lot about the apparent combined crocodile/dolphin character
of the makara.
