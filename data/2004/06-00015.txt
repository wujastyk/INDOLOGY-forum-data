What does 'arham' mean?
McComas,
It's a sort of Jaina mulamantra. I'm pretty sure I've seen it discussed in
Hemacandra's Yogasastra (when proofreading the manuscript of Olle
Qvarnstr?m's translation), but couldn't find it just now. In any case, I am
sure there are many people on this list who can tell you more; Jainism
isn't really my field at all.
