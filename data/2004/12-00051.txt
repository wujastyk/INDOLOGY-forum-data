Science Mag: "no Indus script"
With regard to writing paraphernalia, I should have mentioned Richard
Salomon's *Indian Epigraphy*, pp.126ff.: a nice survey of the range of
materials on which Indic inscriptions have been found.
Farmer, Sproat & Witzel of course duly cite this source.
Best again to all,
George
