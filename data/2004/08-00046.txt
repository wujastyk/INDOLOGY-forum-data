Hello Stephen,

Here are the RV passages:

1.163.11: this is one of the hymns to the sacrificial horse: your citta
fleeting like the wind.
1.170.1: Agastya asserts that life is uncertain; if another's citta is to be
followed one's own intention is lost.
5.7.9: Agni is asked to place citta into his mortal devotees.
10.128.6: may the citta of one's awakened enemies be destroyed
10.166.4: [a spell to kill a rival]I take from you your citta, your vrata &
your community.
10.191.3: [last hymn of the RV, to harmony] may the mantra be united, the
community united, united the manas and united also the citta.

Hope that helps,

George Thompson

I wonder if anybody could tell me of any early attested occurences of the
word "citta" (mind etc) in early upanishadic or vedic texts -- in other
words, any probable pre-Buddhist occurences.  I ask because I do not have
access at present to indexes or searchable texts.  Many thanks.
