Science Mag: "no Indus script"
I wonder if the zi.s.tas would care to comment on what has always
seemed to me a classic case of circular reasoning: the IVC looks
like, and should be understood at least in part as, a precursor to
later Indian developments (e.g., in the cases of Ziva, ritual
bathing, status of certain animals), but primarily so seen in light
of those later developments--thus one proves the other. Is there a
way to de-link the IVC objects/evidence from their retrospective
reconstructions, and still establish some continuity with later
Indian facts?
