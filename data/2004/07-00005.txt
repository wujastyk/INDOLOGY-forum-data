The Manasollasa has indeed a chapter called syenavinoda - the exact
reference is Man. IV.13 (slokas 1329-1380) -found on p. 267-271 in Vol. 2 of
the Shrigondekar edition, Gaekwad Oriental Series 84, Baroda 1939.

P.S. Sorry about the lack of diacritic signs - I can't stand the "e-mail"
transliteration.
