Request for Ulrich Stiehl's fonts not to be used
Dear Dominik,
could you elaborate?
I have downloaded the Sanskrit 2003 font from Omkarananda Ashram's homepage, 
where no restriction of any kind was hinted at, and no special prerogatives 
of Ulrich Stiehl were stated.
But I am also interested in the morale of the thing -- is being on this list 
somewhat similar to being a black gay woman?
Yours,
Ferenc
