Intro to Malayalam?
Dear George,
I suggest she look at Rodney Moag's Malayalam grammar/introductory course.
It's a two-volume course (covering two semesters) and covers virtually all
aspects of the language. There are also cassettes which she can purchase.
She should write directly to Rodney (Uof Texas/Austin) for the details. I
found the book very good and highly recommend it!
All the best,
John
