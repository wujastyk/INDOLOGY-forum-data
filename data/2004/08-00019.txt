Subject: Nandinagari : help with ms
Message-ID: <161227074784.23782.16037949690964757269.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Is there anyone who would be willing to help the Library of Congress
catalog a Nandinagari manuscript if sent digital images of the whole
thing, or printouts thereof?  The information needed is what would be in
a standard catalog of Sanskrit manuscripts, which the book catalogers
here would use to create an online MARC format record.  Also, the
catalogers and I have developed a worksheet for non-cataloger experts.

I have no idea what the subject matter is.  It would be fun to do it
myself but I haven't the time.
