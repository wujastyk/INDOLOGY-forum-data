Subject: preservation of Kashmiri papier mache'
Message-ID: <161227074865.23782.17476384967237301215.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I have been clearing up my mother's condominium prior to sale, she
having moved to assisted living, and have got a very fine Kashmiri
papier mache' tray purchased in 1979.  Unfortunately, in several spots
the lacquer has blistered away from the underlying papier mache for some
reason (this has not happened to those I got from the same manufacturer
at the same time).  Does anyone know anyone with expertise in correcting
this syndrome?

Any leads much appreciated.
