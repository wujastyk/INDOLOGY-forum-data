The integrity of this INDOLOGY list (was: Re: fixed              link--Stcherbatsky and Indology sub-domains)
The phrase "out of India" has occurred only about 100 times in the
INDOLOGY discussion in the last ten years, and not at all in the last
three years, ...  until Plamen himself used the expression.
I can understand and sympathise with Plamen's criticism of the many
intemperate online discussions about Indian history and culture.  But this
INDOLOGY list has worked hard specifically on this issue - which became a
serious problem in the mid- to late 1990s, and led to the temporary
closing of the list.  I believe the new INDOLOGY, under the guidance of
its managing committee, has been successful in providing a safe forum for
the informed and reasonable discussion of Indology, without being too
dogmatic either.
I am sure that several of our members are also interested in Buddhist
logic.
Please note that Plamen has hired the web address
   http://www.indology.net
This has no connection with the present list, nor with my
INDOLOGY website, which is at

or

Sincerely,
Dominik Wujastyk
INDOLOGY list committee member
