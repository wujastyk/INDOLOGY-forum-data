Rzyazrnga
 Dear Martin Fosse,
I remember a couple of (not recent though) articles by L?ders. One is in his
Philologica Indica, the other was in another Festschrift published by
Mouton. I have forgotten precisely for whom, but I think it might have been
for Kuiper.
Best wishes

Rzyazrnga
Dear members of the list,
I am looking for recent articles/studies on RzyazRGga/EkazRGga (the
unicorn)
in Sanskrit literature. Any references would be most welcome.
Best regards,
Lars Martin Fosse
