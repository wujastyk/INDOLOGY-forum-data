SV: Devanagari
Stefan Baums pointed me to the list in this publication:
   http://www.sanskritweb.de/itmanual2003.pdf
It has been written by Ulrich Stiehl. The list runs from p. 28. 
But it would of course be wonderful if the ligatures and everything you ever
wanted to know about Devanagari but were afraid to ask, were available on a
web page.
