SV: attack on Professor S. Bahulkar

This development does not surprise me at all! I have expected this kind
of thing for a long time. Scholars have to consider the fact that
various "conservative" religious forces now actively target academia -
and not only Hindutvavadins. Scholars now have to give some thought to
how they are to handle threats, harassment, and possibly even
assassination attempts. (Letter bombs targeting Italian EU politicians
are popular in Europe right now, and why not send that sort of thing to
an academic you don't like?)
This is perfectly correct. But at the more immediate level, it is a
matter of personal security for scholars, who may have to come up with
solutions that enable them to work freely in a hostile and insecure
environment. There will not only be threats from the street, but
possibly also problems with political authorities who have to cater to
voters who may hold "anti-academic" views. I don't fear this problem for
Scandinavia, but it may become a real issue in other places.
