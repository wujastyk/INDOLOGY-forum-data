Science Mag: "no Indus script"
The ones you mention: Ziva, ritual bathing, status of certain animals,

that can be considered as native to South India as opposed to either
part of the larger Mesopotamian-South-Central Asian axis or simply
universal. This is the problem with the attempts to postulate a Harappan
origin of the Brahmi script: the letters that are similar between them

way, Mother Goddesses and 'hero' motifs are common throughout the entire
region.
