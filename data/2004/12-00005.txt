looking?
Dear Prof. Horacio,
Please, check the following websites:
<http://www.emory.edu/EDUCATION/mfp/james.html#varieties>
<http://www.bytrent.demon.co.uk/index.html>
There is some information there about William James (Varieties of religious 
experiences) and Rudolf Otto (Idea of the Holy)
I hope it helps.
