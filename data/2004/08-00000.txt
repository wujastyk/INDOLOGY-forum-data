I would like to thank the list members who have responded to my request for
information on introductory texts on Malayalam.  I have forwarded your
messages, and the recipient is delighted and grateful to have received them.
She promises to visit the University of Kerala and perhaps she will be able
to study there.

Best wishes,

George Thompson
