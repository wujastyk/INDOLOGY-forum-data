I haven't much to add to Stefan's summary except to note that I've
found multi-page TIFF files especially useful. These days I tend to
spend more time in front of scanners than photocopiers.
The following links give general information.
 i.) LibTIFF - TIFF Library and Utilities :
  http://www.libtiff.org/
 ii.) TIFF Tools Overview :
  http://www.libtiff.org/tools.html
N.B. in addition to the tools detailed above, recent versions of
libtiff (tiff-v3.6.1 on my beast) contain `tiff2pdf'. This can convert
a multi-page TIFF file into a PDF file.
For viewing TIFF images you could use :
 i.) viewfax
  http://gd.tuwien.ac.at/linuxcommand.org/man_pages/viewfax1.html
 ii.) XnView
  http://www.xnview.com/
For manipulating TIFF images -- and a number of other formats -- you
could try the VIPS and NIP image processing system :
