A colleague has asked for help in finding secondary sources that deal with
the Pune Sanskritists of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century
and how their scholarship, ideology, and overall orientation was viewed as
different from what was found in other places such as Benares or Calcutta.

The Pune Sanskritists have, for example, been referred to as "scientific"
or as "instrumental rationalists."  Where might one read about such
characterizations?

Thanks,
Gary Tubb.
