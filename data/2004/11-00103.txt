The usual way to install fonts in the Mac is to find the Users folder
on the hard disk, open your user home (a silly little house icon for
home) it will have your user name on (mine is jhunting). open that
and go to library. from there go to the fonts folder -- Drag copy the
fonts you want to use to that folder.

If you have Administrator access to your machine. You can do it the
following way which is preferable. On the main hard disk first level
open the Library folder, go to Library  and drag copy the font to the
fonts folder in there.

The newer versions of OS 10 allow this latter method freely however
some of the older versions are limited in access by the  Unix OS
