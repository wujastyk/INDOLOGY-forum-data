Dar Prof.Griffiths,
Thank you for your query. I am sorry for this delayed reply as I was away from Mexico. Vasudeva"s Goipalaarcanapaddhati edited by Gayacarana Tripathi deals with daily puja ceremony in Jagannatha Temple and Lak.smii Naatha Bha.t.ta"s Gopaalaarcanacandrikaa deals with Krishnite rituals to be practised daily three times by a devotee, excellent 36 verses of meditation, rituals of Purascarana, parctice of Yoga and easy method to awake Kundalinii.This is a 17th century text edited for the first time. It is most popular in Nimbarka tradition and  the results are immediate and wonderful.

Dear Dr. Joshi,

Thank you for this announcement. Could you please indicate --- for
those who are, like me, uninitiated in this field of literature --- in
what relation, if any, Lak.smii Naatha Bha.t.ta's text stands to
Vaasudeva's Gopaalaarcanapaddhati, published recently by Gaya Charan
Tripathi in his book

Communication with God.
The Daily Puujaa Ceremony in the Jagannaatha Temple.

IGNCA / Aryan Books International (New Delhi), 2004.
