Women
Not Sanskrit, but chapter 4 "Nayaka Anthropology" in Symbols of Substance:
Court and State in Nayaka Period Tamilnadu, by Rao, Shulman and
Subrahmanyam, explores some Telugu and Tamil narrative texts which
privilege the feminine voice (a recognized feature of S. India bhakti
poets), and - most interestingly - discusses the expression of
internalized thought and feeling in the female characters of these
narratives.
