A friend of mine send these questions to me.  If you have any
suggestions, let me know.  I don't know the answers.

1. This is trick sloka I heard (from one of my grandparents) when
I was a child:
? kumaarasambhavaM Srutvaa raghuvamSe manohare
? raakshasaanaam kulSreshTo ramo rajeevalocana:
What is the trick here? All I vaguely remember is that it has to
do with breaking the first word as kum+aara+sambhavam.
2. In Narayaneeyam:42:11 the word "lambhitamangalaaSisha:"
seems to
trouble most commentators. However, I am unable to follow their
analysis. What is the trouble here?
