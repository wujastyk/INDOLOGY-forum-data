Devanagari
I believe it was Stiehl himself who made the font for the Ashram.
Linux comes with input support for Gujarati, Gurmukhi, ?Hindi?
(i.e., Devanagari), Kannada, Oriya, Tamil and Telugu.  If you use
KDE or Gnome as your desktop environment, you can just add any of
these input methods to your keyboard switcher applet.  I had a
closer look at ?Hindi?/Devanagari, and the layout seems to be the
same as the one Microsoft uses, referred to by Andrew.  They both
go back to an Indian standard and implement a phonetic layout,
where the dentals are in one corner of the keyboard, the labials
in another, then you get the corresponding aspirates by pressing
Shift, etc.  So quite systematic really, but I guess it does take
some getting used to.
