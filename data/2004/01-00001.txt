Mahabharata translation
Dear members of the list,
I have seen an announcement of the publication of volume 7 of the great
Mahabharata translation (the continuation of van Buitenen's work).
However, I have not been able to find any reference to volume 6. Has
volume 6 appeared, or will it appear some time in the future?
Best regards,
Lars Martin Fosse
