stock phrase about men?
Just an after-thought on what I wrote here:
It occurs to me that in the context of these eight means of binding men, the
sudden mention of a rather sexually explicit item seems a bit out of
context, a rather sudden "gear-change" as it were, Richard Mahoney's
collection of passages nonwithstanding.
All things considered, I would rank the suggested possible interpretations
regarding the ultimate underlying / original meaning in my order of
preference as follows:
1.    Love-tokens in the form of flowers and fruit
2.    Joshing banter
3.    Open-spread vagina
Best wishes,
