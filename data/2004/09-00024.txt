Dear members of the list,

I am looking for information concerning (illicit) trade with manuscripts /
cultural objects related to Afghanistan and South Asia, as well as
information on what is being done to preserve such manuscripts and objects
locally. I would preferably like references to Internet sites, but any
information would be appreciated.

Best regards,

Lars Martin Fosse
