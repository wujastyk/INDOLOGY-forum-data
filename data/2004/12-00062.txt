Indological libraries and teh tsunami
Quoting  Palaniappa at AOL.COM:
I was also afraid of such a situation since IFP library in pondy will be the first to be hit in such a case. Fortunately there is no such horrible effect on the city of pondy. I called a freind yesterday for this.

Does anyone know if the tsunami that struck<br>the coastal areas of Andhra,
Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry caused any<br>damage to the manuscript libraries in
Chennai and Pondicherry. For<br>instance, if my memory is correct, the U.V.S library is
not very far<br>from the sea and a low-rise building at that.
Thanks.
