Ayurveda and the planets
In detailing the characteristics of the seven planets, Sanskrit
astrological texts typically assign an Ayurvedic constitution (prak.rti) to
each, although disagreeing among themselves on the precise scheme. I am
curious to know whether classical works on Ayurveda also link the various
do.sa combinations with the planets. Does anyone know?
Thanks in advance,
