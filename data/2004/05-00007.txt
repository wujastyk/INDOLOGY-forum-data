the Sanskrit for Hand held attribute
Dear John,
as your question indicates that you are not yet familiar 
with Gudrun B?hnemann's recently published standard 
works on iconography, I cannot resist to refer you to this 
source of sheer delight for an indological iconologist:
(omitting the diacritics)
Gudrun B?hnemann
The Iconography of Hindu Tantric Deities
Volume I:
The Pantheon of the Mantramahodadhi
Volume II:
The Pantheons of the Prapancasara and the Saradatilaka
Groningen [Egbert Forsten]
2000 & 2001
Given the heavy interchanges/mutual dependencies of 
Hindu and Buddhist Tantric iconographic features (as 
demonstrated e.g. by Sanderson and B?hnemann herself), 
also someone specialized in the Buddhist Tantric field will 
surely profit from these volumes. Confirming Robert Goldman's 
present reference to the term Ayudha-, B?hnemann, en passant, 
speaks of "iconographic attributes (Ayudha)" (e.g. II: 150), while 
clarifying the range of this notion as follows:
"The deities in the MM [= Mantramahodadhi] are described as 
holding a variety of iconographic attributes, called "weapons" (Ayudha). 
Besides actual weapons, Ayudhas include objects such as vessels, 
manuscripts, flowers and animals. All of the attributes are listed in 
appendix 1, section 5.4 of this book." (I: 49)

Best wishes,
Hartmut
