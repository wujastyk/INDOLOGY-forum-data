Question about writing Sanskrit without breaks between words
Dear Madhav Deshpande,
in the classical times -- and that is most probably still at the time
of the Ashokan inscriptions -- the Greek script consisted of only
capital letters, and the texts were written without breaks between
words and sentences. Thus the reader was not immediately able to
recognize textual units, but had to read very slowly (and the practice
was to do so with a loud voice). Best,
Hartmut Buescher
