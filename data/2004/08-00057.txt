         Sanskrit "Shriimad bhaagavatam" in elekronic form
Dear Humanist colleagues, we'd like to add Sanskrit to our collection of
our data of 157 world languages. We'd like to compare our data on the
phonemic frequency of these 157 world languages to Sanskrit. We have
noticed that more often than not, it is easier to feed some text in the
computer rather than to find it elsewhere. This time we'd like to feed in
the computer the First Song of the Sanskrit "Shriimad bhaagavatam". The
long vowels will be shown as two vowels. What can you advise us? Will it be
easier to feed the Sanskrit text or will it be easier to find it in the
electronic form? Looking forward to hearing from you soon to
