stock phrase about men?

What would be the motive for such a later addition ? Are you
postulating a growing tendency towards gender equality in the
developing Theravaada ?
I have the impression that the source for the Chinese translation of
the Ekottaraagama is rather late, but others may be better informed
on that.
If there were originally two suttas, I do not find it surprising that
sometimes only the one referring to the effect of women on men is
cited in later sources. If there was originally only one, the
decision to add a second discourse presenting the effect of men on
women would certainly be most interesting and would need to be
accounted for.
It should be noted that groups of small suttas each presenting a
slightly different angle on matters are quite common in the
A'nguttara.
I don't think anybody has suggested that. But to ignore the
commentaries is not very sensible, especially in a case like this. It
is clear that we are not dealing with a single isolated comment but
rather with a established tradition of exegesis in the Vinaya
commentaries. Most probably what we have here is the reason given by
the Theravaada tradition or its sources for the interpretation of
Middle Indian *va.nabha'nga as equivalent to Sanskrit vana-.
But the fact that this is clearly the traditional interpretation in
the Pali sources does not prove that it is the original meaning of
the 'canonical' passage (which may well have had variations both in
form and in interpretation from an early date).
