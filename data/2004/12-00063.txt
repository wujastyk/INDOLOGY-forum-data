Tsunami and Solempattai, Tamil Nadu
A member of the public has asked for help in locating a Catholic
orphanage in Tamil Nadu where she sponsors a boy.  She is very concerned
to know if he has been injured or killed by the tsunami.  The orphanage
is supposedly in Solempattai, TN, but she sends her donations and
letters to Angelo Project, Sacred Heart Foundation, with an address in
St. Thomas Mount, Chennai.  She is not sure whether the orphanage is
there or the letters are forwarded to someplace else in the state.  I
have been unable to find any town or village named Solempattai in the
sources available to me.  She is sure about the spelling.  The American
foundation that makes the connection between orphans and individual
sponsors is still closed for the Christmas holiday.  Does anyone know
anything about Solempattai, Tamil Nadu?  Is it a neighborhood in
Mylapore or elsewhere in Chennai?
I have already checked the Indian Christian Directory with no success,
searched on every search engine, sent an email to the Archbishop of
Madras, etc.
I'd be most grateful for any help.  Please feel free to forward as
appropriate.
Thanks,
