The artistic evidence regarding the term Makara:

As represented in art,  the makara is a complex composite creature
with representations from as early as the Mauryan period at the ca.
250 B.C.E. Lomas Rishi cave through to the present day. It is clearly
not a crocodile an any stage of its representations that I am
familiar with. At Lomas Rishi the representation is quite elaphantine
and is four legged but a comparison with one of the elephants in the
same frieze clearly demonstrates it is not an elephant.

In the Sanchi stupa two railing the makara is one of a series of
"auspicious"  designs ( I am not at all certain if the term mangalam
would be appropriate for them however). Makara occur several time in
a variety of of configurations, again always as a composite of
several creatures. Again it is fairly elephantine but this time with
a fish tail in place of hind legs.
