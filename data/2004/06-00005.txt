Visnu & Charumati bricks
Which reminds me of your recent announcement about the Chabhel brick
with writings in Asokan  Brahmi. Has it been published by now, and if
so, what is your website?

Dina and I have just heard from the Department of Archaeology that
he two bricks from the Chaurmati Stupa were given
thermo-luminescence tests in Europe.
1) The Bhrami only brick tests to approximately third century B.C.E.
(i.e. Mauryan)
2) The Brick with the copy of the Brahmi and the Bhujimo  incised
inscription itests to 12th century.
We will have the test in a few days and will then put the photographs
of the brick(s) up on the web.
