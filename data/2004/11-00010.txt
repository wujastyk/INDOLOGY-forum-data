SV: History of Sanskrit studies
I would like to thank all of you who have sent me bibliographical info on
this subject. I am quite overwhelmed! An incredible response. 
I should perhaps explain why: The university of Oslo has somewhat
high-handedly introduced a course on "research methods in Asian studies".
This apparently includes everything from Sanskrit to Hindi in addition to
everything else. I have proposed a course for Sanskritists more in line with
what they actually need, and a history of the subject would be very useful.
With this information, I can at a later date more easily build a course that
is meaningful to people working with the early period. I may get a chance to
do this next year because I am likely to be half-time lecturer for sanskrit
for a period, since there is a vacancy in Indology right now, and no money
to fill it. My job will be to keep the boat floating, if not to sail the
oceans.
Best regards,
Lars Martin
