A small point of information pertaining to the discussion between George
and Ferenc.

Although it is true there are significant remains of religious objects
and cemeteries in the IVC they are rather scanty when one considers that
the civilization lasted for over 700 years. The common explanation is
much of the remains were made of perishable materials that have not
lasted over the millennia -- this could also be relevant to the script.

Regarding burial practices there is some evidence indicating both
cremation and fractional burials which would, once again, reflect
practices in South and Central Asia respectively which is to be expected
since the IVC was a transition zone between these two regions.
