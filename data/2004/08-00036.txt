Clay Cart
I found it quite enjoyable, but it had been heavily edited.  I
haven't got a text at hand to check the details, but not only was
Caarudatta's wife written out of it, but there was no mention of the
little boy and the eponymous clay cart!  Perhaps the editors thought
that modern listeners would not be able to sympathize with a
polygamous relationship?
