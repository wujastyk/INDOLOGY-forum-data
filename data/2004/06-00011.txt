ANNOUNCEMENT OF TEMPORARY REPLACEMENT POSITION IN
SOUTH ASIAN LITERARY AND/OR CULTURAL STUDIES
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN

FOR WINTER TERM, JANUARY 1 - APRIL 30, 2005

Applications are invited from scholars of all ranks, from advanced graduate
students to full professors, for a one term position to teach South Asian
Literary and/or Cultural Studies in order to replace a colleague
temporarily on leave. Two courses are to be taught, using material written
in or translated into English. The first should be a broad, introductory
level course to undergraduates with little or no preparation in Asian
Studies; the second should be an upper-level undergraduate course with an
engaging thematic focus (that may coordinate with the candidate's research
interests.) The ideal candidate does research involving at least one
contemporary South Asian language. The Ph.D. is preferred, but a Ph.D.
candidate who has made significant progress towards completion of the
dissertation would also be considered. Salary will be commensurate with
experience. Send cover letter, CV, proposed course descriptions and three
letters of reference to:
