For method, de Jong could be supplemented with:

    JIABS 18(2) Winter 1995

    Seyfort Ruegg, Some reflections on the place of philosophy in the
    study of Buddhism, pp. 145ff.

    Gomez, Unspoken paradigms: meanderings through the metaphors of a
    field, pp. 183ff.

    Cabezon, Buddhist Studies as a discipline and the role of theory,
    pp. 231ff.

    Tillemans, Remarks on philology, pp. 279ff.

    Hubbard, Upping the ante: budstud at millenium.end.edu, pp. 309ff.


On interpretation and translation see:

    P. J. Griffiths. Buddhist hybrid english: Some notes on philology
    and hermeneutics for buddhologists. Journal of the International
    Association of Buddhist Studies (Madison, Wisconsin), 4:2:7-32,
    1981.


For a case study of various approaches to one author:

    Tuck, A. P., Isogenesis: Western Readings of N?g?rjuna & the
    Philosophy of Scholarship, Ph.D. thesis, Princeton University
    (1987).

    -, Comparative Philosophy and the Philosophy of Scholarship: On
    the Western Interpretation of N?g?rjuna (New York & Oxford: Oxford
    University Press, 1990).


And finally, on the consequences of an `insufficient philological
outfit' -- all too common it seems -- see an early note in:

    C. Lindtner. Nagarjuniana: Studies in the Writings and Philosophy of
    N?g?rjuna (Copenhagen: Akademisk Forlag, 1982)



Best regards,
