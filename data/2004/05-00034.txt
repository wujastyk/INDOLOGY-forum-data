Sannysa ?
Dearest Professors:
Namaste:
I am looked for sources from the vasinava tradition or in other sampradayas, if is there
specific statement in its sastras, that a sannyasi who has fallen into sense
gratification (nor sex, but romantic contac with a women) and then recitified his position, should formally give up the sannyasa ashrama? Or if him (sannyasi) can be reinstalled in his sannyasi order? Could you send me some references on this respect?
