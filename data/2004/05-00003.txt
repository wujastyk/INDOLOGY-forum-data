>Born in 1929 in a village in Rajasthan, Komal Kothari distinguished himself
>as a folklorist not only in the country but all over the world. For more
>than 50 years he researched and documented the performing arts of the region
>making notable contributions to studies in many areas of folklore in
>particular to study of musical instruments, regional oral traditions and
>puppetry. A pioneer in many areas of folklore, he founded the Rupayan
>Sansthan in early sixties.

>scholars from all over the world. He was Indian representative at many
>international fora for study of ethnomusicology. He was published widely and
>has instrumental in the production of a definitive series of gramophone
>records, cassettes, compact discs and a number of documentaries on
>Rajasthani folklore. He received several national and international awards
>including Padamshri and Padam Bhushan, the highest civilian award bestowed
>by the President of India.

>Kothari had been in different health for several years and he was
>hospitalised for the last 3 months. He passed away peacefully in midst of
>his family members. Kothari headed a big joint family and is survived by his
>wife Smt. Indira, two sons- Prashant and Kuldeep, and three daughters Uttra,
>Chitra and Mitra. His funeral was largely attended and was given state
>honour.

>In his last days, Kothari was deeply involved in his dream project of
>setting up a unique ethnographic museum for which the state government has
>donated a large peace of land at Arana Jharna, Mocalawas - a picturesque
>outer Jodhpur city. The museum of his dream aims at to have objects of daily
>use rather than those of historic or exotic significance. The museum will
>relate the story of the creative ingenuity of the common folk by tracing the
>history of tangible cultural objects and role they played in their daily
>life.
