Red ochre
Pace Prof. Witzel, my message was not
an exercise in "facile" comparison, but
a response to Dean Anderson's query:
"Has anyone seen any discussion of red ochre in this wider context or
what it might have symbolized?"
I of course made no assertion that either the Chinese and Tibetan
data, or the use of sinduura in Buddhist tantric contexts has
any interesting connection whatever with IVC. This, however, should
not stop anyone from pondering whether or not there seems
to be a coherent symbolic nexus to be found here.
