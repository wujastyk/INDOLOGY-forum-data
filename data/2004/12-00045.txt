The Indopedia project
As promised, the universal scholarly communication and content
management system has been set up for holiday experiments.
http://www.indopedia.org
Any page is open for editing, the major task being the categorial
framework. Every change is documented in a separate version of the
article changed. So everyone is invited to change and add whatever
deemed necessary.
The base code is Western European, but in the end of the testing period
it will be changed to UTF-8 to allow for full-fledged diacritics,
Devanagari, and other Indic and Eastern scripts.
Why Wikipedia fork? Because there is not even an article on Indology in
the Wikipedia, and because most of the terminological entries are not
appropriate there, being redirected to another open project called
Wiktionary. Which is clearly far away from the Indology.
If there is interest to this project, a special discussion  forum can be
set up.
Best regards,
