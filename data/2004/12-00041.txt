Subject: List committee: option NOMAIL for holiday/trip abroad/etc.
Message-ID: <161227075563.23782.3869620629982318461.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear Listmembers,

With the holiday season approaching,
I draw your attention to the possibility
to set your subscription to
NOMAIL, which means that you will not receive any

messages from the list.
Also practical if you go abroad for a while.
You are still actually a member, and
whenever you want to start getting messages again

you can yourself set mail
delivery to normal again.
The link to the subscription management page can
be found on the INDOLOGY website,
and I paste it here below as well (make sure that
that everything is on one line):

After logging in, see the option for NOMAIL under
Miscellaneous (bottom of the page).

With best season's greetings and best wishes for
the new year.

On behalf of the Committee,
J.H.
