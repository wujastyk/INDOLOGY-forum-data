Asokan inscriptions online?
Dear List,
I have been asked a question which I have not been able to answer.  Are
there any online resources for the study of the Asokan inscriptions?  The
question comes from one who would like to access not only the text and
translation of all of the inscriptions, but also, if possible, photographs
of the rock edicts themselves.
I have not been able to find anything.  Thanks in advance for any help.
