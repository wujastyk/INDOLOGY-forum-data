graaha/nakra/makara
Dear Friends
I wonder if any of you good folk could help me find a quotation that went
something like this:
`If you read the scriptures, you'd think India was about vaRnas; if you read
colonial censuses, you'd think it was about jAti; if you are an
anthropologist in a village, you'd think it was about brotherhoods.'
The word for brotherhood was a derivative of bhratR. I thought it might be
from McKim Marriott or Dumont, or possibly Inden, Pollock, Dirks...
With greetings and thanks in advance from a sweltering Canberra summer.

graaha/nakra/makara
Dear Colleagues,
Can anyone point me in the direction of more recent studies of any of these
three terms than Vogel's "Errors in Sanskrit Dictionaries" in BSOAS 20?  In
that he shows that _makara_ means a crocodile but has only passing reference
to the other two terms, which are usually thought also to mean the
crocodile.  What gives me cause for hesitation over this is that there occur
dvandva compounds of these terms, which to my mind indicates that, though
similar, they are not identical.  [Specifically, in the Ramayana, we find
_nakra_ and _makara_, and also _graaha_ and _nakra_, so linked, while I
detect indications that _graaha_ is a riverine animal but _mahaagraaha_ is
marine.]  Also, while I am about it, what is the Sanskrit term for the third
main crocodile species, the gharial/gavial?  Does anyone know of any
relevant literature?
Yours
