Dear Colleagues,
I should like to draw the attention of those of you, who possibly intend to participate in the German Oriental Conference (20-24 September 2004) in Halle (Germany), to the dead-line for registration, which has been set for May, 31. 
For more information, please see

Papers and Indological panels registered so far can be checked under
"Programm" / "Sektionen" / "Indologie und Suedasienkunde" / "Einzelreferate" and "Panels".
See, however, also the "Oriental Manuscripts" section under the header of "Faecheruebergreifende Panels".
