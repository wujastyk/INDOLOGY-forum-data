IVC... and ICMS

Dear Dean,
I am totally with you and would even propose to make several steps
further: Let us set up an Indological Content Management System (ICMS)
combining the features of multiple electronic journals, the TTF
versatility of published book, the dynamic nature of online discussions,
the Open Spirit of GFDL, and the comprehensive substance of an
encyclopedic dictionary and original text repository, all in one.
In short, I am thinking about customizing the best solution now
available at the CMS market, namely, the Wikipedia, and come up with a
special clone of the English Wikipedia (about 2 Gigs of data) in 24
hours for all of us to experiment.
Best Regards,
Plamen
