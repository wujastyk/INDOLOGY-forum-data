Dear Indology colleagues,

Does anyone know if the tsunami that struck the coastal areas of Andhra,
Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry caused any damage to the manuscript libraries in
Chennai and Pondicherry. For instance, if my memory is correct, the U.V.S library is
not very far from the sea and a low-rise building at that.

Thanks.

Regards
S. Palaniappan
