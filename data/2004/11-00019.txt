Indology in Poland
There are two Indology departments in Poland: in
Warsaw (Warsaw University) and in Krakow (Jagiellonian
University). Sanskrit is also tought in Wroclaw and,
perhaps, in Poznan. The information about the Indology
department of Krakow (Zaklad Indianistyki; website in
Polish) can be found at:
http://www.filg.uj.edu.pl/ifo/indianistyka.php
and of Warsaw (website in Polish and English) at:
http://www.orient.uw.edu.pl/index_pl.html
Hope it helps, at least as a start,
