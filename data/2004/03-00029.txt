CDIAL bajAgi from vajrAgni looks a bit oddly, one would expect bAjAgi (?)

vajrAgni to be found in the Mbh once:

08012052c drauNAyaniM cAbhyahanat pRSatkair; vajrAgnivaivasvatadaNDakalpaiH


Interestingly, Mbh. has also vaidyuta - agni:


01021009c tvam eva meghas tvaM vAyus tvam agnir vaidyuto 'mbare


12232018c vaidyuto 'gnir ivAkAze pazyaty AtmAnam AtmanA
