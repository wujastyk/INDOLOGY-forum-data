Inter-caste marriage
Dear members of the list,
I am looking for references to any pre-Islamic author of Indo-Aryan texts
advocating or encouraging inter-caste or inter-varna marriages. Any information
on the contexts in which this occurs will also be useful.
Thanks in advance.
Regards
S. Palaniappan
