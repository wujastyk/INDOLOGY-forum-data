stock phrase about women?
Ahem.  Could it possibly be referring to the love-bites and scratches
so popular in Indian love literature?  These are generally thought to
be endearing, and the sight of them the next morning makes the lovers
feel amorous again.  If this is not such a common idea in Tibetan
literature, this would explain the confusion over the translation.
Just a thought--
