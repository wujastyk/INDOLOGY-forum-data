Sanskrit query
Dear Colleagues:
Is anyone in the academy, in North America, teaching spoken Sanskrit
along with the more usual approach?  I'm very interested in developing
appropriate materials for the elementary level, but don't want to
reinvent the wheel if someone's already doing this.
Thank you,
