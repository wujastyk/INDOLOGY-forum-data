December last, Peter Scharf mentioned that he and a colleague were
working on producing `morphological generation and analysis software
for Sanskrit'. This software may be able to parse non-separated
Devanagari text and then convert it into separated Romanised text. You
might like to mail Scharf about the status of his project.
