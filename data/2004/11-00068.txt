I've always thought so.  Indologists are a bit like Mac users in that
respect: we think of ourselves as members of a persecuted minority :-)
But regarding Ulrich Stiehl's request, I can only refer you to him
directly.  He wrote to me as a member of the Indology list committee
asking that members of the list should not use his fonts, so I passed on
that message.  I do not wish to go further into the matter, really.
Best,
Dominik
