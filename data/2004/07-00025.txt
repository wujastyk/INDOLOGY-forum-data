Saw-scaled viper:

"LOCAL NAMES: Pushtu Phissi; Sindhi Kuppur, Janndi; Hindi Afai; Marathi
Phoorsa; Kannada Kallu havu; Tamil Viriyan pamboo, Surutai viriyan;
Malayalam Churuta; Gujarati Tarachha, Zeri padkoo udaneyn.

The striking posture is characteristic, a double coil in the form of a
figure of 8 with its head in the centre.  The coils keep moving against
each other and the serrated keels on the flank scales produce a hissing
noise by friction, amplified by the inflated body acting as a resonator.
There is a report of a pot ull of these snakes hissing under excitement
sounding like a boiling kettle.

FOOD: Feeds largely on centipedes, scorpions, larger insects, mice,
skinks, geckos and frogs."
