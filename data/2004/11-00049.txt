This discussion may be moving off-list but I am far from weary of
it. Especially as it holds the possibility of being so fruitful. A
correctly designed, cross platform, freely available, unicode
Devanagari font -- what a mouthful -- would I am sure be well received
and widely used.
While you are gathering details of what is currently available you
might like to assess the Devanagari fonts initially designed by Frans
Velthuis for Groningen and currently maintained by Anshuman Pandey
&c.:

These fonts are available as METAFONTs and as PostScript Type 1 font
programs in binary format (PFBs). I'm not sure if I've still got a set
in ASCII format (PFAs) on my beast, but if needed they are simple to
generate from the PFBs using Hetherington and Kohler's `t1utils':
 http://www.lcdf.org/~eddietwo/type/
Test pages for all the glyphs -- to see them up close -- can be
generated from PFAs or Bs with `t1testpage' (bundled in the same). Of
special note are the various of families, shapes and weights now
available (esp. as of Version 2.11, 16 August 2004).
With kind regards,
