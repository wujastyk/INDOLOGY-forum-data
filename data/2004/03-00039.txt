I won't go into further details, as Dominik is first of all looking for
a source of this verse, and not for a translation. Paolo's suggestion
doesn't convince me because it requires supplying a fair bit of unstated
information, and this seems unnecessary as more straightforward readings
are, I believe, possible, even without leaving the poor author with
"poor logic". One might also ask why the author should at this point
have to produce waterproof logic, for as far as I remember, the text in
question is an ironic treatise aiming to demolish the foundations of
medical science. It would therefore not be that surprising if one found
instances of sophistry in it, and this verse may be one of them (this
might even be relevant regarding possible sources, if this is indeed a
clear-cut quotation). But anyway, since it is rather pointless to
discuss this further without more context, I'll leave it at that and
humbly hope for a better syntax day tomorrow.
Best regards,
