What does 'arham' mean?
Dear Friends
The first chapter of PUrNabhadra's PaJcatantra opens with the words:
arham | auM namaH zrIsarasvatyai |
The other four chapters open with the single word
arham |
Can any of you good folk tell me what arham means in this context? Is it
commonly used in this way?
Many thanks in advance.
