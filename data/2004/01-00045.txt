Digital images of MSS -- VIPS and NIP
Dear Colleagues,
It may be timely to flag the availability of the following:
 VIPS, an image-processing library
 NIP, an interface (GUI) for VIPS
 http://www.vips.ecs.soton.ac.uk/index.php
This software would seem especially well suited for processing and
manipulating digital images of MSS.
Best regards,
 Richard Mahoney
