I don't think that there is any doubt about the value of this
collection. My only reservation is that all digital texts seem to be
available only in Adobe Acrobat format (PDF files):

This is a little disappointing. I would have preferred the texts to
have been available in the Tag(ged) Image File Format (TIFF files):

TIFF images of digital texts tend to be easy to manipulate using a
wide variety of applications.
So my question is whether any readers have been able to successfully
convert TBRC PDF files into TIFF files (preferably multi-page
files). I have experimented on my BSD machine with `pdftoppm' (from
XPDF bundle) followed by `ppm2tiff' (from libtiff bundle). This does
work, but it is slow and tedious. I can imagine that this route would
soon become a nightmare if one had a good number of TBRC PDF files to
convert.
I would very much appreciate any thoughts on this issue.
Best regards,
 RBM
