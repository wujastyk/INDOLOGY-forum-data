Richard,
I also used pdftoppm, but within a (equally slow and rather tedious)
process with different goals. Being mainly interested in bsTan-'gyur
data, I wanted to extract all individual folios from the pdf-files which
often contain many works, and then build a navigation model, in order to
find individual folios easier. This process can be partly automatised;
the rest would take some time, but I'm not in a hurry and am planning to
continue with this depending on the texts I'm reading. (I'm just doing
this for my own convenience but would be happy to share any usable
results with the TBRC or others.)
I also wanted to fit the entire bsTan-'gyur data on one CD, compressing
the images (jpg) as much as possible, with the main target being screen
legibility, not print. In this I didn't quite succeed, which may be due
to my own inexperience with image manipulation technology.
I haven't worked a lot with TIFF-data; could you perhaps spell out some
of the things one could do with these TIFF-files - apart from converting
them into other formats? OCR is the most obvious candidate, but is there
already reasonable software around for Tibetan blockprints?
Best regards,
Birgit Kellner
