email addresses on Indology
I obviously clicked on the wrong sneaky URLthat pops up first on google when
I type in the name of the one I use, then changes to Noadware when you get
there!
The one I use--Adaware-- is the following:
http://www.lavasoftusa.com/software/adaware/
This link on their homepage gets you to their free version:
http://www.lavasoftusa.com/support/download/
I regret my mistake folks--sorry. I know this one is good because I use it
and nothing has gone wrong with my WinXP system.
