sAtvatI/sAttvatI
Dear Indologists,
I have seen two variants, sAtvatI and sAttvatI, being used to refer to one of
the dramatic styles mentioned in the nATyazAstra. I would appreciate any
information about the current view among Sanskritists on what the correct form. I
would also appreciate any etymological information or references to
etymological discussion related to this term. Thanks in advance.
Regards
