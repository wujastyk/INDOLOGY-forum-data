Indology in Poland
Dear members of the list,
I have been trying to find out what sort of Indology/South Asian studies  is
being done in Poland, and where it is being done.
Are there any webpages that would be of any help?
Any Poles on the list that could be of assistance?
Best regards,
Lars Martin Fosse
