Buddhist Fundamentalism (was: Re: Indology.Info)
Fundamentalism and sectarianism are the two present-day Extremes in Buddhist Dharma between which a true madhyanta-vibhaga should be made. I can point to at least one site that in a most original way exemplifies both alternatives of the said koti.

BTW, from time to time I happen to moderate the Buddhist Philosophy forum at www.e-sangha.com, and the moderatorial team is much concerned about possibly evading the fate of the Tryke boards, closed because of too much dark-zen Buddhist sectarianism. They are also concerned about not too high-pitchingly voicing the "fight" against sectarianism, which may eventually be interpreted as Gelug-pa or other type of fundamentalism.
