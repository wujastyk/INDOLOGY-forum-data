Advanced Spoken Sanskrit course in Varanasi
Allow me to add a comment to P. Sadandanda Das's work. So far four of
my (ex)students here have completed at least one of his courses in
Heidelberg and - last year - in Florence, and have emerged beaming
from the experience. I thoroughly envy their capacity to hold real
conversations in Sanskrit on most anything and chant all the
classical meters in the traditional way. I'm sure the advanced course
will prove to be to their immense advantage. This kind of initiative
deserves the highest praise.
