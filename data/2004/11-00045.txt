Mac vs. PC (was: Re: Devanagari)
In case you don't already know it, there's a marvellous little book by
Neal Stephenson (of _Cryptonomicon_ fame) called _In the Beginning was the
Command Line_.  I was put on to this by Gary Tubb, and it remains one of
my favourite computing books.  It's very funny, and explores the whole
Mac/PC/Linux debate with great good cheer and insight.  (It was written
before the Mac world went Unix, with OS X.)
