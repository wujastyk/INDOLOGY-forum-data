Bagchee is a bit of a pain to say the least
If you have a filter in your settings for your e-mail you can make a
filter and never see another one. My filter is under "special" in the
menu bar but yours may be somewhere else in "Settings" or
"Preferences," I have found my filtering options very useful.
However Bagchee occasionally alerts me to a useful book that I then
buy from someone who is much cheaper.
