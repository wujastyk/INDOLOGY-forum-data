Re: tad yathA
Just a quick opinion: Though certainly common, the phrase appears to be
merely a literary device ("Once upon a time..."); certainly it does not have
the force of the Pali, "evam (iti) me sutam"
While texts like the pancatantra are in Sanskrit, their audience probably
was not brahmins deeply versed in scripture (who would then make the
connection to other scriptural texts...), but those who used Sanskrit for
its literary value.  Indeed, texts of this class were almost certainly
translated into Sanskrit from other Indic languages ("thus, it was
heard...")

  tad yathA
  Dear Friends
  May I ask for guidance again?
  After the invocation, PUrNabhadra's PaJcatantra opens with the phrase `tad
  yathAnuzrUyate'. `tad yathA' reminds me of the introduction to certain
  mantras. Can one argue that by beginning the text with these words, its
  creators are (consciously or unconsciously) using a scriptural formulation
  that lends the text a particular authority? Is this stretching the point?
  How common is `tad yathA' as an opening device in Sanskrit lit? Does it
add
  authoritative gravitas to the discourse, or it is just a textual device?
  Yours in gratitude
  McComas
