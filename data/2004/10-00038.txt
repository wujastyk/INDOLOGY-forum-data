What Ten Young Men Did
Dear Colleagues,
A small request for information.
Are you aware of any translation into any language of Da.n.din's
Da"sakumaaracarita that echoes the avoidance of labials in the
seventh ucchvaasa, "What Mantragupta Did"?
Thank you in advance for your kind attention.
Isabelle Onians
