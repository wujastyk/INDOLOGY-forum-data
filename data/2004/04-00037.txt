New Journal
        Asian Medicine - Tradition and Modernity
AMTAM is a multidisciplinary journal aimed at researchers and
practitioners of Asian medicine in Asia as well as in Western countries.
It makes available in one single publication academic essays that explore
the historical, anthropological, sociological and philological dimensions
of Asian medicine as well as practice reports from clinicians based in
Asia and in Western countries.
With the recent upsurge of interest in non-Western alternative approaches
to health care, AMTAM will be of relevance to those studying the
modifications and adaptations of traditional medical systems on their
journey to non-Asian settings. It will also be relevant to those who wish
to learn more about the traditional background and practice of Asian
medicine within its countries of origin. On account of its appeal to
scholars from a range of academic backgrounds (such as history,
anthropology, philology, sociology, archaeology) as well as to
practitioners based in Asia and in Western medical institutions and
alternative health care settings, the journal constitutes a unique
resource for both scholarly and clinically focused institutions.
Subscribe now! This is the first ever journal uniquely devoted to a
careful mix of practice and scholarship on Asian medicine and its success
is dependent on a co-operative endeavour between the Society and its
members.
The contents list of the first issue is in the flyer on
the website (downloadable PDF).
