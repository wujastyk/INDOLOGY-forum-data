Aw heck!
Pauline Kolenda wrote a lot about caste and varna--why not try to find her
via the office of the anthro dept at Univ. of Houston: carous at uh.edu
"Pauline Kolenda is Emerita Professor of Anthropology at the University of
Houston, Texas, USA"
 If you have not met her, she is a very nice woman, approachable.
