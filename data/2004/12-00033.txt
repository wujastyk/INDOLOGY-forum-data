Actually, there is a rather significant bar to ScholarlyServices it
seems. And opinions apparently vary about the amount of "intelligent"
discussion on the Indology list since most professional Indologists no
longer post there!

Perhaps there is a need for a list that straddles this one and
ScholarlyServices?
