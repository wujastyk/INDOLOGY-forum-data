Emeneau's 100th birthday
List members:
February 28th is the 100th birthday of the great Indologist Murray B.
Emeneau, which is being celebrated at a symposium in Berkeley CA on Feb.
20-21; see
http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~garrett/LanguageEcologyConference.pdf .
A contact address is given there, which, I suppose, can be used for sending
congratulatory messages.
May all Indologists live to be 100 in the future! ("jijiivis.ecchatam.
samaah.")
