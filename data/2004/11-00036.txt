Request for Ulrich Stiehl's fonts not to be used
Ulrich Stiehl has requested that the fonts he has created, e.g., Sanskrit
2003, Palladio fonts etc., should not be used by any members of the
INDOLOGY list.
I have also removed references to his website from the INDOLOGY website.
Please comply with Ulrich's wishes.
Best,
Dominik
