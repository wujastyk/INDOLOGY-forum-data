Dear Plamen,

According to the Cologne on-line dictionary, the oldest word  (RV)is perhaps
mastiSka
also classical (suSruta, sARGgadhara-saMhitA) are
mastu-luGga and mastu-luGgaka,
and the group
goda, gorda and gordha
is found only in dictionaries.
I don't recall having seen any of them in philosophical texts.

Yours,
Ferenc
