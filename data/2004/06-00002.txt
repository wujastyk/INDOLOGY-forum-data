Vi.s.nu's avataaras in Art
While the Dasha avatara are barely on my list of 
interests, my students,  Anu Vedagiri and Chaya 
Chandrasekhar, pass on the following:
The earliest known image set is the ca. third 
century Yelesveram (at Nagarjunakkonda) stele 
with fragments of the ten around him.
The base of the Gupta temple at Deogarh was 
"supposed" (see Vats) to have a dasha avatara, 
set around the base, but it was fragmentary and 
is presently stored in a seemingly "permanently" 
locked godown at the site.
The Rashtrakuta (ca 8th century) Cave fifteen at 
Ellora, is known as the Dasha avatara, but will 
have to check our photographs to see if there is 
a real set in it or not.
Complete sets of them show up in Pala sculpture 
in the ninth and tenth centuries.
Prior examples of several avatara are important 
individual images Varaha, Narasimha, Trivikram, 
Krishna, are all sixth century or earlier.
A 2nd or 3rd cemtury Narasimha has just been discovered in Andhra
If any one is interested a small web site could be put up in a few days
