Dear All,

Dina and I have just heard from the Department of Archaeology that
the two bricks from the Chaurmati Stupa were given
thermo-luminescence tests in Europe.

1) The Bhrami only brick tests to approximately third century B.C.E.
(i.e. Mauryan)

2) The Brick with the copy of the Brahmi and the Bhujimo  incised
inscription itests to 12th century.

We will have the test in a few days and will then put the photographs
of the brick(s) up on the web.

John Huntington (and Dina Bangdel)
