Advanced Spoken Sanskrit course in Varanasi
I am happy to let you know that next year the already 6th sixth
International Summer School in Spoken Sanskrit with Dr.Sadananda Das will be
organized at the South Asia Institute, Heidelberg University. Details will
follow in due time. For the history of this institution see:
http://www.sai.uni-heidelberg.de/abt/IND/index.html and then click "Sanskrit
Summer School".
Sadananda's work has been officially recognized by the fact that the
Language Teaching Programmes of the South Asia Institute has been awarded a
Regional Teaching Award ("Landeslehrpreis") from the Federal State
Baden-W?rttemberg. This enables us for the first time to announce
scholarships for interested students.
