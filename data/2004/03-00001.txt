I remembered that I think I have seen another interpretation of Makara
as a rasi, namely as a goat or maybe deer emerging from a snail shell.
The latter presumably is a development from those representations of the
makara in which  the marine-animal tail is tightly wound in a spiral.

Could the representations of the rasi also be influenced by Islamic
representations of it?
