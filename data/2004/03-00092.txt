Convert Devanagari into romanized text: any automatic tools?
Are you referring to the conversion of scanned text,
that is to say, a system of Devanagari optical character recognition?
The convention of writing Devangari with a bar linking the syllables
has posed an obstacle for software development in this area.
Perhaps some of the other list members are more up to date than
I in their knowledge of current progress to resolve this.
But if you are speaking of conversion of coded devanagari input,
unicode or otherwise, there should be no formal obstacle to
the creation of suitable conversion macros.
