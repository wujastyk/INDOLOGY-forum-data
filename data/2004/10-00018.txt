SV: Question about writing Sanskrit without breaks between words
For Greek inscriptions, see the following web site:

For ancient Virgil manuscripts, see this web site:

As you will see, it is hard to see a space between any of the words. The
same applies to ancient boustrophedon inscriptions. I can't vouch for
Aramaic, but writing a text without separating the words is not something
unique to Indic texts.
