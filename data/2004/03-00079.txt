Women
Dear members of the list,
On behalf of a student, I would like to ask you about Sanskrit texts
that portray women described as having knowledge and agency. Typically,
the courtesan fits this description, but the student would also like to
know if there are texts that describe more "mainstream" women in this
manner. Such women could for instance be aristocrats or religious
specialists. I would be grateful for any references/suggestions.
Best regards,
Lars Martin Fosse
