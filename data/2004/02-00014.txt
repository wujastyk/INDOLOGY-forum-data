Dear Colleagues,

There is now a website for the 13th World Sanskrit Conference to be held in
Edinburgh in July 2006, which contains basic details and will be updated and
expanded in due course as more details are decided and information becomes
available.  It is at <http://www.arts.ed.ac.uk/sanskrit/13thWSC> and it
includes a form for registration of interest.

Yours

John Brockington
