Last Thursday and Friday a popular uprising began in the Maldives,
protesting against the wrongful imprisonment of several leaders of the
Maldivian movement for democracy.

An indological colleague, Dr Leonid Kulikov (Leiden), is personally
acquainted with one of the imprisoned leaders of the democracy party, Dr
Mohamed Munavvar, who was allegedly robbed, beaten and arrested by
government forces on the president's personal orders on Friday afternoon.

Dr Kulikov has written a letter to President Gayoom, demanding the
immediate release of Dr Munavvar, whose arrest is a violation of
international human rights.

The letter can be read on the INDOLOGY website (http://indology.info) in
the "INDOLOGY members' queries and information" section (direct link:

Dr Kulikov has asked me to distribute his letter via this list, and
invites other concerned parties to join his protest.

Best,
Dominik
