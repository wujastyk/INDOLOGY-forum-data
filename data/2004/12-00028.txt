Subject: Hindi geographical names
Message-ID: <161227075530.23782.2198865132930430061.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear List Memebers:

My list is now considerably shorter. Many thanks to all who have already
helped.  My only Devanagari
map of India is too small (1: 4 500 000) to include every important
element. The GNS list does not show
retroflex consonants. Long vowels are represented, but not systematically.
If any of  Indian list members would
consult Devanagari maps of India they may have on hand (or - perhaps -
indexes to Hindi school atlases) ,
their help would be greatly appreciated. It quite might be that there are
somewhere on the Net electronic versions
of India maps in Devanagari script, with standardized Hindi versions
of  geographical names, but I am not
aware of it. Are there any? Survey of India maps are not yet freely
available on the Net:
