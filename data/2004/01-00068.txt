ADVANCED SUMMER SCHOOL IN SPOKEN SANSKRIT 2004
ADVANCED SUMMER SCHOOL IN SPOKEN SANSKRIT 2004
This year for the second time the South Asia Institute, University of
Heidelberg offers a three-week intensive course dedicated to advanced
learners of spoken Sanskrit. Shri Sadananda Das has prepared a course
which especially addresses the needs of the alumni of the previous
Heidelberger Sanskrit Summer Schools, but is equally open to those who
already speak Sanskrit. What has been learnt in previous courses will be
reactivated and the students will be assisted in enlarging their
vocabulary, practicing the use of idiomatic expressions as well as in
developing free speech and having topically oriented discussions. By
introducing new material from gnomic and kaavya literature one of the
foci once again will be memorization, recitation and, as a grand finale,
a theatrical performance.
