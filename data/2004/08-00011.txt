I think the Indologist in question might be Karoly (but he also called himself Charles) Ujfalvy (1842-1904), who wrote Les Aryons au nord et au sud de l'Hindou-Kouch, bublished in Paris 1896.

Someone has sent this query to me. Let me know if any of you has the
answer. It may be that the name is misspelt. Thanks.
