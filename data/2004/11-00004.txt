Louis Renou's *Les maitres de la philologie v?dique* [Annales du Mus?e
Guimet, xxxviii, 1927] should be added to Francois Obrist's useful list.

It is narrowly focused, of course, but it treats in detail the early
controversies in Vedic Studues that led to the establishment of good
philological method.

Extensive discussion of Bergaigne, Oldenberg, Geldner, Grassmann, Pischel,
Ludwig, et al. It is excellent, as one would expect of anything written by
Renou.

Best wishes,

George Thompson
