search for source of verses
With apologies for possible cross-posting -
Recently, while reading the Anubhavasuutra, a Virasaiva text from the
14th century, I came across the verse
yathaa kalaa tathaa bhaavo yathaa bhaavas tathaa mana.h
yathaa manas tathaa d.r.s.tir yathaa d.r.s.tis tathaa sthalam
to which a student of mine said that she had read something similar she
had learnt during a dance class and supposedly is foudn in Bharata's
Naa.tya;saastra:
yathaa hastas tathaa d.r.s.tir yathaa d.r.s.tir tathaa mana.h
yathaa manas tathaa bhaavo yathaa bhaavo tathaa rasa.h
In view of the similarity of these verses, we are wondering whether
both are derived from a still older verse. Does anyone have a
suggestion?
