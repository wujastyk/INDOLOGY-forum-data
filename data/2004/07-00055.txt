Dear Friends

I would recommend the following article: 

Mumme, Patricia Y., ?Haunted by Sankara?s Ghost; The Srivaisnava Interpretation 
of Bhagavad Gita 18:66,? in *Texts in Context* J.R. Timm Ed.,  (SUNY 1992) 69-
85.

While this article does not compare Sankara's and Ramanuja's reading of the 
Bhagavad Gita on all points, it does zero in on what seems to me to be the most 
important aspect: the moral implications. Sankara famously argues in his 
commentary on the Gita that even dharma can be an obstacle to moksa to the 
serious aspirant. And Gita 18:66 appears to confirm this (even though Krishna 
through out the whole book cannot stop emphasizing the importance of one's own 
dharma). Ramanuja famously resists this reading, and gives two ways of reading 
18:66 so as to avoid Sankara's gloss. 

It seems to me that this one issue is pivotal, for it reveals the vital 
difference between philosophical outlooks between the two thinkers. Sankara's 
anti realism is highlighted by his willingness to abandon dharma, while 
Ramanuja's staunch realism comes out in his refusal to treat dharma as 
something mutable. Naturally, the issue also touches on Sankara's and 
Ramanuja's conception of Brahman. For Sankara, Brahman is above most 
distinctions and qualities, while for Ramanuja, Brahman is the embodiment of 
moral and aesthetic perfections.  Thus, dharma cannot be absent in moksa for 
Ramanuja, though it is not to be found in Sankara?s Nirguna Brahman.

The article also highlights how the Southern school of Sri Vaisnavism appears 
to backtrack on Ramanuja?s argumentative gains. 

Best
Shyam
