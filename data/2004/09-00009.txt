Dear members of the list,

I have a question regarding a verse in the Rshyashringa episode of the
Mahabharata.

The verse runs:

nivartiteSu sasyeSu yasmai zAntAM dadau nRpaH 1

lomapAdo duhitaraM sAvitrIM savitA yathA || 003110051/3

I am curious about the reference to savitR and savitrI here. I can't
remember any myth, and I can't find any reference to such a myth, where
savitR gives savitrI as bride to somebody. Could anybody help me with the
reference?

Best regards,

Lars Martin Fosse
