Rsyashringa
Dear members of the list,
I have a question regarding a verse in the Rshyashringa episode of the
Mahabharata.
The verse runs:
nivartiteSu sasyeSu yasmai zAntAM dadau nRpaH 1
lomapAdo duhitaraM sAvitrIM savitA yathA || 003110051/3
I am curious about the reference to savitR and savitrI here. I can't
remember any myth, and I can't find any reference to such a myth, where
savitR gives savitrI as bride to somebody. Could anybody help me with the
reference?
Best regards,
Lars Martin Fosse
