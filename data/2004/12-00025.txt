Science Mag: "no Indus script"
Well, I don't care at all what the list managers decide to do about this
matter, although other list members may indeed care.
I myself am deeply involved in the discussions of the IVC sign system [not a
script at all as far as anyone can tell].  I do not rely on this list for
information on this issue.  It just occurs to me that list members who may
want to know more about this matter might be better informed by having
access to the actual debate.
But if no one on this list cares about this, well then, I will not disturb
your peace.
Best,

Re: Science Mag: "no Indus script"
Although I personally welcome spirited discussion on this list... given
the already contentious nature of the debate about the recent
Farmer-Witzel-Sproat theory and its connection with other topics that
have created controversy on this list in the past, it might be better to
consider the opinions of those who like the peaceful environment here
and take discussion of this thesis to another list like the yahoo
indology list where it has been posted as:
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/INDOLOGY/message/4841?threaded=1 by Steve
Farmer
And
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/INDOLOGY/message/4847?threaded=1 by
Michael Witzel.
Or perhaps another venue.
