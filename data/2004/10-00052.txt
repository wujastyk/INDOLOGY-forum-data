BJP election manifesto 1998
You probably did not find it because the link to it from their
main Election Manifesto page
   http://bjp.org/manifes/manife99.htm
is broken.  So unless one is able to guess the direct URL, it is
indeed currently inaccessible.  But that is probably just a case
of sloppy website maintenance rather than of deeper political
significance.
All best,
