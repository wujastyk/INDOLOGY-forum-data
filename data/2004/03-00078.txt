I am not sure whether this is of much help for the purpose, because
one would have to go through a fair amount of Sanskrit text, but in
the Mok.sopaaya alias Yogavaasi.s.tha there are quite a few women with
soteriological "knowledge". These women are the main actors in a plot,
by the way superior to their husbands in knowledge and agency; the
most important ones, Liilaa and Cuu.daalaa are queens. References can
be given on request.

Kind regards,
