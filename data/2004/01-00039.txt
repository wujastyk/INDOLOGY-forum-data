Sorry, Jonathan: I cannot answer this question. MSS in the Terai lowlands
(and elsewhere outside the Valley)  were filmed long after I had left the
project.  I know we have filmed Maithili/Skt. MSS in the Janakpur area,
though.

Unfortunately, the new NGMPP CD (rough catalogue of all Skt. etc.,
non-Tibetan MSS) does not specify yet where the MSS were filmed.

We have to ask other former local directors of the project (1970-2002), or
better, contact the NGMPP office in Hamburg, where they are cataloguing (in
detail) all, more than 100 K MSS filmed by the project.

See: http://www.uni-hamburg.de/ngmpp/  or  Nepal Research Centre,
