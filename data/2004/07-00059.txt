anga
Dear Members,
I am looking for primary and secondary sources in Sanskrit traditions on
the theme of impaired-body, deformed body.  I understnad as a metaphor
anga has a significant place in the tranditions (astanga, sadanga) - but
angaviheena is ineligible to access the sacred texts (the Veda) and
perform yajna.
I would be grateful if you could suggest me the sources for reading on
this theme.
