Dear all,

While testing our forthcoming database, I ran across a long forgotten
example of Makaras that I though might be interesting to the "makara"
discussants.

It is the Chakra from the Chausa Hoard in the Patna museum  and dated
from ca. fi4rst century B.C.E. It is one of the earliest examples of
a (pair)  of makara(s) with a human figure emerging from its mouth.

Our Web Master, Andrew LaMoreaux has added it to the Makara
discussion page at the very bottom.

Cheers to all
