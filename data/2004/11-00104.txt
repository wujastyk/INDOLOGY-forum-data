"Gaudasaraswatha" brahmins speaking Konkani
Dear colleagues,
In the useful  little book "Malayalam for beginners" by V.R.
Prabodhachandran Nayar (Trivandrum, 1999, Swantham Books publ.), I come
across this (Malayalam - a linguistic profile - Bilingualism p. 72):
"Pockets of Gaudasaraswatha Brahmins and Chettis ((/ce.t.ti/) who speak two
different varieties of Konkani are mostly in the districts of Ernakulam and
Alappuzha".
Who are these "Gaudasaraswatha" brahmins (coming from Konkan where some
still remain, I suppose)?  Where could I find something about them?
Thank you for your help
