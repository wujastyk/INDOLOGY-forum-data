"Gaudasaraswatha" brahmins speaking Konkani
But wasn't Gauda in Bengal?????? how could it be northern then?

=========================================
The GSB claim, in part on the basis of certain chapters of the
Sahyadrikhanda (see my article mentioned in the previous email), that
Parasurama found that the local Brahmins in the Marathi/Konkani regions,
namely the Chitpavans and the Karhade (=karahataka) turned out to be
unworthy, and that he finally brought a community of northern (gauda)
brahmins to the region of Konkan.
