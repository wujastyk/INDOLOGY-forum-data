Thank you, George, for mentioning Julia's passing, and for your kind and
much-appreciated words.

Julia was Reader in Hindu Studies at the School of Oriental and African
Studies, London University.  Trained in Philosophy at the University of
Sussex, and in Sanskrit and Indian religions at Oxford University, Julia
wrote the books "The Perfect Wife: The Orthodox Hindu Woman According to
the Stridharmapaddhati of Tryambakayajvan", and "Authority and Meaning in
Indian Religions: Hinduism and the case of Valmiki".  She also achieved
that envy of academics, the status of a successful novelist, with her
thriller "Perahera".  In addition to her books, Julia wrote many articles
and chapters, and edited three books of papers on gender, ritual and myth
in India.  She was widely recognised as a gifted educator.  More adequate
memorials of her personal and academic life will circulate in the coming
weeks.

Julia died on Friday morning, after a courageous battle with cancer.  Her
daughters were holding her hands when she died, and during her last weeks
and days she was surrounded by friends and loved ones.

The full details of the arrangements for Julia's funeral, which is to be
at noon this Friday, 1 October, in Amersham, near London, are in the
document at
