I looked inside the Sanskrit 2003 and it is indeed to some degree true.
  But it uses private/corporate use area of the unicode.  So, while it
does not pollute the area meant for other scripts, documents prepared
with Sanskrit 2003 in mind will not work without that font.  This does
not seem very good.

Does it suffice to say that the document prepared on my Mac looks fine
on my PC as well (except for the fact that Windows demands LF/CR for
line ending :)?  Document encodings and rendering of  the data (where
fonts are involved) appear to be very well separated, following the
spirit of unicode on both Windows and OS X.  Let us hope that people
will not start using "special" fonts.

I actually do not see the Mac problem here.   The only major problem
would be that OS X does not support rendering using OpenType font very
well yet.

Oh, I again was only talking about OS X native apps.  Classic Mac OS or
Carbon apps, including MS Word, is entirely a different issue.
