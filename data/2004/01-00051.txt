Subject: Peking Kanjur/Tanjur contents table?
Message-ID: <161227073776.23782.3156227807384913782.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Friends,

I wonder if anyone has or knows of a table correlating which Peking
Kanjur/Tanjur texts are in which volumes of the reprint edition. I
know of the catalogue, of course, but I do not have a copy, and since
the whole of our university's set of the Kanjur/Tanjur is in storage,
it must be requested by volume number. Therefore, a table of text
numbers to reprint vol. would be most helpful.

Any hints most welcome (apologies for cross-posting to H-Buddhism and
Indology).
