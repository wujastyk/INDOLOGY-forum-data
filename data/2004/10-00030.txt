Yogasutras
I suggest my own edition of the Yoga-sutras entitled "Los Yoga-sutras de Patanjali" editorial Arbol, Mexico. It is in Spanish. It contains translation of each word of the sutras, translation and an exhasrtive commentary.If your friend knows Spanish, this edition will be very useful. It"s second edition will soon be out.

Dear members of the list,
I friend has asked me if there is an edition of Patanjali's Yogasutras with
the skt. text and an English translation available. She is of course looking
for the best edition of this kind. Any suggestions?
Best regards,
Lars Martin Fosse
