Dear List,

A student who is planning to go to Kerala to study yoga and dance traditions
has asked me to recommend good beginning grammars of Malayalam [in Engish].
She has good language skills, but only in European languages.  I pass this
on to the list's ziSTas.

Thanks in advance,

George Thompson
