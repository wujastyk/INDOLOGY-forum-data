A very minor comment indeed: in my experience at least this indeed commonly
invoked principle is generally referred to in primary sources (I have seen it
in "saastric literature of various kinds, including Nyaaya and Vyaakara.na,
kaavya-commentaries, tantra-commentaries etc.) as si.mhaavalokitanyaaya rather
than as si.mhaavalokananyaaya.
