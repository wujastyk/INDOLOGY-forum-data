Perhaps I should have been a little less terse ...
I was wondering if it would be possible to read _'drul ba_ not as:
  pUti
     2[ p'Uti ]2 mfn. putrid , foul-smelling &c. (MW p. 641 col. 3)
but as:
  pUti
     2[ p'Uti ]1 f. purity , purification &c. (MW p. 641 col. 1)
Granted this reading may still be odd ;-)
Best,
