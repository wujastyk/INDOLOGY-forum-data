SV: Stolen goods
Thank you, John!
There is quite a bit of a bother in Norway now after two programs about the
Schoyen collection where some parts are known or presumed to have been
stolen from Kabul Museum, Gilgit and Iraq. The programs were in my opinion
highly destructive, a considerable strategic blunder which is likely to make
things worse rather than better. However, in anticipation of a debate, I
have listed a few possible remedies for the protection of antiquities. Such
Internet pages as this are on the list as one of several remedies.
Best regards,
Lars Martin
