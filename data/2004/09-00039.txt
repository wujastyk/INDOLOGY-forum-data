Subject: IndUni fonts


I have put a new set of fonts on my website: they are TrueType fonts
with OpenType extensions, and they aim to cover all the accented
characters needed by Indologists and similar scholars. They seem to me
to work well under Windows (XP; I'm using Word XP), though as yet the
more outr? ones can only be accessed via the Private Use Area.
They're based on the usual URW++ originals.

The fonts are at http://bombay.oriental.cam.ac.uk: follow the "fonts"
link, then the "induni" link.

Best wishes,
John
