Dict. of Tse ring dbang rgyal 115b1: bya gag = nakulii , dauksha, the
latter obscure to me (the Skt in this dictionary often appears in
forms that require considerable decoding), the former meaning female
ichneuomon, acc to MW--thus not a snake, but in fact the enemy of a
snake...

(Note that the Brda dkrol gser gyi me long p. 544 has a definition of
bya gag, with rather extensive citations [which I omit]: 1) khyim
bya'i ming, 2) chu bya dkar po ske ring lu gu'i tshad tsam pa zhig gi
ming.)
