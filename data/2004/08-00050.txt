In fact I have doubts about the pre-Buddhist credentials of
ChAndogya VII, at least in the form in which it has
come down to us. I have discussed  this text in "Indra's
Search for the Self," reprinted in my book Reason's Traces
(Wisdom 2001). In particular, the typically Buddhist
use there of upa-labh (Reason's Traces, pp. 79ff), when considered
together with the actual content of the argument, suggests the
possibility that the final redaction occurred only
after Buddhist ideas were current. But I would be
interested to know how others interpret these data.
Note, however, that it does not make good sense in this
case to hold that early Buddhist material is
just reflecting the general Upanishadic milieu. ChAndogya
VII seems excpetional in both vocabulary and content,
and so cannot be taken to represent Upanishadic generalities.
