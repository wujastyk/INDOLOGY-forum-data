"stream". From a logical viewpoint this could be avoided if ledmac did
its processing first, before utfskt sets in, and if utfskt per default
combined adjacent \Nag-tags into one continuous "stream", but I have no
idea whether this can be done technically. (It might also lead to
problems because Devanagari text occupies more space than roman text,
and the assignment of critical notes to lines in the main text might be
imprecise if they are computed before Devanagari is processed.)

Oh well ... I would greatly appreciate any hints towards either a
solution with these two packages, or solutions with other packages - but ideally, with these two, since I'd really like to keep my source files in Unicode.

Thanks, and best regards,

Birgit Kellner
