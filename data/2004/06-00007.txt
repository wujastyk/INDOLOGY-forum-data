Works on vaastu/geomancy?
Is anyone aware of academic works on the subject of vaastu-shaastra as a
divinatory art, either in its more traditional forms or in its westernized
New Age incarnation? Secondarily, any recommended reading on other
geomantic traditions (e.g., feng shui) would also be much appreciated.
