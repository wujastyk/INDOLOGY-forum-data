Snakes
The late Professor Ronald Morton Smith wrote an article with the intriguing
title: "Rejected Dragons, Accepted Snakes". It was supposed to appear in
Lakshman Sarup Centenary Volume (Chandigarh). It was listed as "forthcoming"
in the bibliography of his works which appears in Professor Smith's
Festschrift (Corolla Torotonensis. Studies in honour of Ronald Morton Smith,
Toronto 1994 - coedited by me). Has anybody seen this article?
