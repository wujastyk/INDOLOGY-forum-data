We have the text of the Mansehra and Shahbazgarhi versions online
at the EBMP site:

   http://depts.washington.edu/ebmp/software.html

This is based on the Hultzsch edition, input in 1997 by Nakatani
Hideaki (contact details in the file), and with corrections by
Andrew Glass.

I am not aware of more comprehensive online resources, but would
also be interested to learn of such.  Maybe the Indoskript project

   http://www.indoskript.de/

has done something in that direction, but if so it?s not on their
website yet.

Stefan
