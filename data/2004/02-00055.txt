Emne: [ScS] South Asian snake lore


Dear members of the list,

I am looking for recent references to South Asian Naga-lore or
snake-lore. They may apply to any historical period including the
present, but I am primarily interested in works written recently.

Thank you for information on this topic.

With best wishes,

Ruth Schmidt
