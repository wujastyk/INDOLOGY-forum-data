Emne: [ScS] South Asian snake lore
Dear members of the list,
I am looking for recent references to South Asian Naga-lore or
snake-lore. They may apply to any historical period including the
present, but I am primarily interested in works written recently.
Thank you for information on this topic.
With best wishes,
Ruth Schmidt
