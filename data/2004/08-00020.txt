Dear Colleagues,

If anyone knows anyone in Burma working on the conservation of palm
leaf manuscripts, could they please directly communicate with Ms.
Tandon, a former intern in conservation at LOC, whose message to me is
below?  I would appreciate being carboned, however, since that is an
issue of concern to me as well.

Thanks,

Allen

Dear Allen,

I hope you remember meeting with me at the Library where I was working

as Fulbright scholar in the Conservation Division with Jesse Munn to
develop approaches for conservation of palm leaf manuscripts under your

charge in the year 2001. I hope you are doing well .
After my return to India, I established a NGO here in J&K called
Preserve Art Treasure and Heritage. We are working in rural areas for
spreading awareness about Preventive Conservation most of the time, And

now I am going to present a Paper on our work in Yangon Myanmar at the

7th International Symposium on Cultural Heritage being organized by
ASEAN and Aus Heritage from
21-25th August . I leave day after tomorrow. I know this is too short a

notice but I was hoping find some contacts there to look into
preservation problems of Palm leaf manuscript collections while I am
there.


Looking forward to your response,

With sincere regards,

Aparna
