Heidelberg Nepali Intensive Course 2005
Nepali Intensive Course
Heidelberg, March 1 ? 24, 2005
If you think you won't need more than some English for the beaten tracks
round the Annapurna, ? you're right. But it might not get you much
further. Nepali has increasingly become a lingua franca of the central
Himalayas where more and more of its diverse ethnic groups speak it as a
second language. Nepal itself is a small country at a political
crossroads where past and present clash more forcefully than elsewhere.
Whether you are interested in contemporary Nepal or ancient South Asia,
the Nepali language opens a door to both. To help you to walk through
this door Laxminath Shrestha has come all the way from the Kathmandu
Valley to the South Asia Institute in Heidelberg. He is an experienced
teacher who has taught Nepali to generations of both students and
researchers and has proven that he can make you start speaking in just
one week. Starting from the first day, this beginner's course will be
held only in Nepali. You will read newspaper clippings and, sipping a
cup of ciya, discuss the latest political developments, - as one does
every morning in the streets of Kathmandu.
