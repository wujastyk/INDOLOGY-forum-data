AmRtatarangi.nii of Lak.smiidhara
Dear members of the list,
is there somebody who could have some information (edition, dating, study)
about the AmRtatarangi.nii of Lak.smiidhara (son of NRsi.mha, distinct from
the famous nibandha, ), an advaitic commentary on the Bhaagavatapuraa.na
(not listed in the Ahmedabad critical edition)  which is found in
malayalam-script manuscripts only (but much less popular in Kerala than the
commentary K.r.s.napadii of Raaghavaananda).
