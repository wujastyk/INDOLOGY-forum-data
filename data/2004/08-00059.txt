Citta

Although far from being an expert in the Upanisads, I did get a gut feeling
that there is something odd about this passage.
However, my present concern with citta concerns the various etymologies
proposed in (Buddhist) commentorial literature --CI, CIT or CINT and the
like. I am interested in the way different derivations are used to underpin
various doctrinal positions.  I suppose a similar diversity can be observed
in non-Buddhist commentorial literature so I was wondering which derivations
are older than others.
Best wishes,
