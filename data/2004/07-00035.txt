Snakes
Birgit Kellner
As was mentioned in the article posted by Allen Thrasher, the saw-scaled
viper makes a characteristic rasping or rattling noise with its scales -- it
seems to be the only snake in India that does this.  Could this be the
meaning, given that this snake is quite common in parts of India ?
Best wishes,
