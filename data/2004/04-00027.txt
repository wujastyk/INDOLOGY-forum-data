Corrections
Dear All:
I discover mistakes and blunders as soon as I open a new book for the
first time; a phenomenon, I trust, you are all familiar with. There
are many in the several translations I have published over the years;
especially in the widely-used translation of the Upanisads published
in the Oxford World's Classics Series.
I have now put all the needed correction for the Upanisads and for
other books on my web site. You can access them at the following URL:

It was difficult to get the diacritics to work on both the PC and MAC
platforms; so we have made images for the diacritics; pardon the
roughness observed sometimes
Thanks.
Patrick Olivelle
