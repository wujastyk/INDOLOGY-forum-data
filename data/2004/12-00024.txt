Subject: Science Mag: "no Indus script"
In-Reply-To: <HLEGKKDFGLJBBKJBLEMCIEBPDMAA.gthomgt@adelphia.net>
Message-ID: <161227075520.23782.4940759064984442183.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Although I personally welcome spirited discussion on this list... given
the already contentious nature of the debate about the recent
Farmer-Witzel-Sproat theory and its connection with other topics that
have created controversy on this list in the past, it might be better to
consider the opinions of those who like the peaceful environment here
and take discussion of this thesis to another list like the yahoo
indology list where it has been posted as:

http://groups.yahoo.com/group/INDOLOGY/message/4841?threaded=1 by Steve
Farmer

And
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/INDOLOGY/message/4847?threaded=1 by
Michael Witzel.

Or perhaps another venue.

Best,

Dean Anderson
