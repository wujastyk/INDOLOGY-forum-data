Makara Website
Dear John Huntington,
Thanks so much for posting this lovely makara collection with comment. Is
there any chance that the composite bird perched on the lotus that grows out
of the makara's water tail might be a version of the phoenix? I'm curious
also as to how you know the makara's tail is a "water" tail: is that how
it's glossed in the relevant languages?
Regards,
Joanna Kirkpatrick
