Hello,
The word pantal - the t is voiced - is still used as such in Malayalam  
in the sense of "a temporary roof, a shed, booth, shelter,
  or triumphal arch, esp. for temporary use (at a festival, etc.); a marquee;
a tent or booth for a marriage." Thanneerpantal wherefrom water is  
supplied especially in summer, is famous in Tamilnadu.
