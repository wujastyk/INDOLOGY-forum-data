Indology and "the disastrous  ideology of the 'pure Aryan              race'"
I would like to suggest humbly that this subject has been  
sufficiently explored in this list.  In any event, I thought the  
Indology list is concerns issues and ideas pertaining to classical  
Indian studies, whether in Sanskrit or, occasionally, in the other  
classical language of India, Tamil (which is non-Indo-European and  
certainly does not represent the "pure Aryan race," whatever that  
is).  If some members wish to pursue aspects of the history of the  
Third Reich, perhaps they could start another list.  George Hart
