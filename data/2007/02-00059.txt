Dear Colleagues,

Apologies for cross-posting.

Below I have copied the 2007 Call for Papers for the American Academy  
of Religion's "Yoga in Theory and Practice Consultation." The AAR  
meeting will be held November 17-20th, 2007, in San Diego,  
California. We were greatly pleased by the range and quality of the  
proposals received last year, and strongly encourage those  
considering submitting a proposal this year on a topic related to  
yoga to do so to our consultation. The Call for Papers includes  
topics especially of interest to the consultation, though submissions  
on other topics will be considered. A list of contacts is provided as  
well.

Submissions should be made through the OP3 system, which can be found  
at the following link:
