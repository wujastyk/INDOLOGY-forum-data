Asking?
Dear colleagues: 
  In the National Cheung Kung University, Bulletin of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology (Vol 67, p 332).  It is reported  studies made by specialists in environmental contamination, inside  a temple in the city of Taiwan and those researcher compared the air with taken samples of an intersection of vehicular traffic. They found that  air inside the temple there were very high concentrations of hydrocarbons aromatic polic?clicos (PAH), a great group of chemical highly carcinogenic that they are liberated when certain inciense substances are burnt. Is my question now, if there are studies of this in India? Because the Chinese incience is different from the India. Can some body give scientific information in this respect? 
  Sincerily
