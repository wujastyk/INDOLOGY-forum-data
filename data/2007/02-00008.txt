Bhattoji Diksita's Tattvakaustubha
Dear friends,
     The advaitic work of Bhattoji Diksita, namely the Tattvakaustubha, was partially printed 
from Srirangam by the Vani Vilas Press.  If anyone has access to this text and can send me 
either a pdf or a photocopy, do let me know at mmdesh at umich.edu .  I am also looking for 
information regarding manuscripts of works titled Bhattoji-kuttana composed by Maadhva 
authors Kundalagiri and others.  Any pointers in that direction would be much appreciated.  
Thanks in advance.
