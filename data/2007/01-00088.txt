A question concerning the proposal to shut down the previous              thread
Thanks for the primer on the general conventions of academic debate.
May those who consider themselves in a position 
to contribute to a resolution of this and other 
complex and contentious issues lay out their 
evidence and arguments in fully circumstanced 
academic publications rather than in the 
ping-pong of an electronic list in which extended 
discussion tends to generate more heat than light.
Now back to my own time at place, which, for 
today's segment of academic enquiry, happens to be Calcutta, 1802-1806.
A good day to all,
Rosane Rocher
