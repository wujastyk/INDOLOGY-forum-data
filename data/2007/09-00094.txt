privative a with finite verb
It may be worth remarking that Dravidian languages (like many other  
families) puts the negative into the verb.  It's also notable that  
Germanic can put the alpha-privative onto the beginning of the verb  
(undo).  I don't know enough about IE to say whether the Sanskrit  
phenomenon could be a reflection of either one of these things.
