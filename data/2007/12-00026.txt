Mac-Devanagari
Using Nisus Pro (I've been using only Nisus since it first came out  
long ago) on Mac OS X.5 Leopard, I've come across one "indological"  
fault. Whereas it used to be possible (on Tiger, with an Intel Mac and  
2 Gb RAM) to open the Monier-Williams 37 Mb. humongous file with  
Nisus, and do useful work with it, it now freezes up the program, or  
slows it down to the point you can't do anything with it. As an  
alternative, I've been using the latest NeoOffice for MW, while  
patiently awaiting updates both to the OS and Nisus.
Meanwhile, any suggestions?

I've also found that Nisus Pro works excellently with the Devanagari  
font available from Ecological Linguistics, Washington DC.  As for  
Word, I gave up on Microsoft some time ago: the font I use faultlessly  
in Nisus Pro has strange quirks in Word.  George Cardona
