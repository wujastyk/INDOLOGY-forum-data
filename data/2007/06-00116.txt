Bibliography on the Kasikavrtti
Dear Pascale,
thanks for this information. The SARAI website contains a page of links to 
online South Asia bibliographies at
<http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/indiv/southasia/cuvl/BIBS.html>
and links to two of Yves Ramseier's bibliographies, including this one. 
Will the updated version be published online? Please let me know so that I 
can post updated links.
Many thanks,
David Magier, PhD
South Asia Librarian
