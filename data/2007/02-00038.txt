Dear Barbara,

Some students who want to participate in the Bhagavadgiitaa class  
asked me to deposit copies of the text in the library.  I've seen how  
others do it.  Could I have a box for the Giitaa there?  Also, I'm  
wondering if I could get a copy card to make copies for them.

All the best,
