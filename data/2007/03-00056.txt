Dear Colleagues,

I am trying to collect together secondary literature on Aryashura's 
Jatakamala.

Does anyone have any recommendations?

While I do have an interest in Jatakamalas by other authors and in the 
concept of Jatakamala as a genre (e.g. the work of Michael Hahn on 
Haribhatta and Gopadatta), I am particularly seeking out studies on 
Aryashura. (Works such as Khoroche's notes towards a critical edition 
and Schlingloff's discussion of Ajanta and the Jatakamala are already 
familiar to me.)

Yours,

Justin Meiland
