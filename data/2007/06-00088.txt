Gujarati Word
Would anyone know the common meaning of a Gujarati word which when 
given in Sanskrit is like this: ghaNTaala? This is given by Hemadri 
in his Caturvargacintamani (3/1.492: gurjaradeze) in explaining the 
Sanskrit term :ghaaNTika. I am also not quite sure about the exact 
meaning of the Sanskrit term, which, in Visnu Smriti 45.25 appears to 
indicate some kind of a bad person (in Hemadri he is listed as 
apaankeya). Thanks.
