Indology and "the disastrous  ideology of the 'pure Aryan              race'"
Good morning, Reinhold, 
See my previous comments on that memorable
meeting in Leipzig, and why I referred to the
mentioned issues of ZDMG ... My position is clear
to those who take the time to read my previous
mails on Making the Argument for Sanskrit. I have
no further comments to add at this moment, and
still a lot of homework to do among which, yes,
also writing to the Berlin authorities -- rest
assured, in my letters to them I will not refer
to the sensitive period in
German-European-International indology. 
Cheers,
JH
