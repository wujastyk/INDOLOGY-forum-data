Mac-Devanagari
Apart from Devanagari -- Marco Franceschini pointed out to me that if  
you are writing with a US-extended keyboard and a Unicode font which  
includes diacritics, such as Arial,the following keystrokes generate  
all you really need to type transliterated Sanskrit on a Mac OS X  
Tiger or Leopard:
macron: ALT-a + letter, as in ? ?, ? ? ? etc.
underdot: ALT-x + letter, as in ? ? ? ? ? (note: ALT-a + r  
will yield long vowel "r" - if you're lucky")
overdot: ALT-w + letter, as in ? ?
acute accent/palatal: ALT-e + letter, as in ? ?
double palatal (used in Semitic languages, etc.): ALT-v + letter :  
??? ?
brevis: ALT-b + letter: ? ?
On some letters, ALT-h yields underline: ?, ?, ? ?.
These combinations work with capitals too.
I'm not at all sure that the examples will come through as such in  
this email, as a matter of fact I'll be quite surprised if they do.

The OS X version of Nisus Writer Pro is an extremely good word  
processor and works well with unicode (both Devanagari and Tamil are  
built-in to Leopard and Tiger).  I think the new Word for Mac coming  
out in January may not handle unicode properly -- we'll see.  Nisus  
reads and writes Word files and uses rtf as its default format.   
TextEdit (which is free and also comes with the OS) also works well  
with unicode.  But of course TextEdit won't do footnotes and the  
like.  George Hart
