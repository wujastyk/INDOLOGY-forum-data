Clarification:  It has been brought to my attention by Michael Radich 
that there is more than one scan of Burnouf's Introduction on Google 
books, so I have been talking about a different scan than others 
apparently!

compare

http://books.google.com/books?id=nTYAAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA1&dq=inauthor:burnouf#PPA209,M1

another wrinkle...  JAS

PS:  the clean one is the 1844 edition, it turns out, the problematic 
one the 1876 edition. I had actually looked for the 1844 one 
initially but (bad metadata?) could not find it. Ironically, as far 
as I can see, I can't download the 1844 edition from Google. 
Displaying my utter ignorance, is it possible to download the entire 
book from DLI ?
