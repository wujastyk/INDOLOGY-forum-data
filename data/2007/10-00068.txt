Here is some more information on "Nira-Narsingpur" in Maharashtra, from the Wikipedia article on the Bhima River:
"The Bhima River originates in Bhimashankar hills near Karjat on the western side of Western Ghats, known as Sahyadri, in Maharashtra state in India. Bhima flows southeast for 725 km through Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh states. Bhima is one of the two majors rivers in Maharastra, the other being Nira River. Nira confluences with Bhima in Narsingpur, Solapur. Bhima is a major tributary of the Krishna River. Its banks are densely populated and form a fertile agricultural area."
