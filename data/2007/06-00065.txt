Duryodhana's dice game / THE GAME OF DICE 
Dear  Sir,
                 I would like to know as to how  THE GAME OF DICE /
Duryodhana's  dice game  from The Mahabharata  was played ?   What type of
game did Shakuni and Yudhishthir play -  what type of board game  was it ?
and  how many throws of dice it took  for a turn of the game to be completed
and how many turns of the game were  there .  It is also stated that the
game was already rigged by Shakuni - how was the game already rigged , were
the dice connected with  magic  or were  the dice loaded with weights. I
would also like to know how did the dice look like , how many numbers or
back spots were there on each side of the dice and how many dice were  used
in the game .
                                     Any information regarding how it is
played ie the technique of the game would be appreciated by me dearly .
                                      Looking forward to your answer soon.
Thank you very much.  
Yours sincerely,
elizabeth
