Etymology of Tamil 'maiyam'
Dear Indologists,
The Tamil word 'maiyam' meaning 'center, middle'  seems to be derived  
ultimately from Sanskrit 'madhya'. I would like to know the Prakrit dialect  which 
was the direct source for the Tamil word. I do not have Pischel's work at  hand.
Thanks in advance.
Regards,
S. Palaniappan
