Subject: Etymology of Tamil 'maiyam'
Message-ID: <161227079816.23782.16596173152909926891.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear Indologists,
 
The Tamil word 'maiyam' meaning 'center, middle'  seems to be derived  
ultimately from Sanskrit 'madhya'. I would like to know the Prakrit dialect  which 
was the direct source for the Tamil word. I do not have Pischel's work at  hand.
 
Thanks in advance.
 
Regards,
S. Palaniappan
