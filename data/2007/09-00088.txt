privative a with finite verb
See Astadhyayi 6.3.73 (72 in Kielhorn's edition of the Mahabhasya) 
nalopo na~na.h. The varttika on that sutra calls for the inclusion of 
the a-privative even with finite verbs. The Mahabhasya on that varttika 
gives as examples:
	apacasi vai tva.m jaalma
	akaro.si vai tva.m jaalma
I do recall seeing such a usage outside grammatical texts, but I don't 
recall where.
