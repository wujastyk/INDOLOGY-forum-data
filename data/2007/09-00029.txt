Subject: Vilocana on Visvanatha's Sahityadarpana?
Message-ID: <161227081116.23782.5969166020793737756.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I'd like to ask the list for help with a problem that I have been unable to 
solve with the means available to me.

The Sansknet project (resurrected under a new URL some time ago) has 
an electronic text of a commentary on Visvanatha's Sahityadarpana. The  
1st pariccheda, e.g., which can be found here:

http://sansknet.ac.in/Sahityam/Sahityadarpanam/Vilochana/Parichada1.h
tm

has the following colophon:
iti 'srii-Mahe'svaranyaayaala.mkaara-bha.t.taacaarya-viracitaayaa.m 
Saahityadarpa.na-tiikaayaam prathama.h pariccheda.h.

Now, there is a commentary by one Mahesvaratarkalamkara 
(note: -tarka-, not -nyaya-!), 
called Vij~napriyaa
(published in 1998 by the Bharatiya Buk Karporesan [Book Corporation]; 
ISBN 81-85122-13-X; unavailable here).

On the other hand, what is usually known as the Sahityadarpanatika is 
Haridasa's Kusumapratima.

A have found no reference whatsoever to Mahesvaranyayalamkara, or to 
the title under which his tika is filed on Sanknet: "Vilochana" [= 
Vilocanaa].
[The Locana commentary by Visvanatha's son, Anantadasa, by the way, 
is filed separately under "Lochana", as may be expected.]

Any confirmation that the commentator's name and the title are correct 
would already be a great help.


Thanks in advance
Reinhold Gr?nendahl
