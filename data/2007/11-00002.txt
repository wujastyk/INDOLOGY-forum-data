A belated further ref.:

"saiva tantras have inherited, expanded and re-interpreted the  
saa"nkhya system of tattvas, an important category in "saiva  
soteriology. The exegetes clearly interpret tattvas as universals  
(the situation in the earlier tantras themselves is not so uniform),  
Abhinavagupta even approximates Kumaarila's terminology (anugaamin <  
anuyaayin, ekavargiikara.na < ekabuddhinibandhana etc.).  For a  
fuller discussion see my p.189 ff. in my "Yoga of the  
Malinivijayottara", Collection Indologie 97, Pondicherry 2004.
