Boehtlingk's Paninis Grammatik
Doesn't work for me.  First, the search below just brought up lots of 
copies of Bopp.
Eventually, using "boehtlingk" inauthor, I found Panini's Grammatik, but 
the actual files it gives are Grassmann's Woerterbuch.  And it's "limited 
preview" only.
There are different licensing rules for books.google.com in the USA and 
outside, so it's not always possible to access the same titles and/or 
download possibilities when logging in from outside the USA.
Best,
Dominik
