Asunto: Brahma muhurtha synonym?
Has anyone ever heard of a Hindi or Sanskrit synonym for Brahma Muhurtha
which might sound something like 'navasvam' or 'nabasvan'?
Brahma Muhurtha is the time 2 muhurthas (about 1 1/2 hours) before
sunrise which is considered especially auspicious in Hinduism.
Thanks,
Dean Anderson
