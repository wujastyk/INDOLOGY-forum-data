New issue EJVS 14-1 at new location              (www.ejvs.laurasianacademy.com)
Dear Colleagues,
The Electronic Journal of Vedic Studies has changed its location from 
http://shore.net, later called 
http://users.primushost.com/~india/ejvs/, to a new URL:
<http://www.ejvs.laurasianacademy.com/>,
a website concerned with the historical comparative mythology of 
Eurasia and beyond. The  contents of the journal are preserved as it 
was published over the past twelve years.
The email list connected with the journal has accordingly been changed 
to
<http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ejvs>
Subscribers are requested to re-subscribe at this location: 
<http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ejvs>
This year?s issues begin with a list of the mantras of the Baudhayana 
Srautasutra that constitute part of the basis of Makato Fushimi?s PhD 
thesis (Harvard 2007), but which have not been included there due to 
their extent.
