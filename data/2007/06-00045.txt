> Dear friend,
I know of one such study where the Ramayana of Valmiki and the Tamil
Ramayana of Kampan has been compared. The study was by one Mr. Sankarraju
Naidu, who was in the Hindi Department of University of Madras. It has
been published some twenty years back.
Thanks
Ganesan

Could someone please recommend comparative studies of the different
