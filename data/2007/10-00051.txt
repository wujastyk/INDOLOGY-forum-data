AW: AW: Soteriology of universals
Paul,
I actually use the second edition of 1987. Momentariness etc., as
vastudharmas that are meditated upon appear already in the beginning of the
text (p. 324,6, cf. also 338-339 etc.).
See also Steinkellner's paper "Yogische Erkenntnis als Problem im
Buddhismus". In: Transzendenzerfahrung, Vollzugshorizont des Heils. Wien
1978, 121-134.
Up to Dharmakirti, the truthfulness of yogic perception is not a problem; it
is guarantied by its virtual identity of its content with the Buddha's
teaching. After Dharmakirti, probably due to the Mimamsa critique, the
perspective changes and the topic of yogic perception is largely taken over
by the problem of omniscience. The Buddha becomes the exemplary yogi, but in
his case we cannot rely on the Buddha's word to guarantee the validity of
his cognitions.
Best wishes,
Eli

Eli,
That's interesting.  Can you provide a citation 
for that argument (the 
_Jnanasrimitra-nibandhavali_ (Patna, 1959), I 
assume)?
    Of course, once you start talking about the 
perspective of an omniscient consciousness, it's 
a whole different affair.
best,
Paul Hackett
