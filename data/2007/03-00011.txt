Vaastusuutropani.sad
Dear Indologists,
I seem to recall having heard that the same suspicion that surrounds  
the authenticity of some of the other texts from Orissa in whose  
publication Sadasiva Ratha Sharma has been involved, also surrounds  
the Vaastusuutropani.sad, published by A. Boner -- S.R. Sharma -- B.  
B?umer (3rd rev. edition, Delhi 1996).
Is anybody aware of reviews of this publication?
Thank you!
