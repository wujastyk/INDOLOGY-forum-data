Subject: "vyasa smrti" verse?
Message-ID: <161227079742.23782.3651322217206268289.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

sa.mpraapte tu kalau kaale vindhyaadrer uttare sthitaa.h

This verse about the southern location of the best traditions during 
the Kali yuga is cited by Altekar, History of Benares from Pre-historic 
Times to the Present Day, 1937, p.38, as being from "smritis like the 
Vyasa".  Does anyone have a more precise reference for this verse, or 
anything close to it?

Many thanks,
Dominik
