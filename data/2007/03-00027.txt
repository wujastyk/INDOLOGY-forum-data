Antonio.

Thanks for the quick reply. I will go ahead and order it from the site 
you give. However, I was hoping to play the section covering at least 
the Samhita-, Pada-, Krama-pathas, and one or two of the secondary 
pathas of this verse (address to goddess speech) to my class on Tuesday. 
It is the *102* - ?gveda - Vik?ti Recitation 
<http://www.smithsonianglobalsound.org/trackdetail.aspx?itemid=10294> of 
the verse beginning devii.m vaacam ajanayanta ... . Is there any chance 
you could send me a copy of this section (perhaps as mp3)?

By the way, how was your experience reading Gandhari with Richard in 
Leiden? Any interest in pursuing it further?

Regards
