from Francesco
Dear Kengo,
I have just downloaded the last number of the Newsletter of the  
NGMCP, which is as ever not only very interesting but also beautiful  
from the aesthetical point of view. I thank you very much for your  
work on my paper.
I know that you have met Paolo and Camilla, who have been happy to  
keep contact with you.
I hope you will come to Italy next year, and that we have soon the  
opportunity to meet again.
With many warm greetings, yours sincerely
Francesco
