asva sastra
I have a personal copy of the Saraswati Mahal Asvasastra text 
(illustrated), but I don't think that's at issue.  I'm sure Dr Sandeep 
Joshi has his own copy.  The Tanjore SM has an active programme of 
reprinting their publications (which sell incredibly well, especially the 
Tamil titles).
