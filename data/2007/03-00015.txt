Leiden Indological Summer School 2007
Dear colleagues,
With apologies for the somewhat delayed announcement, I would like to  
ask you attention for this year's second edition of the Leiden  
Indological Summer School. All information is now online, and  
registration is open at: <http://www.letteren.leidenuniv.nl/ 
summerschools/>. This year, we have found Diwakar Acharya and  
Jonathan Silk willing to offer three exciting courses. Please pass  
this information on to any students who might be interested in  
participating.
Unfortunately, it was not yet possible to organize parallel to the  
Sanskrit courses an intensive course in Old Javanese, as I had  
previously foreseen, and announced privately to some colleagues.  
Perhaps this will work out next year.
