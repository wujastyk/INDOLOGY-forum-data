Subject: privative a with finite verb
Message-ID: <161227081255.23782.2727117463850844054.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Louis Renou, Grammaire sanscrite, Paris 1961, p. 175, emphasizing the extreme rareness of this formation, refers to the example in this Vaarttika: 
"un Vaart. conna?t le tour pejoratif et sans doute vulgaire akaro.si Pat., cf. Franke BB XXIII 171." 
Moreover, Renou refers among other places to the Mahaabhaarata, d.r;syate 'd.r;syate caapi Mhbh XIII 14 160 (I did not check the critical edition); to a rare form in the Kaavyas: asp.rhayati ;Si;s[upaalavadha?], to a usage by ;Sa:nkara cited in Deussen's System Ved. 39 Franke ZDMG XLVIII 85 (contest? Thibaud ib. 540). 
Whether other "artificial" finite verb-compounds such as pacati-pacatitaraam (MBhaa.sya on 8.1.4) were ever used outside grammarians' discussions I don't know, I did not find it in Renou's grammar.

See Astadhyayi 6.3.73 (72 in Kielhorn's edition of the Mahabhasya) 
nalopo na~na.h. The varttika on that sutra calls for the inclusion of 
the a-privative even with finite verbs. The Mahabhasya on that varttika 
gives as examples:

    apacasi vai tva.m jaalma
    akaro.si vai tva.m jaalma

I do recall seeing such a usage outside grammatical texts, but I don't 
recall where.
