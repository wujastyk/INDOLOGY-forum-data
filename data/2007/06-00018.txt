A query from a non-member for consideration of the list.
a question
I wish to post a question. The shlokas of the mantrapushpam begin as 
"yopam pushpam veda pushpavan prajavan pashuvan bhavati. 
Chandramavapam pushpam pushpavan etc. ya evam veda yopamayanam veda 
ayatanavan bhavati"
What is the significance of pushpam and how one becomes pushpavan 
etc? Also could you please explain the significance of the words "ya 
evam veda yopamayanam veda ayatanavan bhavati". Can someone enlighten 
me?
Thanks
Dilip Chirmuley
