Birgit commented:
 
"Maybe both phenomena are to be explained in the same way: they charge so 
much money because they can, and because selling these items in a large 
number is not important to them (they don't use up much storage space)."

I once saw a newspaper article posted in a used bookstore explaining that the goal of pricing in a printed o.p. catalog was to produce precisely one order.  More would entail the labor and expense of responding to late orders, with possible irritation on the part of customers.  Obviously not a science, though.

On the other hand, different booksellers obviously have different pricing strategies, some seeking high prices, others quick turnover.
