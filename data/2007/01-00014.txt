Making the Argument for Sanskrit
Dear colleagues,
I rather agree with Lars Martin. It is not much use to say that 
"Indology is a field of study that offers students a rigorous 
intellectual training that is applicable to almost any of their future 
fields of study and employment", many other fields are capable of the 
same claim. The fascination of the study and the aesthetic value are 
also poor arguments. What matters is the importance of India (and South 
Asia) and the essential role of Sanskrit in understanding it. To 
cultural and religious arguments we could also add linguistics and 
history -- everywhere Sanskrit is important.
