pratiika/allegory
Dear Matthew,
While I don't have any suggestion for the earliest use of 
pratiika as a possible calque for allegory, I do know (from 
a conversation with Aditya Behl a year or so ago) that the 
term is used more widely in Hindi literary criticism to 
describe, for instance, the similarly 'allegorical' 
dimensions of the Sufi premaakhyaans. 
As for a local theory of allegory, I have one suggestion.  
It was a few years ago, but I remember that in "Sivaraama's 
commentary on the Naagaananda (edited by T. Ganapati Sastri, 
Trivandrum Sanskrit Series no. 59), he consistently referred 
to the second, 'allegorical' dimension to the plot under the 
rubric of 'garbhokti'.  
I don't recall how systematic "Sivaraama was in applying 
this, nor incidentally do I know any details of his time or 
place (though I presume he may have been from Kerala, given 
that he also commented on the plays of Kula"sekharavarman, 
which were I believe works of strictly local circulation).  
I've never seen this rubric used in any work on dramaturgy 
or ala.mkaara---though other list members certainly may have-
best,
