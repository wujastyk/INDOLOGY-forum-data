avagraha in Malayalam Manuscript
Thanks for bringing back the topic.  I have finally located the sign  
best interpreted as avagraha in the manuscript(s) I used.  I think I  
can finally fulfill my promise...
Scans are available at:

"tu?abdo 'vadh" (this is the end of the line, and continues  
"?ra??rtha?".)

"yogagrah?e 'sati"
The second one is small and ambiguous, but the other two share a  
distinctive shape; the shape described by Asko Parpola in the post on  
September 2, 2007.
As I mentioned in an earlier post, these are anomalies.  It turns out  
that these fragments all come from a single folio (folio 4 of the  
manuscript of the P?ta?jalayoga??stravivara?a, perserved in the  
Oriental Manuscript Library, Trivandrum, L. 662).  I could not find  
any more (although I cannot claim that I have been thorough).
Now that I have scans of the Malayalam manuscripts I have used, I  
will try to submit them to Indoskript.
