Indology and "the disastrous  ideology of the 'pure Aryan              race'"
Dear Reinhold,
Since you have by now two times "asserted" (sic)
your questions to the list and since no reaction
came so far, since moreover my own position is
sufficiently clearly stated and
accessible(although you do have to take the
effort to search and read the articles published
in well-known places, but for anyone close to a
library a period of two years should suffice), I
think it is appropriate to stop the discussion on
this list in the present form in order not to
bore to death our fellow indology lovers. They
should at least remain sufficiently inspired to
write letters to the Berlin authorities. 
I wait for your book and write the review.
Promise. Good night.
