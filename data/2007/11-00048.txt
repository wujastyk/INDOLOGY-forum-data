Subject: pricing of offprints in European o.p. catalogs
Message-ID: <161227081557.23782.7555766209622292626.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I see a lot of offprints being offered in European antiquarian book catalogs, and for what seem to me excessive prices.  Nor do I see any pattern that they are important articles from less standard journals that might be harder to find in libraries than e.g. the Journal Asiatique or JRAS or ZDMG.  The following possible explanations occur to me.

Libraries might be less willing to allow photocopying than in the US.
They might charge a lot more per exposure.
Some countries seem less than generous in library funds, and buying an might would be cheaper than going to a distant city to consult the journal.

Any comments from European colleagues or those who've worked there?
