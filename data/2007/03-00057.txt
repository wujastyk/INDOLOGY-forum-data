Dear Steve,

Sorry, I misspelled.  It's http://used.addall.com  (2 d's not 1).  The 7 copies are still there.  One can also go to http://addall.com first and it will search in-print and then refer you to the used component (button at top).

Dear Allen,

There seems to be something wrong with the address that you supplied.  Would you please check it again and let me know if you can come up with a more correct address?
