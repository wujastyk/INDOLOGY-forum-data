I am thankful to Dr. Madhav Deshpande for the information about Neera
interpretation for Laksmi-Nrsimha.I would ask him again the meaning of
Nira in the same context.

There is a famous Nrsimha temple in Maharashtra in a town called Nira -
Narsingapur.  I don't have a map in front of me, but this town is
probably on the bank of the river Neeraa/Niraa (?).  There is indeed a
river in the region by that name.  This town is close to my family's
original home town, Tembhurni, near Solapur, and Nrsimha has been the
family deity of the Deshpande family.
