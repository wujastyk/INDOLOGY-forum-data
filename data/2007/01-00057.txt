PuTakinii
Dear List
I have a few Sanskrit letters from the town of PuTakinii by the Queen 
Indraavatii and the pundits Bhavanaatha Sharman and Bhaiyaaraama. As I 
cannot identify the queen and both pundits from the said town, could you 
tell me where PuTakiniipurii lies ? Bhavanaatha Sharman seems to be a great 
fan of Udayana and his NyaayakusumaNjali and other works, as his letter 
reveals. The addressee is RaamahRdaya, a Nepalese pundit of the 18th 
century.
