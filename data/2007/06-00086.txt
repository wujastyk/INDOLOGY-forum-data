Having now read the article pointed out by Richard, and the comments 
appended to that article, some of which question the problems with 
quality raised in the article, I wonder whether there might be some 
significant differences between the ways some materials (e.g., those 
in 'arcane' areas like 'Eastern Studies') are handled. One more 
example--if you care to, download or just look at the scan of 
Burnouf's Introduction a l'histoire du buddhisme indien. Just as a 
lark start at page 211 = the pdf's 251 (picked, I assure you, 
entirely at random) and look at a few pages. Given this kind of 
quality, why bother at all?
