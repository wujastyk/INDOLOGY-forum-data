Finding Indological full-book PDFs on Google Books
Having now read the article pointed out by Richard, and the comments 
appended to that article, some of which question the problems with 
quality raised in the article, I wonder whether there might be some 
significant differences between the ways some materials (e.g., those 
in 'arcane' areas like 'Eastern Studies') are handled. One more 
example--if you care to, download or just look at the scan of 
Burnouf's Introduction a l'histoire du buddhisme indien. Just as a 
lark start at page 211 = the pdf's 251 (picked, I assure you, 
entirely at random) and look at a few pages. Given this kind of 
quality, why bother at all?
