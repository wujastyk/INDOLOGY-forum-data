My addresses
For those who correspond with me:
Kindly note that emails sent to the address <aklujkar at unixg.ubc.ca> will no
longer reach me. 
Please use either <ashok.aklujkar at ubc.ca> or <ashok.aklujkar at gmail.com> to
contact me by email.
As I have retired from the University of British Columbia at the end of 2006
(I continue my association with the University as Professor Emeritus), it is
more convenient for me to receive non-electronic communications, printed
materials etc., at my home address:
Prof./Dr. Ashok Aklujkar
5346 Opal Place 
Richmond, B.C. 
Canada V7C 5B4  
Thanks. 
Sorry for any repetition of this message you may see on other lists.
