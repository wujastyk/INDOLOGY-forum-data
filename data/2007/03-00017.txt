Vaastusuutropani.sad
Thank you to Antonio and Michael for their responses. Michael of  
course guessed correctly why I posed the question in the first place:  
the Atharvavedic connection, and the riddle of ;Saunaka mantras in a  
commentary from Orissa. It is a curious fact that the village  
Kurumcaini, near Banki, where most if not all of the  
Vaastusuutropani.sad mss. originate, was also the place where I found  
the richest and most accessible collection of Paippalaadasa.mhitaa  
(and other Paippalaada Atharvavedic) manuscripts. Devanaagarii mss.  
from Orissa are not unknown: cf. e.g. the two 'Aa:ngirasakalpa' mss.  
from BORI (discussed by Bahulkar in ABORI 1987: the Oriya numbering  
and occasional Oriya marginalia, that confirm Orissa as these  
manuscripts' provenance, is not noticed there). Of course your notes  
would interest me, Michael.
I may take this chance to point out to those who may have some use  
for them, that several electronic versions of Atharvavedic ancillary  
texts have been put online through GRETIL over the past year:  
Gopathabraahma.na; Atharvapraaya;scittas; Ke;sava's Kau;sikapaddhati;  
Dantyo.s.thavidhi.
Best greetings,
Arlo Griffiths
