I have not read Jean Filliozat's article yet. From Professor Houben's quotes I gather 
that he saw "a gradual rise of racial theories" as a major factor in the history of 
Indology, but here, too, I cannot see that anything is said about the evidence he 
produces in support of this view.

The same applies to Sheldon Pollock's "Deep Orientalism?...". I'm prepared to 
discuss any point in Pollock's paper Professor Houben or other members of this list 
may find intellectually convincing according to the above criteria, although I cannot 
see how this could possibly contribute to the declared intention of the present 
debate in any way. In my view, the distortive and illusory claims made about the 
presumed history of "Orientalism" in general and Indology in particular are the 
single most corruptive factor for the reputation of these fields of learning. And 
wasn't that what it was all about?
