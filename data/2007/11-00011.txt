pandal
If my memory is correct, this term is also used in Bengal in reference to 
the elaborate displays which are erected each year for Durga-puja. So 
perhaps not Dravidian, or at least not exclusively so.

Dear list members,
I need some help with the etymology and usage of the term "pandal" (or
pantal, in Tamil).
"pandal" is usually rendered as "a temporary roof, a shed, booth, shelter,
or triumphal arch, esp. for temporary use (at a festival, etc.); a marquee;
a tent or booth for a marriage."
The Madras Tamil Dictionary says:
pantalpirittal the ceremony of removing the pandal erected for marriage, 
etc.
pantalvaricai money presented to the bride and bridegroom at the marriage
