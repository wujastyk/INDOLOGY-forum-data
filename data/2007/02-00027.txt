hospitals (fwd)
If you or anyone you know is working on the history of hospitals in Asia, 
could you get in touch with me?  A colleagues is working on a project on 
this (see below).
Many thanks,
Dominik
RE: hospitals
Dear Dominik
I am planning an edited collection based upon an expanded version of the 
conference proceedings. As I mentioned in an earlier e-mail to you, I was 
somewhat disappointed that there were no proposals from people working on 
hospitals in either China, Sri Lanka or India (from any historical period). 
Would you be able to recommend any scholars to me, who are working in these 
areas on topics such as architecture and landscapes, art and material culture, 
music and ritual and treatment and medicines. Any advice that you could give me 
would be most gratefully received.
best wishes
