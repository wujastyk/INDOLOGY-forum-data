XVIIth century use of devanaagarii script in Kerala by Gauda              Sarasvata Brahmins
Dear list,
I apologize for giving myself the answer to what could have been seen 
as something surprizing (at least to me). Thanks to a very 
interesting comment given off-list by Thennilapuram Mahadevan, we 
have indeed to assume that  "Ranga Botto, Vinaique Pandito & Apu 
Botto, omnes tres de Natione & Religione Bramanas & Gymnosophistae 
antiqui" were "Northern" Gauda Sarasvata Brahmins (about which see 
the discussion with Frank Conlon, Frits Staal etc. in the 
Indology-archives of the 24th of November 2004 and after), which 
gives an supplementary testimony of their historical links with the 
Portuguese power on the West Coast (and their still cultural 
prevalence thereafter under the Dutch dominion).
Best regards,
Christophe Vielle
