AW: bhAgavatapurANa - translation question - what does zUla              mean?
Dear colleagues,
It is most distressing to see that van Buitenen so flagrantly  
violates [my] translation rule number 1, which is 'if it sounds  
absurd, it is wrong'. Tagare's translation seems more accurate,  
although aTTa could be rendered as markets rather than food. So the  
meaning will then be that in Kali yuga there is rampant capitalism,  
peddling of Vedas at the crossroads, and the women are harlots. At  
least that makes sense.
Clearly, a semantic study of the the word zUla is in order.
