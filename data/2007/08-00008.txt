sad news
  Dear Colleagues,
It is with deep sorrow that I must inform you that our colleague and 
friend, Dr Primoz Pecenko, suddenly passed away last night.
Our deepest sympathy and thoughts are with Tamara and Alexander at this 
time.
I shall hope to convey to you information about arrangements as details 
come to hand.
Kind Regards,
Richard
