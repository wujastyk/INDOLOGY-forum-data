  Dear Colleagues,
 

It is with deep sorrow that I must inform you that our colleague and 
friend, Dr Primoz Pecenko, suddenly passed away last night.

 

Our deepest sympathy and thoughts are with Tamara and Alexander at this 
time.

 

I shall hope to convey to you information about arrangements as details 
come to hand.

 

Kind Regards,

Richard
