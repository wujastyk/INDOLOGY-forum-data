Dear members of the list,

Prof. Houben wrote in his last email (Fri, 5 Jan 2007 10:13:01 -0800)
to this list:

I cannot see what this remark should mean. Anyway, I find it better  
not to remain silent any longer, esp., as I am one of the co-editors  
of the series, in which the Gustav Roth Festschrift and Reinhold  
Gr?nendahl's article appeared. I am limiting myself just to a few  
points.

As for the statement,

Any careful reader of Reinhold Gr?nendahl's article in the Gustav Roth  
Festschrift (2006) will be surprised at this insinuation, especially  
in the case of W?st. In his own words Gr?nendahl (2006: 212) says:  
"Hier erkennt man deutlich die Handschrift W?sts, dessen erkl?rtes  
Ziel es war, das durchweg philologisch gepr?gte Fach in eine von  
v?lkischer Ideologie bestimmte Handlangert?tigkeit umzudefinieren."  
("Here one clearly recognizes W?ste's signature whose explicit aim was  
to redefine the completely philogically oriented discipline as an  
activity that is subsidiary to 'v?lkisch' ideology".)

Or, what should the question of Frauwallner's Austrian nationality suggest?
Again, in Gr?nendahl's own words (2006: 207, n. 46): "Der Hinweis auf
die Tatsache, da? Frauwallner ?sterreicher war, soll  
selbstverst?ndlich nicht dazu dienen, die Verantwortung f?r dessen  
Thesen etwa auf eine '?sterreichische Indologie' abzuw?lzen [...];  
Frauwallner selbst [stellt] sich nachdr?cklich in die Tradition einer  
'deutschen Indologie". ("The reference to the fact that Frauwallner  
was Austrian should not in any way at all be used to shift the  
responsibility of his [Frauwallner's] theses, say, onto an 'Austrian  
Indology' [...]; Frauwallner [puts] himself emphatically in the  
tradition of a 'German Indology'.")

I am looking forward to _evidence_  with regard to Dr Gr?nendahl's  
questions instead of, I think, giving mere allegations.

With kind regards,
Roland Steiner
