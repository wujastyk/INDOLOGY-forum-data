Sievers and W?st were among the highest-ranking officers of the Ahnenerbe (after 
Heinrich Himmler), and without knowing the details of their meeting in Munich, I 
would assume that Sievers consulted W?st in this capacity, not as an indologist. As 
far as I know, there were not Indologists in the "Hedin-Institut f?r Innerasien und 
Expeditionen" (Munich), founded as late as 16.1.1943 and directed by Ernst 
Sch?fer. It operated largely independently, but with organizational ties to the 
Ahnenerbe, Munich University and the ministry in charge. (Helmut Hoffmann joined 
as a Tibetologist; for details see Michael H. Kater, Das Ahnenerbe, 2001:213 and 
passim).
More to the point, I'm not aware that the "ideology of the 'pure Aryan race'" occupied 
the Hedin-Institut in any way, and having been founded that late, what influence 
could it have had on that ideology?
As far as I remember, evidence of Hauer's anti-semitic conviction is indirect (letters 
etc.), and not documented in his publications. But I would have to look that up. 
Anyway, I'm not aware that he propagated the "ideology of the 'pure Aryan race'", 
but would have to check that, too.
