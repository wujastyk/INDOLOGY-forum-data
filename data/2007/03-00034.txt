nimittasaptamii
Dear Colleagues,
In the Pratiityasamutpaadavyaakhyaa Vasubandhu quotes the famous Mahaabhaashya
verse illustrating nimittasaptamii (2.3.36 carmani dviipinam hanti ...) with an
interesting variant in paada d: "the adulterer is killed because of a
woman/wife" (bud med phyir ni byi pho bsad). Does anyone know a Sanskrit source
with this variant?
Many thanks in advance and best wishes,
Eli Franco
