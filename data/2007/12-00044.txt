Dear  Asko,

Due to prospective government's decision, we already face difficult time 
for research in France, especially at CNRS.

You will find an e-petition in English, from "Sauvons la Recherche" 
Association, proposing an alternative reform of the French higher education 
and research system on the following WEB site :

http://www.sauvonslarecherche.fr/spip.php?article1795

We need many international signatures from researchers, to help us build 
pressure on the French Government in order to have better conditions for 
discussion of an alternative reform.

To sign the petition you must go on the following page, with the text in
French :

http://www.sauvonslarecherche.fr/spip.php?article1772

on the right side of that page
you can enter your Name, Departement, e-mail etc.
Then press the button called "valider".

You will receive after a short while a e-mail of "Sauvons la recherche"
Association saying that you signed the petition.

Please sign this e-petition as and send it as soon as possible  to other 
researchers at the Smithsonian and other American Departments and 
Universities. This is the beginning of our action but again, your help is 
needed from the beginning.

Regards
Dr Sophie M?ry
