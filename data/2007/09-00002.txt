avagraha in Malayalam Manuscript
In several hundred Sanskrit and Prakrit manuscripts written in Malayalam
script dealing with theatre and drama we never came across a sign like
avagraha. In case anyone has a sample for an avagraha we would be also very
keen to get an image plus reference.
Best wishes,
