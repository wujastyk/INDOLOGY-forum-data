hospitals (fwd)
Please ask your colleague to see my study:
 Kirkpatrick, Joanna. The Sociology of an Indian Hospital Ward. South Asia 
Books, 1980. It was the first published study of social and symbolic 
interaction in a hospital in India (in Ludhiana, Panjab), far as I know. The 
research period was 1965-66.
