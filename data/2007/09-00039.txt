Use of Devanagari for Sanskrit
Dear George Heart
I cannot speak broadly to the phenomenon, but I can note the patterns that
we find in MSS of the Shiva Purana in particular. The older MSS I examined
at the University of Madras were all Sanskrit-Telugu (ca. 17-19th c.),
whereas the Devanagari MSS at the Adyar library were typically much newer.
Hope that helps,
Best Wishes,
Benjamin Fleming
