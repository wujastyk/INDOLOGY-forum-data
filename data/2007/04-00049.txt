gItA narrated by Ziva for RAmacandra
The book "GItAs in the MahAbhArata and the PurANas" by Ratnam Nilakanthan (Delhi: Nag Publishers, 1989) mentions no GItA in the Shiva Purana, but several times refers to the ZivagItA which is a sermon preached by Shiva to Rama; but the Shivagita is a part of the *Padma* Purana!
