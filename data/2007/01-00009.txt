Aw: Making the Argument for Sanskrit
 a) Our knowledge of "the Indian culture", which is strongly dependent on Sanskrit sources, is still in its infancy. Thousands of texts are not yet published, and millions of manuscripts wait to be collated. We need much more?not less?specialists to work on these sources.
b) The present position of Indology as an academic field located at the outskirts of the humanities is not a natural one. It is the result of the eurocentric attitude which governed Western university politics throughout their history. The relative weakness of Indology in terms of funding is not to be taken as a sign for a lack of importance, it is a sign for the need of improvement.
