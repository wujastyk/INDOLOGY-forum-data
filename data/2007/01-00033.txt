Only a few years ago, Professor Houben advanced a similar argument when he 
claimed that "German indology" was in some way involved in "the disastrous 
ideology of the 'pure Aryan race'". 
(for an online version of his paper see:
http://www.iias.nl/iiasn/iiasn7/south/houben.html)
However, at closer inspection, "the volumes 92-98 (1938-44) and 99 (1945-49) of 
the 'Zeitschrift der deutschen morgenl?ndischen Gesellschaft'" he draws on in 
support say nothing of the kind, as I have tried to show in a recent paper. Of course, 
Professor Houben is free to ignore my paper, but should he consider taking up the 
issue in the present context, I should like to ask what kind of evidence he intends to 
produce this time. Two criteria would be very helpful: 1) that the evidence is 
concrete and verifiable by book, chapter and verse; 2) that it is relevant to the 
context.
