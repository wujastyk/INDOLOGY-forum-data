Hindu critiques of astrology / jyotiSa
Tim,
There is a very interesting dissertation that should be of immediate  
interest (I don't know if it ever became a book):
Barry Steven Friedman, "Negotiating Destiny:  The Astrologer and His  
Art in Bengali Cultural History" (PhD Dissertation, The University of  
Chicago, 1986).
Cheers,
Tony K. Stewart
