Enough is enough ! (Re: A question concerning the proposal to              shut down the previous thread
It is instructive to see how the attempt is choked to conduct a  
scholarly discussion here. The arguments for shutting down the thread  
are as follows:
1. The subject has been sufficiently explored. [Actually, the  
discussion has not even started.]
2. A topic dealing with the history of Indology (entitled "aspects of the
history of the Third Reich") has nothing to do with issues and ideas  
pertaining
to classical Indian studies.
3a. It is not possible to discuss this topic simultaneously with the  
topic: "HOW TO SALVAGE SANSKRIT IN BERLIN?" in two different threads  
on the same list.
3b. List-members are kept away from devoting energy to the "Berlin-crisis".
4. One should only deal with questions whose clarifications cannot  
wait for a few new years.
Or, to put it summarily in simple words: Enough is enough!
With kind regards,
Roland Steimer
