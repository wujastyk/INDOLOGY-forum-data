Kalpabheda
Dear Indologists,
Would any of you know if anyone has written on the idea of kalpabheda that is used in the tradition of puranic hermeneutics to explain contradictions in the puranas?  I have searched a bit, but have thus far only found the term mentioned in Jiva Gosvamin's Brhatvaisnavatosani commentary on Bhagavatapurana 10.33.26.  The idea must be much older than Jiva Gosvamin, though.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Sincerely,
Toke Lindegaard Knudsen
