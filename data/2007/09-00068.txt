Using Devanagari for Sanskrit
Sorry for the late reply to this thread. The word devanagari
occurs twice in the Shahnameh, a source for many early
Orientalists. No other names of Indian scripts are mentioned
in that early 11th century text. It's possible that the
Persian perspective on devanagari as an "all-India" script
contributed to the politics of making it seem transregional.
