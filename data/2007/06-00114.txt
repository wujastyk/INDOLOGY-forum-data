I'd be happy to send you a copy of the text. Its a scan from a
photocopy, inverse, white text, black ground, hardly archival quality
but readable. Currently its a 12MB multi-page tiff file, though if
you'd prefer this could be converted to a pdf version, if I can
remember how. Probably easiest to put it on my site but up to you.
I really have posted quite enough over the past day or two so if others
want a copy please drop me a line off list.
Kind regards,
 Richard
