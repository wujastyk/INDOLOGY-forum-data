Harry,

Would you like a scan of a couple of single sheets I have in my personal collection that seem to be of cryptographic scripts?

this plan was there from the outset and a version with just the query 
and results pages is in the making. The very flexible map will probably 
be lost on the way as certainly will the OCR feature, i.e. the 
possibility for you to draw the outline of a character you have in a ms. 
and have IndoSript check for cognates.
Unfortunately, funding has come to a close and the brain behind all this 
programming, Oliver Hellwig, has lots of other projects running.
I take this opportunity to thank Gudrun Melzer and Michael Hahn for 
material they have sent to be included in the next version of the brahmi 
database, which already now is considerably larger than the first trial 
version. Our invitation to send us interesting material for inclusion is 
a steady one: we need good scans and a transcription if the text is 
little known.
H. Falk
