Maybe T. Ganapati Sastri proposes some dating for 
the Prapa?cah.rdaya in his edition (TSS no. 45). 
I once noted that Winternitz in his Catalogue of 
South Indian Sanskrit Manuscripts in the RAS 
(Wish no. 107) describes it as ?an admirable 
cyclopaedia of modern works of science?.
With best wishes,
