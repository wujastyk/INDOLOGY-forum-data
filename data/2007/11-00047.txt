asva sastra
friends,
My friend Dr. Sandeep Joshi JRRSU is working on the asva sastra. He is
editing the text of Asva sastra earlier published in Sarasvati mahal. but
the text is currupt and difficult to reconstruct. there is on info on author
etc.
He wants to know whether there are early writings on this subject. One
reference is "Asva-sastra or the science of the horse"  of Hemasuri eds. V.
J. A. and V. Krishnasamy  1928. Even we are finding it dificult to trace
this book. we want some information.
thanks in advance.
