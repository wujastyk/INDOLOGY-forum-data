Use of Devanagari for Sanskrit
What George says about South Indian scripts goes for Bengali script as 
well. I have often wondered why early British Orientalists in Calcutta 
adopted - and propagated - Devanagari in preference to Bengali script, 
which was - and to a large extent continues to be - the vehicle of 
choice for Sanskrit texts in Bengal. For some texts of proven Bengali 
provenance, the division between late 18th and early 19th century 
manuscripts  in traditional oblong loose-leaf format in Bengali script 
for indigenous patrons, and manuscripts in book-style format and 
Devanagari script for Western Orientalists is stark. A perhaps not 
unrelated question is why Orientalists such as Charles Wilkins and 
Francis Wilford sought to go to Banaras to pursue study and research in 
Sanskrit when there was a still  thriving Bengali tradition of Sanskrit 
studies in Nadiya (Navadvipa), if not in Calcutta. Rosane Rocher
