[Indo-Eurasia] **The Farmer-Sproat-Witzel Model
Dear Indologists,
Let me explain why this post from me was sent to the Indology list.  I. 
Mahadevan has recently published an argument against the view of Farmer, 
Sproat & Witzel that the signs of the IVC are not a script.  While I 
myself am not persuaded by Mahadevan's argument, I think that his 
argument should be considered seriously, since, as we alll know,  he is 
a good scholar who has already made significant contributions to 
Indology.  He deserves to be listened to, in his own words.
He has recently been invited by Farmer et al., to debate with them about 
this matter.  Farmer et al. propose to offer him an open medium where 
this matter could be discussed rationally and openly.  But I doubt that 
this proposal should be taken seriously, and I would recommend to 
Mahadevan that he should avoid this poisoned invitation.
The Farmer list is in fact not a typical academic research list.  It is 
a list devoted to one person's research interests, encouraged by friends 
and research money from exploitable ideologues.  Look at at  his 
excessive talk of prize money, offered to those that please him and his 
money-sources.   This is not scholarship.  It is a game of money-gathering.
Look, when I sent my earlier post to this list, I told you all to expect 
that a discussion with Farmer would amount to little more than a brief 
note from some list member, framed by a Farmer moderator's note and 
enclosed by a Farmer refutation. Instead, what we got  from him in this 
case was a tell-tale silence.
In such an environment, only one person wins the debate, and his name is 
always Steve Farmer.
Well, as long as I can speak to you directly, this fraud will not go by 
unnoticed.
