Dear Professor Houben,

Just a quick note.

The fate of Moritz Spitzer in post-WW2 Israel has been partially
recounted by Eli Franco in his Introduction to Volume 1 of "The
Spitzer Manuscript - The Oldest Philosophical Manuscript in Sanskrit".
Beitr?ge zur Kultur- und Geistesgeschichte Asiens 43. ?sterreichischen
Akademie der Wissenschaften, philosophisch-historische Klasse, Wien
(2004).

Kind regards,

Antonio Ferreira-Jardim

... "Apart from the Indologists victimized by the "aryan paragraphs"
whether as Jews themselves or because they were married to Jews
(including Betty Heimann [emigrated], Walter Neisser [suicide, 1941],
Walter Ruben [emigrated], Isidore Scheftelowitz [emigrated], Richard
Simon, [died 1934], Moritz Spitzer [fate unknown], Otto Stein [died in
Lodz Ghetto, 1942], Otto Strauss [died in flight in Holland, 1940],
Heinrich Zimmer [emigrated]), none publicly opposed the regime, or
left the country."
