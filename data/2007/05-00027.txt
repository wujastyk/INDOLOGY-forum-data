Essential Reading on Nazi-time European Indology (I)
Dear Professor Houben,
Just a quick note.
The fate of Moritz Spitzer in post-WW2 Israel has been partially
recounted by Eli Franco in his Introduction to Volume 1 of "The
Spitzer Manuscript - The Oldest Philosophical Manuscript in Sanskrit".

(2004).
Kind regards,
