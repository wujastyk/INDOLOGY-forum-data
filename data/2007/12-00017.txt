Sanskrit Software
Dear Prof. dehejia,
The software 'Itranslator' works very well for Sanskrit language in devanagari and transliteration. Another programme called 'MikeTex' which is most used by western scholars are one of the advance programmes for convertion of Devanagari and roman transliteration. Hope it will help.
With best regards

Sanskrit Software
Friends:
I have had an inquiry from a Vedic scholar in California and he writes:
"I would like to create a professional software package, an 'add-on' that operates directly within Microsoft Office. Such software would give users a common platform for efficiently typing Sanskrit from a Romanized (English) keyboard directly into MSWord. Users would be able to do so in Devanagari or transliteration, or by toggling from one to the other. My hope is to distribute such a package free of cost over the internet and, in doing so, create a common platform for all who create full or part-Sanskrit documents, publish them, or simply use them. Academic or student, mystic or pragmatist, Westerner or Indian, if someone has MSWord, they'll be able to use what I envision. "
Does anyone know if this exists?  If not what shall I tell him. He seems sincere.
Regards and Season's Greetings.
