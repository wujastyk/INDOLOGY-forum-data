British Library cuts
Dear Colleagues:
Please take a moment to read the following articles about proposed  
cuts to the British Library (services, collections) and the proposed  
introduction of reader fees.
Apologies for any cross listings.  And perhaps some of our UK  
colleagues can shed additional light on the subject and suggest an  
appropriate response.
