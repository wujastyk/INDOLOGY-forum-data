Extract from publisher's blurb:
"In this book, McComas Taylor looks at the discourses that give shape 
and structure to the fall of the indigo jackal and the other tales 
within the /Pancatantra./ The work?s fictional metasociety of animals, 
kings, and laundrymen are divided according to their /jati,/ or ?kind.? 
This discourse of caste holds that individuals? essential natures, 
statuses, and social circles are all determined by their birth. Taylor 
applies contemporary critical theory developed by Foucault, Bourdieu, 
Barthes, and others to show how these ideas are related to other 
Sanskritic master-texts, and describes the ?regime of truth? that 
provides validation for the discourse of division."
