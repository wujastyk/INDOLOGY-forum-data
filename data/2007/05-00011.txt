Commentaries on Rasaratnasamuccaya
If I remember correctly Anandashrama also published a commentary to this
text mentioned by Dom under a separate title, but I don't have it handy to
check the details. Perhaps someone else has the specifics.

PS The Anandashrama edition of the RRS is digitized and available from the 
DLI (www.dli.ernet.in).  It's a careful edition, done by V K Bapat and M C 
Apte in Pune in "saalivaahana"saka 1812 (+78 = 1890).  Without commentary, 
but with a series of interesting drawings at the end of the book.
