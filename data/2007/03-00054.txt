Zitat von Justin Meiland <jmeiland at YAHOO.COM>:

> Dear Colleagues,

> I am trying to collect together secondary literature on Aryashura's

> Does anyone have any recommendations?

> While I do have an interest in Jatakamalas by other authors and in the
> concept of Jatakamala as a genre (e.g. the work of Michael Hahn on
> Haribhatta and Gopadatta), I am particularly seeking out studies on
> Aryashura. (Works such as Khoroche's notes towards a critical edition
> and Schlingloff's discussion of Ajanta and the Jatakamala are already
> familiar to me.)
