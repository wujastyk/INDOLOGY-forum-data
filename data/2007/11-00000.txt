Soteriology of universals
Many thanks to all who replied to my query. Your responses have  
helped confirm that, while it has become a commonplace to note the  
similarities in the way universals were espoused in Nyaaya-VaizeSika  
and in Plato, there are fundamentally important differences that such  
comparative philosophy really ought to elucidate. This is  
particularly noteworthy since the differences emerge when the issue  
of soteriology and the transmigration of souls/selves is addressed.
With best wishes to all,
Will
