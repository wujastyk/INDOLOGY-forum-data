palm leaf manuscript: script & identification?
Dear colleagues,
a colleague from NY is seeking assistance in identifying a 215-page palm
leaf manuscript. He is unsure of the language, the script, the age and the
text of the mss, and I would like to provide any possible pointers. An
image of one page of the manuscript is available online at:

One colleague guessed it was a South Indian script, but another discounted
that theory and wondered if it was some Bengali or Oriya script. I also
wonder if it could be Southeast Asian. Advice anyone?
Many thanks,
David Magier
