Boehtlingk's Paninis Grammatik
Thanks, Madhav.  That brings up a page that gives me the bibliographical 
details of the 1887 edition, but that's all.  No buttons to click, no 
"download" possibilities.  There are links to shops and libraries, but no 
download.
I guess the "universal library" isn't so universal.
