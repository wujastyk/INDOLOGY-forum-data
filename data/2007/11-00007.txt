pandal
Dear list members,
I need some help with the etymology and usage of the term ?pandal? (or
pantal, in Tamil).
?pandal? is usually rendered as ?a temporary roof, a shed, booth, shelter,
or triumphal arch, esp. for temporary use (at a festival, etc.); a marquee;
a tent or booth for a marriage.?
The Madras Tamil Dictionary says:
pantalpirittal the ceremony of removing the pandal erected for marriage, etc. 
pantalvaricai money presented to the bride and bridegroom at the marriage pandal
