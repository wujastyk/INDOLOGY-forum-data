Mac-Devanagari
The OS X version of Nisus Writer Pro is an extremely good word  
processor and works well with unicode (both Devanagari and Tamil are  
built-in to Leopard and Tiger).  I think the new Word for Mac coming  
out in January may not handle unicode properly -- we'll see.  Nisus  
reads and writes Word files and uses rtf as its default format.   
TextEdit (which is free and also comes with the OS) also works well  
with unicode.  But of course TextEdit won't do footnotes and the  
like.  George Hart
