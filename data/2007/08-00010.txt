[Fwd: ORIENT: Primoz Pecenko]
Dear Colleagues
Please find attached an obituary for our dear friend and colleague 
Primoz Pecenko.
Primoz suffered a massive heart attack while walking his dog with his 
wife Tamara and son Alexander (whom we all remember fondly from 
Edinburgh) one evening last week. He died two days before his 60th birthday.
Yours
McComas
