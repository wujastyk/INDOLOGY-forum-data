[For the prehistory of this controversy see the INDOLOGY archives of 
January 2007 at http://listserv.liv.ac.uk/archives/indology.html,
s.v. "Indology and the disastrous ideology of the 'pure Aryan race'",

Jan Houben has a serious problem, and in deflecting from it, his latest 
postings bring it out even more clearly. In his 1995 report he has made a 
claim which he could not prove then, and has been unable to prove 
since, viz., that there were "positive relations which some indologists at 
least maintained with the German government and its disastrous 
ideology of the 'pure Aryan race' before and during the period of the 
Second World War period" (Houben 1995)
[NOTE: It is here where I picked up Houben's phrase "some indologists 
at least"; cf. his last posting.]

His only attempt to produce primary evidence of sorts was a hint at 
"selected articles and notices of the volumes 92-98 (1938-44) and 99 
(1945-49) of the Zeitschrift f?r die Deutsche Morgenl?ndische 
Gesellschaft" [sic]. As I have shown in an article for the Festschrift 
Gustav Roth (2006), the ZDMG yields virtually no evidence that could 
support Houben's claim, and additional hints he came up with in January 
have done nothing to help him out of that problem (cf. my above-
mentioned assessment). 

If his suggestive hint at the ZDMG can count as an original idea, it would 
be the only one Houben could take credit for. As his recent postings 
show once again, all his other pronouncements on "German indology" 
etc. merely mirror secondary sources - which may, or may not, support 
Houben's 1995 claim (a point to be examined elsewhere). In my view, 
this fully qualifies Houben for the term I chose in my article, viz., 
"Epigone" (Duden: "Nachahmer, ohne eigene Ideen" = echo/copier, 
without own ideas).

Houben's primary source of inspiration is Sheldon Pollock's 1993 article 
"Deep Orientalism? ...", designed to implicate "German indology" in the 
National Socialist ideology, and the crimes committed in its wake. Here 
are Pollock's claims in a nutshell:

"The case of German Indology, a dominant form of European 
orientalism, leads us to ask whether orientalism cannot be as powerfully 
understood with reference to the national political culture within which it 
is practiced as to the colony toward which it is directed (...). We usually 
imagine its vector as directed outward - toward the colonization and 
domination of Asia; in the case of German Indology we might conceive 
of it as potentially directed inward - toward the colonization and 
domination of Europe itself" (Pollock 1993:76f.).

Pollock's "outward-vector" stance clearly is a carbon copy of Edward's 
Said's "Orientalism" (1978), and three titles by Said feature in Pollock's 
bibliography, all of which goes to show that Pollock's theorizing is base 
on Said's - and that's how this "dead horse" found its way into my article. 
Some, like Houben, may meanwhile find it opportune to publicly distance 
themselves from Said, but implicitly, their own theorizing holds on to 
Said's baseless tenets just the same.

Now on to Pollock's "inward vector":
"In German Indology of the NS era, a largely nonscholarly mystical 
nativism deriving ultimately from a mixture of romanticism and 
protonationalism merged with that objectivism of Wissenschaft earlier 
described, and together they fostered the ultimate 'orientalist' project, the 
legitimation of genocide" (Pollock 1993:96).

This is the central theme of Pollock's article, from which I derived the title 
for mine, "Von der Indologie zum V?lkermord : Die
