AW: Soteriology of universals
Eli,
That's interesting.  Can you provide a citation 
for that argument (the 
_Jnanasrimitra-nibandhavali_ (Patna, 1959), I 
assume)?
    Of course, once you start talking about the 
perspective of an omniscient consciousness, it's 
a whole different affair.
best,
Paul Hackett
