I support George Hart's point of view here. The strongest argument for
Sanskrit is the fact that the language is fundamental to the understanding
of India's cultural and religious tradition, combined with the fact that
India is an emerging global power with a vast economic, military and
political potential. Understanding India is important, not simply for
intellectual and philosophical reasons, although they are important enough,
but because it is materially important for ourself. Trying to deal with
societies which we don't understand can easily set us on the road to
perdition, as we have seen clearly during the last few years.
