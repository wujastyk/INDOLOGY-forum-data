Vasubandhu's Vimsatika with its Vrttii in Sanskrit
Greetings All:
	Does anyone have  Vasubandhu's Vimsatika with its Vrttii in  
Sanskrit  handy? I've inter-library loaned it and it seems to be  
taking more time than I had anticipated. I had planned to read it in  
my Sanskrit class next week so time is of the essence. If someone has  
it as a PDF (or could make it into a PDF) I would be much obliged if  
I could get a copy.
	Sorry about the multiple posting.
Thanks in advance,
Deepak
