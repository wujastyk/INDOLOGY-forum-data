avagraha in Malayalam Manuscript
Very interesting. It could be useful to know the 
origin of the KUML L.662 mss. and find other 
examples to check if it comes from the same 
area/milieu as Parpola's ms. from the 
NellikkaaTTu Mana. It could be a local or 
temporally limited use in the history of 
Malayalam scipt.
With best wishes,
