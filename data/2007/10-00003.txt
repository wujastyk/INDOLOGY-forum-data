journal rankings
Thank you to those who responded to my posting regarding journal
rankings. 
As all of you noted, such a ranking system is seriously flawed. However,
this is being introduced in Australia and we have to respond and
influence the outcome. We will resister our concerns and attempt to
ensure that the "lists" are as comprehensive and as "reasonable" as
possible (although I know this will have many shortcomings). For this
purpose, if any of you have links to such documents already in place
(e.g. the Norwegian one mentioned by Lars), that would be helpful.
