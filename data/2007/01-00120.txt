Patrick,

this is the Pali  Neranjanaa, where you can find many more detail 
(Vinaya I 1 sqq; see details in Malalasekara's Dictionary of Pali 
Proper Names.  Several (pseudo-)etymologies of the name.

Identified with the modern Niilaajanaa (N?l?jan?), which originates in 
Harzaribhagh, joins the Mohanaa, to form the river Phalgu. 
(Cunningham's Ancient Geography of India, p. 524, etc etc.)

Cheers,

Michael
