Commentaries on Rasaratnasamuccaya
Respected members of the list,
I'd like to ask your help in a question concerning commentaries on the 
Rasaratnasamuccaya, ascribed to one Vaagbha.ta:
Apparently there are two commentaries, one "Bodhinii" and one ".Tiikaa". 
On the other hand I have two names (or honorary titles) connected with these 
commentaries, viz., Aashubodhavidyaabhuu.sa.na and Nityabodhavidyaaratna.
I have no access to a printed edition including these commentaries, and the 
catalogues at my disposal do not indicate the exact relation between the two names 
and the said commentaries. Would someone be so kind as to tell me who wrote 
which?
Many thanks in advance.
Reinhold Gr?nendahl
