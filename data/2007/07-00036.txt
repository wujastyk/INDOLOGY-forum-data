Unicode font
all the keystrokes are mapped out and ready-made for Windows, Mac, and 
Linux.  They are downloadable from the same web page from which you 
(presumably) got the font itself.  See
   http://bombay.indology.info
NB everyone: the fonts have changed their names, after a friendly 
complaing about trademarks from the foundry that "owns" the names "Times" 
etc.  The fonts themselves haven't changed, and there is no technical 
reason for getting the newly named ones.
As ever, enormous thanks to John Smith for his selfless work in making all 
this software so excellent, and so free.
