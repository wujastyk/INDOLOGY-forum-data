The Buddha meets Holger Danske
At the very end of a lengthy interview
(http://www.sappho.dk/Den%20loebende/nydahl.html)
(http://gatesofvienna.blogspot.com/2007/04/buddha-meets-holger-danske.html)
Ole Nydahl drops a hint about Danish
Buddhist resistance to Islam under the
headline "Embarrasing Pacifism, Why
didn't the Buddhists fight back?",
e.g.:
"I really like the East Tibetans ? the
Kampas ? proud, Viking-like warriors who
kept the Chinese and other foes out all
through that time.?
Q: We could use a bit of their spirit in
contemporary Denmark.
?We have it. Several of my students have
joined the National Guard. That?s a good
place for young people if they feel that
our country is in danger."
Is there something in that, or nothing
behind it? Any hard facts or some
reliable background information
available from our Scandinavian
colleagues?
Thanks,
