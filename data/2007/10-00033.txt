It certainly appears in Krttibasa's Bengali Ramayana.

I will send you a translation of the passage (which appears in  
partial translation in " Tony K. Stewart and Edward C. Dimock, Jr.,  
?K?ttib?sa?s Apophatic Critique of R?ma?s Kingship? in  
Questioning R?m?ya?as, edited by Paula Richman (New Delhi:  Oxford  
University Press, 2000, 243-64; Simultaneous release:  Berkeley, CA:   
University of California Press, 2001)--but I don't have the precise  
page numbers in front of me.

cheers,
