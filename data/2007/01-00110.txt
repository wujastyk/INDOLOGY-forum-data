Here it could be pointed out to the Berlin authorities that better job opportunities 
may have caused Oppenheimer to pursue a career in indology instead of 
constructing a weapon of mass destruction, the effects of which Berlin escaped only 
narrowly. (Sadly, this cannot be said for the citizens of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.)


NOTE:
Speculations to the effect  that it may have been Oppenheimer's brush with 
indology, or his familiarity with the Bhagavadgita (which Heinrich Himmler also was 
familiar with, by the way), that triggered him to construct the atom bomb can be 
discarded as absurd fabrications, attributable to ignorance, charlatanry, or worse.
