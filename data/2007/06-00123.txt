Dear all,

A very nice, clear colour scan of Burnouf's Histoire is available
here: http://www.archive.org/details/introductionlh00burnuoft which
also lists a number of download options.

The scans available from archive.org seem to be sourced from a number
of places including DLI of varying qualities. The clear advantage
archive.org offers is the choice of download options.

On another forum Daniel Stender from Uni Bonn listed the following
working inventory of scanned repositories (excluding the DLI):

http://www.uni-bonn.de/~uzstzm/
http://www.chaf.lib.latrobe.edu.au/dcd/default.htm
http://historical.library.cornell.edu/cdl/about.html
http://dsal.uchicago.edu/books/
http://gallica.bnf.fr/
http://www.archive.org/index.php
http://www.lirs.ru/do/trans-lanka.html

Another one I know of is:

http://nagarjuna.onlinestoragesolution.com/boodist

It is worth recognising that there are thriving (informal) online
forums in existence with the purpose of exchanging scans of
indological publications in various languages. However, in the
interests of not offending those sensitive to copyright issues, I will
not post them here.

Kind regards,
