[Y-Indology] Berlin Indology (2)
Dear Harry,
 Enclosed please find a copy of my letter sent today.
 With best regards,

  I am writing this letter in order to express my deep concern in regards to 
the plan of closing down the Classical Indian Studies program at your 
university. I would not repeat the known facts of the long and glorious 
history of 186 years of first class Indological research in Berlin. I would 
also avoid mentioning the important contribution of the German Indologists 
to the field worldwide. What I would like to very briefly state, is that I 
believe that the field of classical Indology is not only to contribute to 
the study of the past, rather, it has an important role to play in the 
future, too. I am an Indologist living in Israel, and am planning to enter 
the emerging field of peace studies; to my mind, Sanskrit literature will 
gradually come to occupy a major place as a rich source of ideas for the 
construction of theories in the area of Global Nonviolence and hence, 
another aspect of its importance. I hope that this considered, it will help 
the authorities overcome the difficulties, and allow Classical Indological 
Studies to continue in Berlin.
 Respectfully,
