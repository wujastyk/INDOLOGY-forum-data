Dear Harry,

 Enclosed please find a copy of my letter sent today.

 With best regards,
                                 Ithamar

  Department of Indian Philology

  Berlin


  I am writing this letter in order to express my deep concern in regards to 
the plan of closing down the Classical Indian Studies program at your 
university. I would not repeat the known facts of the long and glorious 
history of 186 years of first class Indological research in Berlin. I would 
also avoid mentioning the important contribution of the German Indologists 
to the field worldwide. What I would like to very briefly state, is that I 
believe that the field of classical Indology is not only to contribute to 
the study of the past, rather, it has an important role to play in the 
future, too. I am an Indologist living in Israel, and am planning to enter 
the emerging field of peace studies; to my mind, Sanskrit literature will 
gradually come to occupy a major place as a rich source of ideas for the 
construction of theories in the area of Global Nonviolence and hence, 
another aspect of its importance. I hope that this considered, it will help 
the authorities overcome the difficulties, and allow Classical Indological 
Studies to continue in Berlin.


 Respectfully,

 Ithamar Theodor

>>
>> To whom it may concern:
>>
>> A few days weeks we have learned, worldwide, that Indian Studies in 
>> Berlin are to be abolished. I therefore write to you to request to 
>> preserve the world famous Institute of Indology.
>>
>> This does not only concern modern South Asian Studies, that still are 
>> well represented, but also ?Classical Indology? or ?Indian Philology?.
>>
>> Classical Indian Philology has existed at Berlin since 1821, and the 
>> discipline has been continued at Humboldt University even after 1945 by 
>> Professors Ruben and Morgenroth, as well as at the new institute of the 
>> Freie Universitaet (Prof.s Bruhn and Falk). Indology prominently deals 
>> with the indigenous weltanschauung, religion and history of thought, as 
>> they are represented in Sanskrit and other texts. Without this kind of 
>> background modern India cannot be understood.
>>
>> The study of the Sanskrit language, that was one of the official 
>> languages in India until 1835, is essential for any understanding of the 
>> immense number of Indian texts, from c. 1500 BCE until today, for example 
>> in fields such as traditional Indian medicine (Ayurveda) or indigenous 
>> Indian linguistics (Panini), a field that has supplied important stimuli 
>> to western linguistics.
>>
>> As is obvious even from this minimal discussion, modern India can only be 
>> understood -- just as any other important civilization ? if one studies 
>> its foundational texts and their impact during the medieval and modern 
>> periods.  (I have constantly experienced that myself during my five years 
>> stay in South Asia.) Indian history, spanning some 5000 years, is 
>> becoming ever more important even in the political arena, for example 
>> during the past elections of 2004, which had the effect that even 
>> classical philologists were drawn into the fray, whether they wanted or 
>> not.
>>
>> Consequently, both modern as well a classical Indology are essential.  We 
>> appeal to you to continue both branches of our discipline.
>>
>> Berlin Indology can look back, as mentioned, to a tradition spanning some 
>> 200 years. Many internationally famous scholars have emerged from Berlin. 
>> In the early 19th century, the study of India belonged to one of the 
>> major points of Humboldt?s reform of the German Universities. This should 
>> not be forgotten now that India receives great attention worldwide, as it 
>> grows economically and politically.
>>
>> Finally, it may be added that German Indology has a very good name in 
>> India, as Indologists have seriously endeavored to study Indian culture 
>> without prejudice. This long-standing and continuing attitude of German 
>> intellectuals towards Indian civilization has made Indology the best 
>> ambassador in India. It will be met with disbelief both in India  and 
>> worldwide if the German capital will have to do without an Indian 
>> Institute.
>>
>> The preservation of the internationally highly regarded Indology of 
>> Berlin therefore is important also for the reputation of Berlin as a 
>> place of research.  The demolition of Indology would also  be 
>> unreasonable in view of the large collections of manuscripts of the 
>> Prussian State Library and the Academy, as well as the rich holdings of 
>> the Museum of Indian Art. It would bring 200 years of a great tradition 
>> to an end.
>>
>> We therefore sincerely appeal to you to preserve the discipline and its 
>> BA., M.A., and PhD. courses. Anything but this would be a disaster, a 
>> waste of material and human capital.
