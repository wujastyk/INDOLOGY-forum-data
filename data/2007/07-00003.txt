Query
Diwakar Acharya's post has an interesting hint:
The Yak-cow hybrid, in Tibetan, is mdzo, and the
female mdzo-mo, pronounced dzo and dzomo respectively
in many current dialects. Tibetan dz- is often
equivalent to j- in Sanskritic languages, but c-
is also plausible. So it might not be out of
question to derive caama(ra) from dzomo. (The vowel
shift might be explained if, as is sometimes the
case, Tibetan o gets pronounced almost as shwa.)
In any case, I have also had the impression that the Skt word
is sometimes used to mean Yak rather than Yak-tail.
One further point -- the hybrid is not "stronger and
more enduring." The first generation hybrid does
somewhat better at lower altitudes, is more tame
(and so a good plough-animal), and the milch-cow
is an excellent dairy animal. However, after the first
generation the hybrid degenerates and is of no value
in any respect.
