Dear Indologists,

In the saura-pakSa, one of the classical Indian schools of astronomy, 
it is postulated that 47,400 divine years = 17,064,000 of our years 
elapsed between the beginning of the kalpa and the commencement of 
planetary motion.  This period of time is referred to as zRSTi-kAla.

Postulating this zRSTi-kAla is a mathematical trick, so to speak.  By 
delaying the commencement of planetary motion, a mean conjunction at 
the beginning of the current kali-yuga is achieved while working with a 
certain set of astronomical parameters.

As such, one would not necessarily expect to find this idea outside of 
the treatises of the saura-pakSa.  Indeed, I do not know of any 
references to this idea outside of said treatises.  However, I am 
curious as to whether any of you has come across anything like it in 
other types of Sanskrit texts, i.e., a mention of a period of 47,400 
divine years or 17,064,000 human years at the beginning of the kalpa, 
or something like that.

Any leads would be greatly appreciated.

Sincerely,
Toke
