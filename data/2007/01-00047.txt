Subject: South Asia Times Font ?
Message-ID: <161227079097.23782.15856666872254717173.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear List,

I am trying to update some old documents that I created using the
(non-unicode) font "South Asia Times". I didn't put the old font on
my new computer, and now I'm not finding a link online to download
it again.

Would anyone have a copy of this font they could mail to me off-list
-- or perhaps a better Internet sleuth than me could direct me to a
link to download it?

With many thanks,
Andrea
