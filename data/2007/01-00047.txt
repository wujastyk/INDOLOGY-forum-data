South Asia Times Font ?
Dear List,
I am trying to update some old documents that I created using the
(non-unicode) font "South Asia Times". I didn't put the old font on
my new computer, and now I'm not finding a link online to download
it again.
Would anyone have a copy of this font they could mail to me off-list
link to download it?
With many thanks,
Andrea
