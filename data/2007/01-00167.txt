own argument on Pollock's discourse.
THE ASYMMETRY OF THE DEBATE
The misunderstanding characterizing the debate between Jan Houben and me is 
indeed a fundamental one. I have addressed it in various contributions, but 
Houben's latest pronouncements (Fri, 12 Jan 2007 03:03:54) suggests to me that 
my point still hasn't come across, and therefore I'd like to repeat it briefly:
Our present debate was indirectly triggered by my contribution to the Festschrift
