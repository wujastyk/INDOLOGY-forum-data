Indology and "the disastrous  ideology of the 'pure Aryan              race'"
Dear Peter, and anyone interested,
There's a good description of the Ahnenerbe and the surrounding historical 
events and people in the book "The Occult Establishment" by James Webb 
(pp.321-4).  His companion book "The Occult Underground" is also excellent 
as a survey of various secret cults and individual "illuminati" mainly in 
the 19 and 20 centuries.  Webb writes well, and his research is thorough, 
including original use of archival sources, diaries and letters in several 
languages.  His work is refreshing in that it gives a good account not 
only of British and American movements and characters, but also of German, 
Polish and Russian participants.
Webb offers extracts from the diary of Wolfram Sievers as examples of the 
day-to-day events of the Ahnenerbe (p.323).  Interestingly, "...at 4:00 
[on 6 Jan 1944, Sievers] visited Professor Wuest at the university [of 
Munich] to talk about the Ahnenerbe publishing firm and their Sven Hedin 
Institute for Asian Exploration."
Later in "Establishment", Webb mentions Eliade, H. Zimmer, J. W. Hauer and 
others of the extended circle of Jung and the Eranos Conferences from 
about 1930.  Amongst them, Gustav Heyer and Baron Schrenk-Notzing were 
both active figures in Munich occult circles (p.395), though a link with 
the Ahnenerbe -- whose archives were destroyed -- is not established. 
There can be little doubt that Hauer, however, was convinced by NS 
anti-semitic, blood-and-soil, and other creeds, and considered Hitler "the 
genius of our people."
I mention Webb's books because it's my experience that they aren't as well 
known as they deserve to be.
Best,
Dominik
