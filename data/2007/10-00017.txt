Subject: avagraha in Malayalam Manuscript
Message-ID: <161227081317.23782.6669173021416018755.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I could also locate my ms and sent yesterday a scan to N. Ganesan with the 
following comment: 

"I think that the 
Malayalam script originally did not have an avagraha sign. Some Malayali 
scholars, however, have now and then, though very rarely, used an 
avagraha sign, which they knew from other scripts. In this case, the 
sign has apparently been taken over from the devanagari script. It has been 
made angular, though, to distinguish it from the Malayalam sign for the 
retroflex Ta, which is too close to the devanagari avagraha."

As Kengo Harimoto's scans have the same shape, this sign clearly was more 
widely known and seems to have become a regular (though not original) part 
of the Malayalam script.

Best regards, Asko Parpola
