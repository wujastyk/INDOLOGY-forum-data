Dear Mark,

I wholeheartedly concur with Lars Martin's sentiments. Whenever I have come 
across ranking lists for journals and publishers in our subject, those which 
produce materials in a form affordable to Indian students, scholars and 
universities tend to not to feature near the top of the list. The 
consequences of this for 'international scholarship' are not hard to imagine 
or discern.

Yours truly, Simon Brodbeck.
