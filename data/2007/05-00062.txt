It is actually listed on the website of the publisher 
Harrassowitz. Here's the shortened URL:

By the way, you have to go to the publishing division of 
Harrassowitz, that is: www.harrassowitz-verlag.de
You will *not* get the information from the bookselling 
division, that is: www.harrassowitz.de
For some reasons I don't know both parts of Harrassowitz 
have different web addresses (and pages) and do not mix 
well together in other respects. This can be very 
confusing.

All the best
