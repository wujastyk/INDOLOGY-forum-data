Making the Argument for Sanskrit
JN schrieb:
A similar observation holds good for the Institute for South Asian, 
Tibetan and Buddhist Studies in Vienna. The number of students who 
enrolled in beginner's Sanskrit increased to such an extent that this 
winter term, two parallel courses were needed and could fortunately also 
be offered. (The maximum number of students for a course was set at 30.)
As J?rgen Neuss rightly points out, it is of course another question how 
many students will successfully complete the course, but the large 
numbers of initial enrollment show that interest in Sanskrit is far from 
non-existent. One might actually be led to believe that classical 
Tibetan would draw more students, given the great popularity of all 
things Tibetan in society at large, but this is currently not the case, 
at least not in Vienna.
