Looking for Tamil works on 12th cent. A.D. cadjan leaves              (preserved in Tibet??)
Dear colleagues,
In a 1973 book (_The Smile of Murugan_, E.J. Brill, p.23),
Professor K.Zvelebil, referring to a 1965 book by prof. TPM, writes that:
"photostat copies of Tamil works on cadjan leaves of the 12th cent. 
A.D.  were made;
the manuscripts were preserved in the much more favorable climate of 
Tibet. But, so far,
they do not seem to be available for study."
And indeed, in his 1965 book (_A History of Tamil Literature_, Annamalai 
University),
professor TPM (= T.P. Meenakshisundaram [1901-1980]),
without mentioning any source of information, writes that:
"photostat copies of Tamil works in the cadjan leaves of the 12th cent. 
A.D.
preserved in the much more favorable climate of Tibet, have been made. 
Unfortunately
we cannot say whether they are at present available for study."
Does any one know whether such manuscripts
are indeed kept somewhere
and are available for consultation?
Yours with good wishes
