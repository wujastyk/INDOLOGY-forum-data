Dear Indology list members,

 

Australia is attempting to adopt a ranking system for journals so that
our publications and academic output can be "graded" (with consequences
for university funding). If any of you know of such rankings currently
in place for journals relevant to Indology, Buddhist Studies, and Asian
Studies, please let me know.

 

Regards

Mark
