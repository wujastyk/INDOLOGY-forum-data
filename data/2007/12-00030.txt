Dear Indologists,
 
Our recent discussion of the interaction between Sanskrit and Tamil  
traditions led me to a few questions. I would like to know the current  consensus 
opinion, if any, of the Sanskritists regarding the  following:
 
1. Were the Sanskrit and Prakrit short poem traditions influenced by a  
Deccani tradition (as suggested by G. L. Hart) or Tamil literary tradition  (as 
considered possible by S. Lienhard)? 
 
2. Was Bhagavatapurana written in Tamil Nadu and what is its relation to  
Alvar's bhakti poetry?
 
3. Was the motif of the hero encountering the heroine while hunting a  wild 
animal (as in the story of Dushyanta) present in the Sanskrit  tradition even 
earlier?
 
Thanks in advance.
 
Regards,
S. Palaniappan
