New discovery of "original" 10th Jaina Anga (Panhavagaranaim)?
Dear Antonio Ferreira-Jardim,
I intend to publish detail information about the text, but do not know yet 
when and where. I am going to send you off the list first three pages of a 
trial edition of the text I reported.
Yours sincerely,
Diwakar
