S.A. Srinivasan appears inclined to assume that Vaacaspatimi"sra, in  
his Saa"nkhyatattvakaumudii, may have used the negative "a" without  
intending to express reproach.
He begins his discussion of the privative with this observation  
(P1.4.5.16, p.40):

"Das a-privativum ist sandhigefaehrdet und geht manchmal verloren.  
Die Ueberlieferer tilgen es daher manchmal, oder sie aendern die  
Wortstellung, um es vor Verlust zu schuetzen."

The discussion of its use with finite verbs is on p.42.
