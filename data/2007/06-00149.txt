AW: bhAgavatapurANa - translation question - what does zUla mean?
Dear Colleague,
The stanza, of which Dr. McComas Taylor gives his transcription, is the 36th
of the first Adhyaaya, called Bhaktinaaradasamaagama, of the
Bhaagavatamaahaatmya, i.e. BhaaM I 36. The oldest variant of this floating
stanza (further parallels in EDS II/865a) seems to be Mahaabhaarata (MBh)
III 186,36:
		a.t.ta;suulaa janapadaa.h, ;siva;suulaa;s catu.spathaa.h /
		ke;sa;sulaa.h striyo raajan, bhavi.syanti yugak.saye //,
of which van Buitenen (p. 587) gives the following translation (being worth
its name): "At the end of the Eon the countryside will bristle with towers,
the crossroads with jackals, the women with hair, O king".
Best wishes
;Srutavega.
