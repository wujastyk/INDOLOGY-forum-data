Dear Prof. Joshi,
As I have retired from the University of British Columbia at the end of
2006 (I continue my association with the University as Professor
Emeritus), it is more convenient for me to receive mail at my home
address: 5346 Opal Place Richmond, B.C. Canada V7C 5B4
My preferred email address is <ashok.aklujkar at ubc.ca>. However
<aklujkar at interchange.ubc.ca> also works.
saadaram,
a.a.
