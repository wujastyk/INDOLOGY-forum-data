Mac-Devanagari
You can always change fonts and keyboard outlay (flag icon on upper  
right) as-you-write -- this is application-independent, and should  
work with both programs. If you do not have the Devanagari and  
Devanagari QWERTY flags, they need to be installed from your system  
disk or be implemented if already on your hard disk. Check in System  
Preferences --> International to see if you already have what you need  
there!
Cheers and Happy Boxing Day,
Alex

Many thanks to all who posted useful info about Mac Devanagari.   
Apologies for being so ignorant, but might someone send instructions  
on how to use both diacritics and devanagari in Nisus Writer Pro and  
NeoOffice?
