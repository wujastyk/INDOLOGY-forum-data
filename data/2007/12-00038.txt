Dear Dr. McComas,

thank you for posting this interesting document, which, regrettably,  
I am not able to decipher. I forwarded the file to other scholars and  
they too could not recognize the script.

Could you please send additional information, for instance about the  
context in which the specimen was found? Is it part of an inscription  
(as I suspect)?

Thank you, kind regards

Andrea Acri
