Indology and "the disastrous  ideology of the 'pure Aryan              race'"
Matthew Kapstein wrote:
And let us not forget the Leninists, Stalinists, Maoists, Italian and
East-European Fascists etc. etc. The role and behaviour of intellectuals in
dictatorial societies is a highly complex matter. It is interesting both
from a historiographical and biographical point of view. But it is not a
specifically Indological problem unless ideological views colour a scholar's
Indological production to the point where it becomes irrelevant. To claim
that X was a Nazi is less interesting than demonstrating that X's Nazi views
had a clear impact on his scholarship. 
We have to live with the fact that if a great mathematician becomes a
mass-murderer, he does not become a lesser mathematician, only a more
revolting human being. Moral or political deficiencies in a scholar or
artist are not necessarily relevant to the evaluation of their production.
