Bhattoji Diksita's Tattvakaustubha
It is amazing to see how the Digital Library of India is missing the one volume that I am looking for, but has several other ones.  Thanks, Dominik.

The Digital Library of India has digitized several issues of the journal, 
but not the one you mention, I think, Madhav.  The DLI is at
 	http://www.dli.ernet.in
and there's an increasing amount of indological material there.  Quite 
astounding, really.  The cataloguing is diabolical, so one needs to use 
a lot of imagination in searching.
The issues they have digitized are:
The_Journal_Of_The_Sri_Sankaragurukulam_Sri_Rangam_Volume_2.,
   2990100066301. Saveros Pau. 1940. multi. SOCIAL SCIENCES. 360 pgs.
The_Journal_Of_The_Sri_Sankaragurukulam_Sri_Rangam_Volume_4.,
   2990100066302. Saveros Pau. 1941. multi. SOCIAL SCIENCES. 686 pgs.
The_Journal_Of_The_Sri_Sankaragurukulam_Vol_1_1939., 2040130049044.
   Balasubrahmanyam. 1939. Multi. . 371 pgs.
The_Journal_Of_The_Sri_Sankaragurukulam_Vol_1_1939., 2040130066303.
   Balasubrahmanyam. 1939. Multi. . 371 pgs.
The_Journal_Of_The_Sri_Sankaragurukulam_Vol_2_1940-41., 2040130049045.
