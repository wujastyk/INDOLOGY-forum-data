Indus signs discussion
Dear Harry and All,
"High Noon" is not what we have proposed.
Instead, we have proposed a reasoned, point by point discussion of the 
main theories,  by preference involving the main contenders.          
(So far we have only got personalia. (*)  Enough of that!)
Now that Asko has refused to discuss things on our list (IER: 
<http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Indo-Eurasian_research/>), we will have 
to do it here
intend to withdraw from this discussion as an active participant and to 
remain an attentive listener"). 
But we can only do so if the proponents of our (Farmer-Sproat-Witzel) 
theory, too, are allowed to post here. This is not the case so far as 
far as S. Farmer and R. Sproat are concerned,  and I do not  want to 
"channel" them here all the time, a very tedious procedure.
Also, it would be advisable that Iravatham Mahadevan, whose recent  
Newspaper summary of his views (in the Hindu) has kicked off the 
current debate, would be present, but we do not know yet whether he 
wants to participate or not.
These technicalities apart, I do not think that we will have to wait 
for more years or decades to pass, or until we are all dead, and a new 
generation will pick up the pieces again. Our theory has been out for 
more than 2 years now, and people have had time for reflection -- and 
digestion.
So far we have only Asko's paper of June 2005, and a short newspaper 
article by I. Mahadevan of Jan. 2007,  both of which need discussion.  
(Plus, some rumors about oral discussions here or there).
In sum, why not take up the main points, pro and contra, in an orderly 
fashion (**), and discuss them  -- without the usual internet-style 
veering off at all tangents (as we have seen already in this thread).
Could one be clearer than this (my INDOLOGY post of February 13, 2007) :
"The idea was to discuss your paper, minus the personal remarks,
and the Farmer-Sproat-Witzel paper in the Current Anthropology format --
just focusing on the evidence.  ... ... We think this can be done in an 
orderly way online,
as we try to do on our list."  (**)
What is wrong, please, with this proposal?
Scholarship, including the humanities, progresses by critique and 
counter-critique, which allows bystanders (and proponents!) to see the 
strong and weak points of the proposed theories, --  not just by 
endless individual rumination.
In this sense, I hope we can make some progress here (once all involved 
can write on this list).
Michael
Notes:
(*) Personalia:
I do not wish to continue this item ad nauseam,  however,  reference 
has been made to A. Lawler's inappropriate characterizations of  (and 
clear inventions about)  Steve Farmer in his Science article of Dec. 
2004.  -- I too speak from experience: never trust any journalist! --
This is a matter of personal honor, but Steve cannot defend himself 
here. Therefore, I  must copy what he wrote about Lawler's "journalism" 
  in our list  
<http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Indo-Eurasian_research/message/6107> :
"....ad hominem remarks directed at me, drawn out of
context from a reporter's biographical fabrications about me, which
contained a number of flagrant misquotations. Parpola has since
circulated a paper on the Web that contains those same ad hominem
remarks and misquotations, which he has represented as fact -- despite
the fact that I told him forcefully in Kyoto [June 2005] that the 
remarks were not
mine."
(**) some IER rules:
Rule #4:
Rule #2:
Major topics of controversial nature. Topics of special importance
to the advance of premodern Eurasian studies may from time to time be
introduced to the List by core List members.  ...
The moderators will step in as needed to
ensure that these discussions keep on track and don't get diverted
(e.g., through gratuitous 'splitting' of threads) in tangental
directions. The idea is to bring these high-priority discussions to
resolution in an orderly way.
