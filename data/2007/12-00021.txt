I have a similar question as Prof. Dehejia for Mac.  With the help of  
Iyanaga Nobumi in Japan i've managed to get his Asian Extended Fonts  
input method working nicely for diacritics for MS-Word for Mac (OSX  
10.4), but cannot get decent Devanagari fonts to type with (those  
that come with Mac OSC Tiger don't really work, since one cannot type  
in combination characters), and i haven't found any others that work  
on Macs.  I'll have OSX Leopard working shortly and will report on  
whether that allows Devanagari input in Word.
