On the question of contradictions among the purANas more broadly, the 
creators of the ZivapurANa acknowledge disagreement among texts, but 
claim that the appearance of their purANa will lay all these 
disagreements to rest:
Before the ZP arises in the world:
?all the ??stras will contradict one another? (ZP 1.2.7)
'all [other] pur??as will clamour on the surface of the earth' (ZP 1.2.10)
there will be disputes among tIrthas, mantras, places of pilgrimage, 
pITha (seat, throne, sacred place), donations, devas and doctrines 
(siddhAntA) (ZP1.2.11-17)
Their idea is, 'Yes, there are contradictions among the purANas, but 
what the ZP says is correct!'
