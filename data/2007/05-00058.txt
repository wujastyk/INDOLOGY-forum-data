International Summer School on Jainism
[...]
Distinguished Prof Cromwell Crawford at University of Hawaii has started
a wonderful initiative - an international Jain Summer School which is
growing from strength to strength and is fully funded. This year 35
scholars from North America are heading for India shortly - it is
accredited and very well coordinated. There is a special website
www.jainstudies.org <http://www.jainstudies.org/>   We would request you
to promote it to your colleagues and postgraduate students.

I am writing to request your cooperation to promote this for 2008 and
future using <the> Indology list ...
Best wishes,
