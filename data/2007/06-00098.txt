Indological full-book PDFs : Sylvain Levi
As long as we're on the subject, are any of you
aware of an available, useable scan of Levi's
Mahaayaanasuutraala.mkaara, including both
text and translation volumes (together or
separately)? I haven't found it in Google or DLI.
In the absence of such, I would be grateful for
suggestions about how a copy in any format might
be obtained.
