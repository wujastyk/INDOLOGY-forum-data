As long as we're on the subject, are any of you
aware of an available, useable scan of Levi's
Mahaayaanasuutraala.mkaara, including both
text and translation volumes (together or
separately)? I haven't found it in Google or DLI.

In the absence of such, I would be grateful for
suggestions about how a copy in any format might
be obtained.
