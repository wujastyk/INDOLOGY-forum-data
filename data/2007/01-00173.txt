European studies on South Asian Languages
Dear colleague,
I am by profession a computer scientist and logician. For the last 5  
years, I have been working
in computational linguistics for the Sanskrit language. This has  
resulted in a Web site with various
Web services for Sanskrit linguistics, at http://sanskrit.inria.fr/
This effort is still going on.
Various publications pertaining to this research have been published,  
please refer to my publications
page http://pauillac.inria.fr/~huet/bib.html at items [78], [84] to  
[89] and [92].
I hope these informations are of help to your survey
Best regards
G. Huet
