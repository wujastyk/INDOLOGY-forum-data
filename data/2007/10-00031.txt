Asoka's "nimsi[dhi]ya
Thank you, Lance.  I'd forgotten about Janert's studies, and I'll look at 
them.
Bloch appears to be repeating some of Hultzsch's footnote, and these refs. 
to Nagarjuni and Kharavela usage go back to B?hler.  It all sound pretty 
plausible to me.  Hultzsch knew about this line of interpretation, but 
preferred his staircase.
Many thanks again,
Dominik
