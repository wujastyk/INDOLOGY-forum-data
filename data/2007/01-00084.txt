Indology and "the disastrous  ideology of the 'pure Aryan              race'"
Bravo, Prof. Hart! 
Nonetheless, the discussion has been instructive.  It reminds us all of the importance of looking at scholars' moods and motivations in understanding any derived body of knowledge.

  Re: Indology and "the disastrous ideology of the 'pure Aryan race'"
  I would like to suggest humbly that this subject has been  
  sufficiently explored in this list.  In any event, I thought the  
  Indology list is concerns issues and ideas pertaining to classical  
  Indian studies, whether in Sanskrit or, occasionally, in the other  
  classical language of India, Tamil (which is non-Indo-European and  
  certainly does not represent the "pure Aryan race," whatever that  
  is).  If some members wish to pursue aspects of the history of the  
  Third Reich, perhaps they could start another list.  George Hart
