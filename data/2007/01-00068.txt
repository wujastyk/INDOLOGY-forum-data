Dear Jan,
You are probably refering to me, "Roland", to suggest a contextually  
philological conjecture. In that case, I missed the argument involved  
here when you say "no one less than", I'm afraid. Is indeed another  
more estimated person than myself intended?

If you don't mind, I would like to encourage you to do as philologists do:

First, re-read and try to understand Reinhold Gr?nendahls first  
question exactly (esp. his last sentence: "where do these relations  
surface in indological writings of that period?"). For a better  
understanding, it could be helpful to re-read questions nos. 2 and 3,  
too.
Second, read your insinuation with regard to Gr?nendahl's article  
exactly ("your well-documented and cleverly argued article liberating  
each and every German indologist of the 1900-1945 period from any  
possible association with the German government and its disastrous  
ideology of the pure Aryan race") in order to understand my response  
properly. It could also be advisable to re-read Gr?nendahl's article.  
Finally, you should say that your insinuation has been against the  
written facts.
Third, read and try to understand my "step forward", as you say, in  
the light of your new understanding once again. To give you an  
interpretatory hint: I showed that your characterisation of  
Gr?nendahl's article ("liberating each and every German indologist  
...") goes against the written facts. Further, in that email, I said  
nothing about where relations between Indologists and the German  
government surfaced in indological (!) writings of the Nazi period.

With kind regards,
Roland Steiner
