Emne: Patanjali quote
I am looking for the origin of the following quotation:
"When you are inspired by some great purpose, some extraordinary project, all your thoughts break their bounds. Your mind transcends limitations, your consciousness expands in every direction, and you find yourself in a new, great, and wonderful world. Dormant forces, faculties, and talents come alive, and you discover yourself to be a greater person by far than you ever dreamt to be."
In books and at websites this quotation is ascribed to Patanjali and his Yogasutras. To me it sounds decidedly modern. I wonder who authored it and how it has reached the internet.
I was suggested by a colleague to ask you all for help and assistance (at email-address: Stig.Toft.Madsen at nias.ku.dk). Can anyone recognize this quote?
