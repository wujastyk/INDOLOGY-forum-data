Making the Argument for Sanskrit
I hope this does not go out of hand, but...

Is this entirely accurate?  According to the more widely accepted  
version of the occasion, Oppenheimer _thought of_ the verse in the  
form of "I am become death, the destroyer of worlds," at the Trinity  
test.  See for example:
http://www.aps-pub.com/proceedings/1442/Hijiya.pdf
This article, published in the Proceedings of the American  
Philosophical Society, deals exactly with the effect of the  
Bhagavadg?t? on Oppenheimer.
We can watch Oppenheimer himself recalling the occasion at:

This was shot in 1965, twenty years after the test.
The tone of the above mentioned article in fact is to blame the G?t?  
for the invention of the atomic bomb (which I myself find is  
completely absurd).  On the other hand, the G?t? is (in a way)  
blamed for Holocaust as well. This, at least, is a sad and ironic  
coincidence.
In the context of current discussion, I wonder if listing famous  
people (such as above) who had some Sanskrit background is helpful  
for furthering the cause to maintain indological studies.  Perhaps it  
depends on how we spin it ;)
Wikipedia has an entry "Sanskrit in the West":

As a little lighter note, in the domain of popular culture, Madonna  
had a song in Sanskrit.  And as a little geeky note, the theme of the  
TV show Battlestar Galactica is allegedly the Gayatri Mantra.  But,  
however I try, I cannot hear it as Sanskrit.
All the best,
