request for an email address
Dear List,
If any list member knows of the email address of the art historian Prof. 
Anna Dallapiccola [presently at Edinburgh, as I am told], I would be 
grateful if this could be sent to me offlist, so as to protect her privacy.
Thank you for any help in this matter.
George Thompson
