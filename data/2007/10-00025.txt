Dinesh Chandra Bhattacharya/Bhattacharyya
The author Dinesh Chandra Bhattacharyya wrote a number of articles on the 
cultural history of Bengal in the IHQ and similar journals in the 1940s, 
including "New Light on Vaidyaka Literature", "Dates of early historical 
records of Bengal," "Newly discovered copper-plate from Tipperah," "Pala 
chronology?a reply to Prof. Banerjee," "Mandana, Suresvara and Bhavabhuti 
: the problem of their identity," "Sanskrit scholars of Akbar?s time," 
"Vasudeva Sarvabhauma," etc.
The author Dinesh Chandra Bhattacharya  wrote the book "History of Navya 
Nyaya in Mithila" and journal articles on nyaya, Bengal, etc., at the same 
period.
Can anyone confirm or refute whether these are two spellings of the name 
of one person?
I've checked the LC name authority list, and it doesn't deal with the -yy- 
name. SARDS and other sources don't seem to engage with the issue.
Best, and thanks,
