But, still, you!! an appreciation
Dominick,
Well, yes, I think I knew you were no longer trying to handle the whole 
enterprise, but let me take this moment to thank you personally for the 
enormous amounts of energy, good will, humor and (definitely) patience, 
that you invested in the success of Indology.  It represents a wonderful 
resource and a model scholarly online community.
best wishes,
Frank
