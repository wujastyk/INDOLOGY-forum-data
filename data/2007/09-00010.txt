Dear Madhav,

For what it's worth, Apte couldn't recall the
source either. He cites it without reference
in the dictionary, though. The chapter on
the imperative in his Guide to Skt Composition
gives a couple of similar verses from the
kaavya lit., which look
as though they were inspired by this one. 
It recalls to me also a benediction that
is recited (in Tibetan!) at the close of
Tibetan Buddhist prayer services.
