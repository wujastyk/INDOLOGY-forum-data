Indus signs discussion
Dear all,
I have the feeling that discussing this topic is again getting very 
personal and will us lead nowhere. Time will tell if the 
no-script-theory holds good or if there is anything of value in Asko's 
work. I for one think that his book "Deciphering the Indus Script" from 
1994 provides the best reading on how to look at these signs, 
irrespective of the Dravidian model he advocates personally.
Academic results don't arise from instant judgements; we have to keep 
all arguments in mind, pro and contra, for years, or decades, who knows. 
  One day there will be a result, or not.
High-noon on Harrapa lane is not what most of us readers look for on 
this page.
