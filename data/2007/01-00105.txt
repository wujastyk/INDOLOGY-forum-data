Making the Argument for Sanskrit (was: Re: How to salvage              Sanskrit in Berlin)
Further to David's point below, it could be useful to compile a list of 
particularly famous people who had Sanskri, sometimes unexpectedly, in 
their backgrounds.  Using such a list would be purely a rhetorical device, 
but could still be effective in winning some hearts and minds.
examples off the top of my head:
Hermann Grassmann (1809-1877), famous mathematician.
Leonard Bloomfield (1887--1949), structural linguist, behaviourist,
   scholar of American Indian languages, and founder of the Linguistic
   Society of America.
Ferdinand de Saussure (1857--1913), linguist, founder of structuralism.
