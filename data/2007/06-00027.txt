Sanskrit Universities List Updated and more...
Dear colleague,
Thank you for your useful information.
One of the common classical languages in Japan, Sanskrit is taught in
many national and private institutions over the country (at least more
than 40). So it is not easy to make an exhaustive list right away.
Best,
