not me!
Dear friends and colleagues,
I started up this discussion forum, on Friday 23rd November, 1990, and I 
administered it single-handed for many years, until it was closed on 
Wednesday 18 April, 2001.
When the new INDOLOGY forum opened on Thursday 12 July, 2001, it was
no longer managed by me, and it was run on different, more formal lines. 
There is a committee that is in charge of the INDOLOGY forum, and although 
I am currently a member of the committee, I am by no means in charge, and 
I just take turns to be on duty, along with every one else.
If you need to change or update your mailing-list settings, update your 
email address, etc., please don't write to me personally about it.  The 
place to write is the committee, at
   indologycomittee at liverpool.ac.uk
I do feel quite touched when I receive personal requests for your account 
settings to be changed, since it's a reminder of the old days when 
INDOLOGY was my sole charge.  But I just can't keep up, and it isn't my 
business anyhow, except in my periodic duty days.  So I would be grateful 
if you would use the email address above for all admin matters.
"Indologists are Doin' it For Themselves."
