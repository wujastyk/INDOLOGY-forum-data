Query: New Catalogus Catalogorum Access
Dear Friends,
Does any one have a lead on how to access (on a single entry basis)  
the yet unpublished portion of the New Catalogus Catalogorum? A  
student of mine is trying to obtain the complete textual sources of  
the Vakroktipancasika, for which the only reference I have is the old  
Kavyamala edition.
best,
