Dear colleagues: 
I am looking for for you help. Since in the hagiographical texts of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, it is said that he had encounters with scholars from all sects in his trips for the south and north India, where are register of Muslims, Buddhists, Jains, Sankarites, Sikhs, etc. My search is, if are there some registration about possible contacts of Chaitanya with Christian? Because it is supposed that these were present in Madras and in the capital of the Akbar in India in those days. Thank you.
