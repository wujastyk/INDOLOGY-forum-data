Finding Indological full-book PDFs on Google Books
In re:
Leaving aside the question of the utility of time spent replacing pdf 
pages, one does not need the full Acrobat to do this. There is a 
nifty little program (sorry this time! Mac only :-) ) called "Combine 
PDFs" which allows one to, as the web site says, "Drop some PDF or 
picture files on the application or the main window. Reorder or 
remove pages as you want. Enter some meta information like the Title 
and save the new PDF."

It's nice and easy to use!  JAS
