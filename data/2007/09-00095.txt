privative a with finite verb
Hello George,
The un- in 'undo' is not a reflex of alpha privative, although maybe 
there is some influence of the latter on it.  It is a weak form of the 
Old English prefix on-, ond-, and-, meaning 'against'.  See anti-. 
See for example the American Heritage Dictionary under un- (2), and in 
the Indo-European Roots section, see *ant-. 
Best wishes,
George Thompson
