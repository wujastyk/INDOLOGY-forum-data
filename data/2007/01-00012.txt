Making the Argument for Sanskrit
I would like to second what Patrick says.  In my experience at  
Berkeley, Sanskrit is an integral and essential part of our South  
Asia program -- but it is only one of many South Asian languages we  
teach (including Hindi, Urdu, Punjabi, Tamil, Bengali, and soon, I  
hope, Telugu).  If we argued for a department of Sanskrit and Indian  
Studies or something of the sort, the administration would not pay us  
any heed at all.  After all, while the importance of Latin for the  
study of the West is indisputable, we do not find departments of  
Latin and European Studies anywhere.  I would add to Patrick's  
observation that it is important to involve local South Asian  
communities in our programs.  At Berkeley, we have raised money from  
the Tamil, Telugu, Bengali, and Punjabi communities for our  
programs.  I did approach some members of the community with the hope  
that they would raise money for Sanskrit, but they demurred because  
we do not adhere to their Hindu(tva) tenets.  In reading over the  
suggestions on this list, I find a sort of nostalgia -- for the time  
when Sanskrit and South Asian Studies were synonymous.  Much fine  
work was done then, but times have changed, and at most institutions  
Sanskrit will only be supported as part of a broader South Asian  
Program, including modern South Asia and modern languages.  It's  
worth remarking that about 1.5 billion people live in South Asia --  
more than Europe, North and South America combined.  It is easier to  
argue with deans for Hindi/Urdu, the third most widely spoken  
language in the world, than it is for Sanskrit, whom 500 people  
claimed to speak in the last census.  But it is possible (and  
necessary) to make a compelling case for Sanskrit as part of a  
broader program.  George Hart
