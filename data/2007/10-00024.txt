P.L. Vaidya mentions in the preface to the "History of Navya-Nyaaya  
in Mithilaa" by Dineshchandra [sic] Bhattacharya says: "His  
contributions on the History of Vaidyaka, Dharma"saastra, Navya- 
Nyaaya and Sanskrit Grammar scattered in the pages of different  
scholarly journals will immortalise him". I think you will find that  
this is one person.
