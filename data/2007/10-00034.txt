Taaraa's curse
In the Northern recension of the Raamaaya.na Taaraa, Vaalin's wife,  
curses Raama to lose Siitaa after he recovers her. This curse seems  
to be missing from the Southern rec. Does the curse re-appear in  
later literature based on the Raamaaya.na? Has anyone done research  
on this motif?
Thanks for your kind help,
