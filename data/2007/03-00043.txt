river mahatmyas
I suggest to look at the catalogues of mss. which 
are full of such (mostly unpublished) texts:
for example, in Eggeling's IO Catalogue:
n? 3434-36 Pinaakinii-maahaatmya (river Pennar) asigned to the Brahmaa.n.daP;
n? 3601: ms. (Telugu script) of the 
Paapaghni-maahaatmya, professing to form part of 
the VaayuP
I remember also having seen somewhere (Descr. 
cat. Palace library or C.O.L. Trivandrum, I 
think) mss. of Taamrapar.nii- and 
Kaaverii-maahaatmyas
(About the Revaa- or Narmadaa-maahaatmya, it 
should be noted that the mss. of it claim to be 
part of the VaayuP, cf. IO Catalogue n? 3595, ms. 
dated 1610 AD,  despite the fact that when it was 
published at the Venkateshvara Press it was 
ascribed to the SkandaP, forming its 
Revaa-kha.n.da; as well noted by Hazra 1940: 158 
fn., the original ascription of this maahaatmya 
to the Vaayu is supported by the printed text 
itself, 5.16 and 229.1; samely, it is not 
described in NaaP 1,104 on the Skanda but well in 
NaaP 1,95 as the uttarabhaaga of the VaaP).
Hope this may help,
