Message-ID: <161227079422.23782.6926549159814924216.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

If there are any New Zealanders or scholars living in New Zealand on this list, or anyone knowing of any South Asian programs there with some classical component, would they please contact me off the list?  I have reasons I can't publish yet.

Thanks,

Allen
