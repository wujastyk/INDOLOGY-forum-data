Over the coming weeks Repositorium is being migrated from local
hardware to a bureau. When the system is ready, an announcement will be
made soliciting interest. Initially users will be given the opportunity
jointly to establish an Indological and Buddhological bibliographical
database. In the meantime, please direct all queries to:
