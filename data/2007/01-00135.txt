Making the Argument for Sanskrit
In addition to the remarks I made below in support of George Hart's
argument, I would like to add another argument which I believe is relevant
to the scaling of Indological and South Asian studies at Western
universities: the enormous dimensions of the subject! As a cultural and
linguistic region, India is VAST. Sanskrit literature and culture is equally
vast, and complex. This means that a proper understanding of India, its
languages, society and culture requires a rich flora of academic positions
and good number of Indological / South Asian institutes. The down-scaling we
are now seeing will a few years from now probably be seen as a serious
mistake. The problem is that so much modern university politics are driven
by student number considerations, not the need for knowledge and competence
in the absolute sense of the word. This means that we must also address the
politicians, not simply the university deans who often have to act with both
hands tied behind their backs.
