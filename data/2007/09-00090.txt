Subject: privative a with finite verb

Speijer's Syntax sect. 404, cites a vaart. On P. 6, 3, 73 that allows "a" on
the finite verb, if it expresses blame, as apacasi tvam jaalma "you
miscook"; Vasu's translation of this is "The na of nan is elided before a
verb also when reproach is meant" (and cites the example already quoted in
Speijer).

Jonathan,

In fact, Whitney ?1121b gives two examples:
asp.rhayanti (BhP. & "Si"s) and alokayati (SD).
But I cannot check them immediately.
