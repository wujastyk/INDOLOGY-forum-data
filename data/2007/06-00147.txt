bhAgavatapurANa - translation question - what does zUla mean?
Dear colleagues
The description of the Kali yuga in BhP (0.1.36, paNDita-pustakAlaya 
ed.) states that:
aTTazUlA janapadAH zivazUlA dvijAtayaH . kAminyaH kezazUlinyaH 
sambhavanti kalAviha
Tagare's translation says 'In this Kali age, the country will be full of 
people who sell food, BrAhmaNas, selling the Vedas and women living by 
prostitution' (lxxv).
Can anyone help me get 'selling food' out of aTTazUla, 'selling Vedas' 
out of zivazUla and 'prostitution/selling hair' out of kezazUla?
thanks in advance
