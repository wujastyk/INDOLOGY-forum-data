Dear Colleagues,

Some of you may find Scholia useful.

Scholia is a collaborative bibliographical archive for Indologists and
Buddhologists. It enables researchers to freely publish data on their
own articles, books, theses, software, working papers, interests &c..

The foundation has already been established. Over 30,000 Indological
and Buddhological records spanning 1970 to the present are currently
available. All users can search the archive with its public content.

The main aim at the moment is to broaden and deepen the coverage.
Registered users are encouraged to submit material on their own work
and publications. The archival platform is known to scale gracefully to
several tens of millions of records so feel free to submit as much as
you wish.


For further details please follow this link:

The archive can be searched from here:

About Scholia

Scholia is a collaborative archive enabling Indologists and

been instrumental in `seeding' this project.



Best regards,
