one of the addresses you requested
Dear Prof. Joshi,
As I have retired from the University of British Columbia at the end of 2006
(I continue my association with the University as Professor Emeritus), it is
more convenient for me to receive mail at my home address:
5346 Opal Place
Richmond, B.C.
Canada V7C 5B4
My preferred email address is <ashok.aklujkar at ubc.ca>. However
<aklujkar at interchange.ubc.ca> also works.
saadaram,
a.a.
