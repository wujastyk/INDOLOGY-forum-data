Walter Wuest
I just got this message from Stefan Rebenich, Professor of Ancient  
History at Universit?t Bern which could have some interest for  
Indologists too:
"I co-supervised a Munich thesis on Walther
Wuest and his institutional standing as Dean and Rector magnificus  
which will
be published in due course. It is an exemplary study on university  
politics in
Nazi Germany, less concerned with indology."
