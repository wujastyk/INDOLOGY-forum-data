Halle Mission: really major publication
Of course,for edited volumes and collected works on Asian studies
(esp. South Asia), full article citations with page numbers, for
each item in each table of contents, can be found in the online
Bibliography of Asian Studies, which most research libraries
subscribe to...  Many libraries also purchase toc data (with page
numbers) from commercial firms and load them into their individual
online catalogs, though not necessarily uploaded to national
utilities like OCLC WorldCat.
