Hello Ferenc,
Since it is a f?iskola and not an egyetem, you might want to try something
like
Dharma Gate Buddhist Highschool or
Dharma Gate Buddhist College
You could add Budapest as well:
(The) Budapest Dharma Gate Buddhist Highschool or
(The) Budapest Dharma Gate Buddhist College
Best regards,
Lars Martin
