Comparisons of Ramayana versions?
I have a small bibliography on different Ramayanas that is a work in 
progress. It is a 8/9 page word document. Towards the end of the list are 
resources of comparative studies. If you want, I can email it to you 
separately and won't burden the listserve.
Thanks,
Bindu
