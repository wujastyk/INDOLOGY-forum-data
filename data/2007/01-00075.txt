I'm glad to hear it, Jan. So allow me to suggest the following terms of trade (pardon 
my "business English", unfamaliar territory!):
1) You or other members of the list tender items of what they consider evidence in 
support of a connection between indology and "the disastrous ideology of the 'pure 
Aryan race'". Tenders have to comply with the following criteria:
1a) The tendered items must relate to both aspects of the issue, viz., (i.) indology, 
AND (ii.) "the disastrous ideology of the 'pure Aryan race'", in order to establish a 
relation between them.
1b) The tendered items must be verifiable.
1c) For the purpose of verification they must be specified as precisely as possible.
1d) They must be tendered in a way that allows other members of the list to follow 
the line of argument.
1e) Preference is given to primary evidence, i.e., writings of a predominantly 
indological nature that may contribute in any way to "the disastrous ideology of the 
'pure Aryan race'".
2) I have the right to examine each item tendered individually before I accept the 
tender.
3) Should I find the item suitable for the said purpose, I shall make a clear and 
unambiguous statement to the following effect:
"I accept this as a valid argument in support of a connection between indology and 
the disastrous ideology of the 'pure Aryan race'".
4) Should I find the item unsuitable for the said purpose, I have the right to reject 
the tender, and the tenderer is obliged to declare himself clearly and unambiguously 
in either of these two ways:
4a) "I hold firm because the examination of the tendered item (under #2) is flawed 
for the following reason(s): ..." (to be specified and then submitted to the same 
procedure).
4b) "I withdraw this item and all claims to the effect that it can serve as evidence of 
a connection between indology and the disastrous ideology of the 'pure Aryan race'".
5) After every item tendered has been examined, the trade is closed and either you 
or I will "yield to the voice of truth", as M?ller put it, and admit: "I was wrong".
Do you accept these terms?
Greetings
Reinhold
