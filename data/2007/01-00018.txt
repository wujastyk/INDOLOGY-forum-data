Making the Argument for Sanskrit
Herman Tull wrote:
I have heard a similar argument made in favour of Latin. In fact, the same
argument can be made for such languages as Finnish, Hungarian and Turkish,
just to mention a few. All these languages enforce a rigorous way of
thinking, indeed both Finnish and Hungarian do so better than Sanskrit,
which both Finnish and Hungarian outshine in terms of "perfection". If you
are thinking of cultural content associated with Sanskrit, its main
attraction is its profound "otherness", not its logical structure. Seen from
a Western point of view, Sanskritic culture is the greatest and most
fascinating "alternative" intellectual laboratory we can imagine. Thus, the
study of Sanskrit contributes to our own self-understanding just as well as
to our understanding of India, and indeed to the understanding of mankind.
However, such philosophical values are of little consequence to the
hard-nosed people who run our universities these days. They are out there
like hungry dogs threatening to kill us, and we have to throw them a bone or
two, otherwise we will not be able to pursue the really interesting
questions we love so much.
