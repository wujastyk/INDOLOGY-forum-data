Si.mharaaja's Praak.rtaruupaavataara ?
Dear colleagues,
I read in Ulloor S. Parameswara Aiyer's Kerala 
Sahityacaritram (History of Kerala Literature), 
vol. 1, p. 349, that Samudrabandha (who lived at 
the Court of Ravivarman Kula/sekhara around 1300 
AD, being the author of a commentary on the 
ala.mkaarasarvasva with examples in praise of the 
king) had a son, Si.mharaaja by name, who 
composed a work bearing the title 
Praak.rtaruupaavataara (beside a commentary on 
the Karpuurama?jariisa.t.taka).
Has anybody an idea of the nature of this 
Praak.rtaruupaavataara (which "clarifies the 
scholarship in Praakrit language" - 
praak.rtabhaa.sayil ulla paa.n.dityatte 
spa.s.tiikarikkunnu) and if it has been published?
Thank you very much,
Christophe Vielle
