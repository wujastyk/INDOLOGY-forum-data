temple, but wrongly so... or something like that. From 25 year old 
memory.)

What struck me in the Vastu* Up. was that the comm. (worked on by D. 
Bhattacharya) was all about Saunaka mantras, not as expected in Orissa 
about Paippalada ones, and that the MS shown in photo was a palm leaf 
with ... Devanagari script.

You draw your own conclusions....

I have some old notes on this case (on paper) but would have to locate 
them...

Best,
Michael
