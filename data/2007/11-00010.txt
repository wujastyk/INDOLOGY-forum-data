Nira-Narsingpur Narasimha
I find the possibilities mentioned by both Prof. Deshpande and Prof. Salomon
quite plausible. 
Prof. Joshi, Will you please e-mail a copy of the text or text section which
gives rise to your query? Having the context in front is important in such
matters. At least, please mention the book/edition in which the
Lakmii-n.rsi.mha-sahasra-naaman is printed. Then I can see if it is locally
accessible. 
Against, Prof. Deshpande's expectation, I know practically nothing about the
local traditions of Nira-Narsingpur -- an unfortunate consequence of being
more interested in cricket and the writings of Maharashtrian social
reformers when the family elders were discussing Sanskrit stotras or places
of pilgrimage!

Sadaaniiraa. Could, for exampe, Niiraa be a shortening of some such original
name? Or, perhaps more likely, is the explanation to be sought in Dravidian
rather than IA?<
