Making the Argument for Sanskrit : a Real Problem and              Directions for a Solution
So now it's Professor Houben's 
However, this says nothing about his current position on the claims cited in my 
earlier message. Are they unceremoniously dropped, or does he stick to them 
courageously (I think that was the word), in spite of the objections I raised? Has he 
taken notice of my point, and - are these claims open for debate?
"Making the argument for Sanskrit" is not entirely unrelated to the style of 
discussion on this list, I think.
