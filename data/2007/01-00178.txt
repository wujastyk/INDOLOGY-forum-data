Archiving the old INDOLOGY website
In a message to this list on 2 Dec 2005 (http://tinyurl.com/2ll5q5), I 
announced that the INDOLOGY website would be moving away from the old UCL 
address (my own personal, college-provided web directory), to the 
new address
   http://indology.info
I put a redirecting page at the old address.  The old site at UCL hasn't 
been updated for a year, and the new site is a live concern, thanks to the 
excellent work of Richard Mahoney, and the ongoing financial support of 
the UK's Society for South Asian Studies (click logo on the website, 
bottom right).
Today, I am taking the next logical step, which is to take the old website 
offline.
I'll leave the forwarding page there, but it will only work for links to 
the main "front" page of the old website, not for any direct links to 
subsidiary pages "inside" the website.
If you want to have a nice moment of nostalgia, you can always look at the 
old website in the WayBack Machine, where the whole web is archived: put 
the old URL "http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgadkw/indology.html" into the WayBack 
Machine at "http://www.archive.org".
