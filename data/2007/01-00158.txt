Forwarded to the list:
  Mrs Colette Caillat, member of the Institute, died on January 15, 2007, the day of her eighty-sixth birthday. We will remember her as a demanding and precise scholar; as an excellent Professor; as an efficient and critical dissertation guide, entirely devoted to her students; as founder and director of a research team associated with the CNRS with remarkable results; and as the Director of the Institute of Indian Civilization who, during a very difficult time, succeeded in maintaining and developing the institution.
