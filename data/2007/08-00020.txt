South Asian attitudes towards furniture
In Kerala there is a craze for everything foreign and so smuggled  
goods are sold out like anything. Here in Trivandrum, there is a  
place-Bimappally which is known for shops selling foreign items.When  
one returns after visit abroad  friends and relatives ask for  
something foreign one has brought for them- it can be anything. To own  
anything foreign is considred by many to be a matter of prestige,  
there is also a negligence for indigineous and veneration for foreign.  
A Malayalam poet has written lines sarcastic on this fascination for  
foreign.
