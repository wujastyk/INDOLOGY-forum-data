Dear Madhav et al.,

It seems odd to have a river whose name seems to mean just "water." I 
suspect there is something more going on here, though I couldn't say exactly 
what. But there may be some clues in the information provided by Mayrhofer 
in KEWA s.v. niiram, where he refers to other (early) river names such as 
Sadaaniiraa. Could, for exampe, Niiraa be a shortening of some such original 
name? Or, perhaps more likely, is the explanation to be sought in Dravidian 
rather than IA?

Dear Dr. Joshi,

We know that Niiraa is the name of the river that joins the river Bhiimaa at 
the town of Narsingpur (near Solapur), and that the town of Narsingpur is 
known for its temple of Narasimha.  The river name seems to be a feminine 
form of the Sanskrit word niira- "water".  As the rivers are commonly 
treated as goddesses (cf. Anne Feldhaus's work on river-goddesses in 
Maharashtra), one can assume that niiraa the river name also becomes the 
name of the river goddess that may be locally identified with Lakshmi. 
Perhaps Ashok Aklujkar may know something more of the local traditions of 
Nira-Narsingpur, as he grew up in the town of Akluj which is nearby.

I am thankful to Dr. Madhav Deshpande for the information about Neera
interpretation for Laksmi-Nrsimha.I would ask him again the meaning of
Nira in the same context.

There is a famous Nrsimha temple in Maharashtra in a town called Nira -
Narsingapur.  I don't have a map in front of me, but this town is
probably on the bank of the river Neeraa/Niraa (?).  There is indeed a
river in the region by that name.  This town is close to my family's
original home town, Tembhurni, near Solapur, and Nrsimha has been the
family deity of the Deshpande family.
