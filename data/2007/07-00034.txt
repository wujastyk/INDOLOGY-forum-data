[Histmed] Jewish medical refugees in India
Dear Colleagues,
I am looking for historical material / scholars who have information about
Jewish medics who took refuge in Rajasthan under the protection of the
Maharaja of Bikaner pre and during World War II. They include: Richard James
Weingarten, Chief MO of Bikaner; Fritz Donath (radiologist); Josef Tauber;
Alfred Hollositz (dental surgeon); Max Scheck; Max Henn (chemist); Emma Henn
(nurse); Robert Heilig who was in Mysore and had a distinguished career in
Jaipur; also Dr (?Joseph) Wolfe.
Any information would be most gratefully received.
