<http://www.claysanskritlibrary.org/volumes6.php>

These four volumes are scheduled for August 2007. You can also read
some of the translators? Insights
<http://www.claysanskritlibrary.org/insights.php>
on these volumes.

?Friendly Advice? by N?r?ya?a & ?King V?krama?s
Adventures?
<http://www.claysanskritlibrary.org/volumes_detail.php?id=40>
Judit T?rzs?k

?Friendly Advice? combines numerous animal fables with human
stories. In one tale an intrusive ass is simply thrashed by his
master, but the meddlesome monkey ends up with his testicles crushed.
This volume also contains the compact version of ?King V?krama?s
Adventures,? thirty-two popular tales about a generous emperor, told
by thirty-two statuettes adorning his lion-throne.

Handsome Nanda
<http://www.claysanskritlibrary.org/volumes_detail.php?id=43>
by A?vagho?a
Linda Covill

Nanda has it all?youth, money, good looks and a kittenish wife who
fulfils his sexual and emotional needs. He also has the Buddha, a
dispassionate man of immense insight and self-containment, for an
older brother. When Nanda is made a reluctant recruit to the
Buddha?s order of monks, he is forced to confront his all-too-human
enslavement to his erotic and romantic desires.

Maha?bh?rata Book Nine: Shalya (volume two of two)
<http://www.claysanskritlibrary.org/volumes_detail.php?id=75>
	Justin Meiland

In one of the most famous passages in the ?Maha?bh?rata,?
Dur?y?dhana, the heroic but flawed king of the K?uravas, meets his
end when he is dishonorably defeated in battle by his arch enemy,
Bhima. Framing a fascinating account of the sacred sites along the
river Sar?svati, the duel poignantly portrays the downfall of a once
great hero in the face of a new order governed by Krishna, in which
the warrior code is brushed aside in order to ensure the predestined
triumph of the P?ndavas.

Rama?s Last Act
<http://www.claysanskritlibrary.org/volumes_detail.php?id=66>
by Bhavabh?ti
	Sheldon I. Pollock

?Rama?s Last Act? by Bhava?bhuti is counted among the
greatest Sanskrit dramas. The work at once dramatizes the
?Ram?yana??it is one of the earliest theatrical adaptations of
Valm?ki?s epic masterpiece?and revises its most intractable
episode, the hero?s rejection of his beloved wife. Human agency in
the face of destiny, the power of love, and the capacity of art to
make sense of such mysteries are the themes explored in this singular
literary achievement of the Indian stage.
