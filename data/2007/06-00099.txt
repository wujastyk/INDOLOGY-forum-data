Bibliography on the Kasikavrtti
Dear collegues,
In a forthcoming volume (Studies in the K&#257;&#347;ik&#257;v&#7771;tti: The Section on Praty&#257;h&#257;ras.
Critical Edition, Translation and Other Contributions (ed. P. Haag and V. Vergiani), Firenze, FUP), we are planning to  publish an updated version of the  Bibliography on the K&#257;&#347;ik&#257;v&#7771;tti prepared by Yves Ramseier a few years ago and available online.
We would be happy to send the current version to anybody who might be interested. In order not to miss any contribution, we would be grateful if you could  inform us about any recent publication on the subject.
Many thanks in advance.
Pascale Haag.
