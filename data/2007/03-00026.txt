Rgvedic recitation
Hi Mark!
You can order ready made CD versions the four Vedic recitations made
by Professor Staal etc here:
http://www.smithsonianglobalsound.org/containerdetail.aspx?itemid=682
You can listen to samples and even purchase the entire album online
there. Also of interest, you can download the original linear notes
from the same site.
I have a copy myself and they are of excellent quality.
Kind regards from Brisvegas!
