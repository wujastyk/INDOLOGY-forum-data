Rgvedic recitation
In 1997, I was able to obtain a custom-made CD reproduction of the  
original album from Smithsonian Folkways. I presume those people must  
be online these days and with some luck, you'll be able to order a CD  
through the internet. I don't recall it was very expensive.
Best wishes,
Arlo Griffiths
