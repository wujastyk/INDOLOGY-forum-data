Dear JN,

There is a mahatmya for the Bhima river. It is, as far as I know,
unpublished, but I have published the chapter on Pandharpur in Acta
Orientalia, Vol. 53, 1992, 86-105.

Emne: river mahatmyas

dear colleagues,

i am collecting information on river mahatmyas. i am especially interested  
to know for which rivers mahatmyas exist.
I know that mahatmyas exist for the Narmada river.
Anne Feldhaus (in her work "Water and Womanhood", 1995) has reported a  
number of mahatmyas for rivers in Maharashtra, i.e. the Godavari, Bhima,  
Payosni (Purna), Tapi, Krsna. Now, all these texts seem to cover a rather  
limited geographical area. My question is: Are there any such texts  
composed for more distantly located rivers?
Any suggestion is highly appreciated.

thanks and best regards

jn
