Bibliography of Hindu Law and Dharmasastra
I am pleased to announce the initial publication of an online 
Bibliography of Hindu Law and Dharmasastra 
<https://mywebspace.wisc.edu/drdavis/web/hindulaw/index.htm> that may be 
of interest to scholars and students on this list.  Full details are 
available at the site itself.  The bibliography is intended to be 
cooperative in nature.  Thus, comments and collaborative contributions 
are most welcome.
Best,
