Dear Mark,

A few more words on this topic. I cannot unfortunately give precise  
references or websites, but recall that an initiative from the EU to  
rank journals came along within the last 1-2 years, and that scholars  
in Leiden (as, I presume, elsewhere) were asked to submit lists of  
journals relevant to their fields or perhaps there were already such  
lists (to which additions could be made). The important step was  
supplying an A, B or C rank behind each journal title. What we simply  
did here was to give the highest rank to all journals in our  
respective fields, regardless of whether they fulfilled requirements  
like being 'peer-reviewed' etc.

Best,

Arlo
