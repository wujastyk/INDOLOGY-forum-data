Soteriology of universals
Will,
   You could argue that meditation on universals (sAmAnya) in Buddhism 
is not directly soteriological (since they are held to be un-real), 
but the negation of them is.  Georges Dreyfus has a discussion of the 
soteriological aspects of Dharmakirti's epistemology in his 
_Recognizing Reality_.
