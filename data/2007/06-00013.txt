Regarding Universities in the Netherlands:

The name of the dept. in Leiden is best given as: Kern Institute /  
Dept. of Indian and Tibetan Studies. The link ought to be to   
<www.kerninstitute.leidenuniv.nl>.

Summer Sanskrit courses are also offered in Leiden: <http:// 
www.letteren.leidenuniv.nl/summerschools/index.php3?m=&c=17>.

The institute in Groningen is called Institute for The Institute of  
Indian Studies, <www.rug.nl/india>.

The International Institute for Asian Studies is neither a  
University, nor does it deal in Sanskrit learning.

PS There must be many more Italian Universities that could be  
included in your list. France seems to be entirely missing, but in  
fact Sanskrit learning is offered there at numerous Universities or  
other academic institutions. Other missing European countries that  
come to mind are Croatia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, ...
