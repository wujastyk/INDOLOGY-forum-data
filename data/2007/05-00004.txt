At the end of his commentary on Maalatiimaadhava 
entitled the Rasama?jarii (Trivandrum Sanskrit 
Series 170, p. 621), Puur.nasarasvatii (ca 1300) 
gives an allegorical meaning for each of the 
characters of Bhavabuuti's play,  without really 
theorizing on his views. But according to his 
stress on the concept of deeper or implicit 
meaning in his Vidyullataa's commentary on the 
Meghasa.mde/sa (cf. Poul Skraep, Orientalia 
Suecana, 27-28, 1978-79, pp. 176-210), I suggest, 
without being a specialist,that his ideas on 
?allegory? (without naming it as such) belong to 
the sphere of the theory of suggestion (dhvani).
Best wishes,
Christophe Vielle
