Dear all,

The sound tape The Four Vedas, Introduction and notes by J.F. Staal, 
recordings by John Levy and J.F. Staal (ASCH Mankind Series Album no. 
AHM 4126) contains the Sa.mhitaa-paa.tha, Pada-paa.tha, Krama-paa.tha, 
etc., recitation of Rgveda 8.100.11. I used to have a copy, but seem to 
have lost it. Is this or similar material available for free download 
(for teaching purposes)?

Regards
Mark
