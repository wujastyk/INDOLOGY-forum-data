Help with English
Friends,
Could some of you help me finding a proper English equivalent for the name of the institution where I teach? (Right now we have no native speakers around.)
In Hungarian it is "A Tan Kapuja Buddhista F?iskola", literally "The Gate of the Teaching Buddhist College".
Stylistic intuitions differ; some suggestions proposed were "Gate of the Dharma", "Dharma Gate", "Gate to Dharma" (and perhaps "Budapest Buddhist University" added). 
Thank you for your suggestions,
Ferenc
