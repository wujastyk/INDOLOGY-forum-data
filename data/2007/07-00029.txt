Patanjali quote (fwd)
One good place to look up scholars of South Asian Studies based on keyword 
searches of their areas of interest is the IDSAS (International Directory 
of South Asia Scholars), which is online as part of SARAI, at:
<http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/indiv/southasia/cuvl/directory.html>
A keyword search on "Orissa" turned up a few good candidates for your query.
Entries in the IDSAS (including many members of Indology) are submitted by 
the scholars themselves, who described their areas of work in their own 
terms, which are all then indexed into the Directory (currently over 800 
scholars are listed). Any Indology members who care to be listed in the 
directory (or who wish to update their existing entries), should contact me 
as per the instruction on the IDSAS page above.
