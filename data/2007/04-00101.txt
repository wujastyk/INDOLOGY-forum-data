European studies on South Asian Languages
Dear M. Huet,
I am currently finishing up my "Regional Report for Europe" for the
upcoming issue of the Yearbook of South Asian Languages and Linguistics
and have included a number of your articles as well. I hope you do not
mind my asking you a few questions with respect to bibliographic data,
which I have so far been unable to obtain. Unfortunately, I have to send
the report off on Monday, so I would greatly appreciate your help.
Is the date (2004) correct for this article? "Design of a Lexical Database
for Sanskrit." COLING Workshop on Electronic Dictionaries, Geneva, Aug.
29th, 2004. 8-14.
And may I ask in what city the following appeared? (That is, the city of
the publisher):
Huet, G?rard & B. Razet (2006). "The Reactive Engine for Modular
Transducers." In Kokichi Futatsugi, Jean-Pierre Jouannaud & Jos? Meseguer
(eds.), Algebra, Meaning and Computation, Essays Dedicated to Joseph A.
Goguen on the Occasion of His 65th Birthday. Springer LNCS 4060. 355-374.
I would greatly appreciate any help you can give me on these matters!
Sincerely,
John Peterson
