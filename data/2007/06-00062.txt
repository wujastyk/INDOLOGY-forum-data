Dear Jonathan,
As far as I know, from the Pali Studies group on Yahoo, the person behind it 
is Ole Holten Pind, who can be contacted at oleholtenpind at mail.dk.
When he announced this last week, the possibility of contributions from 
users was mooted and he replied that this was indeed something he hoped for 
and would encourage.
Best wishes,
Stephen Hodge
