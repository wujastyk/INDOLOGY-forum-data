[Indo-Eurasia] **The Farmer-Sproat-Witzel Model
No, Michael, not the last word. 
Not until you also see to it that a response from Mahadevan is not 
framed by massive moderator notes and long essays of rebuttal.  Let 
dissenting views through to your list without these pre-emptive attacks 
on them.  They smother debate.  They abuse the role of the moderator on 
a scholarly email list.
It is not enough to let Mahadevan  post to your list.  You have to treat 
him fairly.  And make Farmer do so too.
I know that am speaking for many other list members in this matter.  
They have assured me of this.
