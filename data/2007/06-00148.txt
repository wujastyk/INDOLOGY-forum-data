AW: bhAgavatapurANa - translation question - what does zUla              mean?
You mean you may accept the principle of lectio difficilor, but not of interpretatio difficilior?   :^)
Anyhow, I think the second half of the compounds here may be from not from ZUlaH, "pike, spit, javelin"  (assumed by van Buitenen) and later "stake,  stake of exectuion" and "pain, colic,"  but from ZUlA, "harlot." Mayrhofr gives IE possible cognates for the former, with little conviction, and "wohl dravidisch" for the latter, with citations.  Both are also found in Pkt., he says.

Dear colleagues,
It is most distressing to see that van Buitenen so flagrantly  
violates [my] translation rule number 1, which is 'if it sounds  
absurd, it is wrong'. Tagare's translation seems more accurate,  
although aTTa could be rendered as markets rather than food. So the  
meaning will then be that in Kali yuga there is rampant capitalism,  
peddling of Vedas at the crossroads, and the women are harlots. At  
least that makes sense.
Clearly, a semantic study of the the word zUla is in order.
