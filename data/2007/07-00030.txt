Re: Patanjali quote (fwd)
  While    looking  at the indology  study I find    not much work has taken
up  on Orissa, a state of eastern India  where   the culture of north and
south  India meet together  in its religion, art and sculpture, literature ,
painting  and dance etc.
  Regarding   folklore  I dont  see any  reference on  Orissa.
 Can any body help me in getting scholars on  orissa studies i  the context
of Indology  and   orissan folklore?
