Creating an indological digital archive of this type would be a big job, 
and would require substantial funding and organisation.  Not to say it 
couldn't be done, but just that it's not trivial.

Since the DLI and the Universal Library (and other) projects are already 
up and running, it might be more efficient to focus our energies on 
improving and moulding these services to our needs.

For example, the DLI could easily provide the kind of unified book-PDFs we 
sometimes prefer to work with.  Technically, it's really easy.

One of the areas where improvement is urgent is the quality of the 
meta-data.  The cataloguing of items in the DLI is simply awful.

I have had sporadic contacts with the staff in Hyderabad.  And I've been 
in communication with Mike Lesk, one of the consultants on the DLI.  But 
it seems, prima facie, hard to influence the project from outside.
