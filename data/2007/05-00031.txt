Kontinuit?tskonstrukte Sheldon Pollocks und seiner Epigonen" (="From 
Indology to Genocide : The continuity constructs of Sheldon Pollock and 
his epigones").

Pollock's theorizing clearly presupposes a "German indology", although 
he never defines what he means by it (neither does any of Pollock's 
epigones, and that's why I put the term into inverted commas). Without 
the premise of a "German indology", Pollock's entire theory would 
collapse. By implication, this applies to the pronouncements of all those 
who have followed Pollock's rationale (if that's the word for it), among 
them Houben. 


As for *EVIDENCE*, Pollock is wise enough to steer clear of this vexed 
problem altogether, except for a few hints which, however, turn out 
illusory at closer inspection. 

Here is the example from my earlier posting, dated Tue, 9 Jan 2007 
11:42:48 +0100; see http://listserv.liv.ac.uk/cgi-
bin/wa?A2=ind0701&L=indology&D=1&O=D&F=P&P=7612

*****************************

Pollock corroborates his musings on the would-be problematic side of 
indology with the following quote from "the proto-fascist Houston Stuart 
Chamberlain" (whom no one will seriously consider an indologist, I hope):

"Indology must help us to fix our sights more clearly on the goals of our 
culture (...)" (quot. Pollock 1993:86; no reference provided). 

However, Chamberlain's exercise in opacity actually reads (1905:25):
"(...) der Indoarier mu? uns helfen, die Ziele unserer Kultur deutlicher ins 
Auge zu fassen."

I leave it to the discretion of the reader whether this switch from "the 
Indo-Aryan" to "Indology" at the beginning of Pollock's "quote" should be 
attributed to ignorance, charlatanry or whatever, but I, for one, cannot 
see anything "healthy" in this, as Jan Houben has argued.

*****************************

[NOTE: "Charlatanry", according to the OED, is an "action which 
bespeaks a charlatan, and for "charlatan", the book has the following 
definition: "An assuming empty pretender to knowledge or skill; a 
pretentious impostor".
Alternatively, see s.v. "forgery": "The making of a thing in fraudulent 
imitation of something; also, esp. the forging, counterfeiting, falsifying of 
a document".]

None of this has found its way into Houben's assessment of Pollock's 
piece, nor into that of other members of this list who expressed similar 
views. Quite to the contrary. Following Houben's logic, my article, in that 
it examines Pollock's and Houben's claims about "German indology" and 
proves them false, qualifies for being denounced as "an enthusiastic, if 
not desperate, apologetic of nazi-time german indology" (Houben's last 
posting). I have no intention to enter into Houben's distortions any 
further, although readers who cannot check them against my article may 
feel somewhat puzzled.


Anyway, it should be quite clear by now that Houben's narrative is as 
dependent on the concept of a "German indology" as Pollock's. Take it 
out, and both constructs will collapse. But, inadvertently perhaps, that's 
exactly what Houben does in his recent postings.

Houben now decides that "Indology was (...) mainly 'European' in 
character with intensive cooperations between French, British and 
German specialists, and has thus not only been sharing Oriental dreams 
but also a Nazi-nightmare". In what follows thereafter, the term "German 
Indology" is unceremoniously dropped in favour of Houben's new buzz-
word: "Nazi-time European Indology". Should that imply that he plans to 
extend his (hitherto unsustained) claims to a "European Indology" of 
sorts, his debt in evidence would rise accordingly.

However, Houben's position is somewhat incoherent: His 1995 report 
explicitly presupposes a distinct "German indology", as does Pollock's 
1993 article, which provides its basis. As I said, without this assumption 
Pollock's entire edifice would collapse, and Houben's replica en miniature 
along with it. Should he now give up that position, it may be asked how 
this squares with his sustained endorsement of Pollock's piece, and of 
his own 1995 report, of course.

If a third opinion should be called for, here is what Houben had to say 
about this in 2002: "Rather, there are several distinct Western European 
Indological discourses, namely French, German, British, Dutch, Italian, 
Polish and other ones, (...) which all have both local aspects and global 
aspects" [from S. Bhate (ed.), Indology : Past, Present and Future, p. f.].


Should this change of tune indicate that Houben has now realized the 
untenability of his former position, there would be hope that all this could 
be sorted out in a rational manner. But I for one entertain no such hope, 
and would not be surprised if Houben reinvented the issue once again, 
tomorrow or in a few month's time. The very last thing I expect is that he 
will leave behind his epigonal dependence on Pollock and a host of other 
writers, and come up with a genuine case, based on primary and 
verifiable *EVIDENCE*. That is in fact the only point I would have to 
discuss with Houben.


Reinhold Gr?nendahl



[P.S.: In the second instalment of his "bilbiographie raisonn?e", Houben 
feigns to prepare "readers of this list (...) for a book on this subject matter 
announced by Reinhold Gr?nendahl". This presupposes an acquaintance 
with a book that Houben actually can know very little about, and what 
little has come to his attention so far was thoroughly misinterpreted by 
him, be it deliberately or because he simply didn't get my point. At best, I 
can take his tendentious pronouncement as a sorry travesty of the 
"detached scholarship" he ventured to claim on earlier occasions.]
