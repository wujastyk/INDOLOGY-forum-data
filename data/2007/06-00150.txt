Historical query on Pancatantra?
Dear Professor: Could you help with this query?
Greetings,
I am doing some research on the historical context of Panchatantra
and am wondering if you could spend a few minutes of your time to assist
me with a few questions that I have.
1. Panchatantra refers to a Kingdom in Southern India called
Mahilaropya. Did such a Kingdom exist or is the reference incorrect? What 
was
the real name? In which state was this Kingdom in? (Tamil Nadu, Andhra 
Pradesh etc.)
2. What happened to the three foolish princes after their six months
with Vishnu Sharma? The traditional stories claim that they became
wiser and lived happily ever after. There is no other information available
as to what happened to them and their kingdom. My hypotheses is that
their city state was peacefully incorporated into one of the regional
dynasties and they still managed well in life. If this is correct, what
was the name of that regional dynasty?
3. The original manuscript of Panchatantra was lost by the 11th
century. Are there any references as to whether it was due to neglect or
book burning by some faction?
I would be very grateful for any help given as it is very difficult
to find any historical references about Panchatantra. Thank you very
much for yout time and I look foward to your reply.
Kind regards,
Arun Oberoi.
