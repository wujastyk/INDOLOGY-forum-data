help tracing a verse
Madhav,
In the Mbh, this is a standard description of a prosperous kingdom 
(DuHSanta's in 1.62.10, Rama's in 12.29.48) or of the Krta Yuga 
(1.188.88), or both (12.92.1). The opposite is said of the Kali yuga 
or of yugAnta, as in 3.188.69. All of these quoted by Jim below.
A further example is the description of BhISma's regency, at 1.102.2:
01102002a UrdhvasasyAbhavad bhUmiH sasyAni phalavanti ca
01102002c yathartuvarSI parjanyo bahupuSpaphalA drumAH
And the Kali Yuga at 12.70.23:
12070023a vidhavAz ca bhavanty atra nRzaMsA jAyate prajA
12070023c kva cid varSati parjanyaH kva cit sasyaM prarohati
Regards,
Luis
