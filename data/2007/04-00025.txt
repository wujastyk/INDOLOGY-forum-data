Squiggly Underline in Critical Editions
Dear Colleagues,
	The squiggly underline is a modern editorial addition, as Rosane  
Rocher pointed out.  I have not seen it in any mss., Devanagari or  
otherwise.  The question is "Is it used in printed editions other  
than in Devanagari?"  Since it has been used and is used now in  
printed texts, it should be available to represent such printed texts  
in electronic media.  Therefore it should be added to the Unicode  
Standard.  The point of my question is this:  Should we request that  
it be added to the Devanagari block of the Unicode Standard, or to a  
general editorial symbols block?  If it is used in editions of other  
Indic scripts, then the latter.  If it is exclusive to Devanagari  
(because other symbols like the dagger used in Greek and Latin texts  
would interrupt the continuity of the head stroke) then we'd request  
that it be added to the Devanagari block.
	Peter
