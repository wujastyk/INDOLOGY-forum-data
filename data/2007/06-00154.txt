Historical query on Pancatantra?
Dear friends
Please find some comments below:
Horacio Francisco Arganis Juarez wrote:
The northern recesions of PT are indeed set in a city of that name. 
There is no evidence to support the idea that this city was a historical 
reality
There is no evidence to suggest that the princes were anything other 
than a literary creation.
It is unlikely that there was an 'original ms' of the PT - stories 
passed freely between literary and oral traditions. It is better to 
think of it as a cycle or a genre. Cf. this question: 'what happened to 
the original ms of Little Red Ridinghood'?
The reason for this is that the PT is not a single, fixed historical 
document attributable to a single historical/geographical context. It is 
a fluid body of works encompassing many texts and traditions, stretching 
over 1500 years, and spread geographically.
I'd be delighted to discuss this further. Please see my new book:
