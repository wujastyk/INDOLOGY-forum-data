Squiggly Underline in Critical Editions
Dear Colleagues,
	Have you seen the squiggly underline used in critical editions in  
scripts other than Devanagari?
	The squiggly underline is of course used in the BORI critical  
edition of the Mahabharata to indicate a doubtful reading.  Is it  
used in other Indic scripts?  In any other scripts?
	We have prepared a proposal for Unicode for Vedic characters, and a  
few other characters, and would like to include this squiggly  
underline but must know whether it is exclusive to Devanagari or  
not.  If you have seen it elsewhere please let me know right away.   
If you have an image, this would also be helpful.
	Thanks.
	Yours sincerely,
	Peter Scharf
