Sanskrit Software
I have used TeX since the mid-1980s for all my writing, and I've found it 
excellent.  I like a system whose author guarantees that it will never be 
upgraded, and who will send you a cheque if you find a bug.
The next release of MikTeX (already out in a late beta) includes Xetex, a 
fully Unicode-compliant variant of TeX.  Xetex has been available on Macs 
for some time, and people like it.  It allows you to write in any Unicode 
script and font, like Devanagari, Cyrillic and Arabic, all in one 
document, seeing the stuff correctly as you write it, and then having it 
beautifully typeset by TeX for printing or typesetting.  Oh, and of course 
it's all free, as usual for TeX-related software.
