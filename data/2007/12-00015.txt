not me!
my fault.  I can't spell "committee"!  Sorry.
I double-checked Subscribers' Corner before I recommended it publicly, and 
I thought it was pretty okay.  If you've never used it before, you have to 
get yourself a password, but that's easy.  Once you're past that, every 
tick-box has a little help sign by it, so it's self-documenting.  One can 
turn off the mailings while one is on holiday or writing that monograph, 
that sort of thing.
