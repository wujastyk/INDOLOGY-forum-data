Indology and "the disastrous  ideology of the 'pure Aryan              race'"
Apologies to all members of the list who prefer not to here of this topic any more!
Only today, when I tried to reduce the backlog of "deleted messages" filtered out by 
our mailer, I came across Jan Houben's reply dated Thu, 11 Jan 2007 18:03:54 
(along with Paul Kiparsky's copy Thu, 11 Jan 2007 18:07:04) and various other 
postings to this list before and after. (The problem may persist.)
Anyway, I'd like to give an assessment of the debate so far, if I'm allowed that 
privilege. It will be strictly to the point and as short as possible, but it may not be 
ready before Monday.
Besides, I'd like to renew my call upon all list members for any evidence they have 
of a possible connection between indology and "the disastrous  ideology of the 'pure 
Aryan race'" (offlist, if preferred).
Greetings
Reinhold Gr?nendahl
