What was the context of my reference to the attestation in the Nigha.n.tu?
Did I not speak of reducing the resistance? Why take the reference as if it
was made when 'borrowing : non-borrowing' was the issue in the immediate
context? And, again, why ignore the structural similarity of niira pointed
out with the Indo-Aryan words niipa and nii.da? Are views not to be formed
by taking all relevant arguments, those which are for and those which are
against, into consideration?

Could you spell out or summarize the arguments that *definitely or very
plausibly* establish that proto-Dravidian existed in 3000 BC? How does one's
taking this position establish that occurrence of niir, *the specific word
under discussion,* is *documented* to 3000 BC? If the Nigha.n.tu could
change in the manuscript tradition, why could the sources that are used to
postulate the existence of proto-Dravidian in 3000 BC not have changed in
their manuscript traditions?

If the Vedic or Indo-Aryan could borrow, could the proto-Dravidian not do
the same thing? If it could not, what made it impervious to borrowing?

Could little faith or lot of faith not be a matter of how much time one
spends in believing a particular view and/or of whether one takes the
totality of evidence or arguments into consideration?
