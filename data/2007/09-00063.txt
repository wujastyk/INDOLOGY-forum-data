Sad news
Dear Yaroslav,
This is sad news for all of us.  She was a leader not only of Russian 
Indology but of all of us.  Of course, I did not know her as well as you 
and your Russian colleagues knew her, but I do know this: she was 
generous and attentive also to unknown and unpublished graduate 
students, as I was when I first introduced myself to her at one of the 
early Vedic workshops.  She was very generous.
My sincere condolences,
George Thompson
