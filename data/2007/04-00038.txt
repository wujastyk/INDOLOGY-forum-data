Subject: Question regarding sorting order & Visarga
Message-ID: <161227079912.23782.542199031707434629.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear Indologists,

     Harry Spier asked me the following question:  "where does visarga come in the sorting order of
Sanskrit letters?"  Is there a standard placement for the Visarga in the sorting order  that is generally followed these days?
