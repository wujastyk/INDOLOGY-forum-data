Subject: Making the Argument for Sanskrit

Dear Colleagues,
In view of the turn the discussion of the
explosively sensitive topic of the history of
Indology is taking it is probably indeed better
to face this problem in a trans-national context
and keep it for a separate thread (and a section
in the planned Indology FAQ). 
Probably no general rule can be stated about how
to defend and promote the study of Sanskrit in
different countries and in different situations.
If Sanskrit studies are supported by a steady
flow of state subsidy the arguments are indeed to
be addressed to the university policy makers. If
universities are already habituated to attract
and use private sources a full-fledged market
oriented approach is to be adopted. 
In either case it does not seem useful to argue
for Sanskrit in isolation simply because in the
several millennia of its history it always has
been in interaction with non-sanskritic
languages, cultures and literatures. While many
may feel hesitant to adopt a "marketing" approach
for Sanskrit (and other ancient and modern
languages of the Indian subcontinent) because
this might turn out to be self-defiant (at the
end there is no direct economic advantage to be
expected from Sanskrit), a good argument in favor
of keeping Sanskrit provisions at universities
even with low student enrollment is thoroughly
economic: while oak bark is measured per kg,
cinnamon is measured per gram. In other words the
student number criteria valid for psychology or
sociology or religious studies cannot be applied
to what are "small" languages at our universities
but languages with a richer literature and/or
more speakers than many of the European languages
except English. 
Cheers,
JH
