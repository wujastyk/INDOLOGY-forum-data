Inquiry
Hello, Jan,
for a change I am not writing about cocktails or other organisational  
stuff.
Do you know Encyclopaedia Orissana (Od?ia? j?a?na-kosha) published  
in 1963-65 by Utkal University (Utkal?a Bis?vabidya?l?ay?a) ?
If so, is it a good enclyclopedia on Orissan traditions ?
Is there any English translation that you know of ?
Best
G?rard
