The Asian Division of the Library of Congress is pleased to announce the annual Florence Tan Moeson Fellowship (URL: http://www.loc.gov/rr/asian/FTM.html). This fellowship is made possible by the generous donation by Mrs. Florence Tan Moeson, a former cataloger in the Chinese Team of the Regional and Cooperative Cataloging Division for 45 years.
The purpose of the fellowship is to provide individuals with the opportunity to pursue research on East, Southeast, and/or South Asia (including the overseas Asian communities), using the unparalleled collections of the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. The grants are for a minimum of five business days of research and are to be used to cover expenses incurred while engaging in scholastic research at the Library of Congress, in the area of Asian studies (e.g., travel to and from Washington, overnight accommodations, photocopying). Up to 15 fellowships, with amounts varying from $300 to $2,500, will be awarded. Graduate students, independent scholars, community college teachers, researchers without regular teaching appointments, and librarians are especially encouraged to apply. 
Further application details is described in the attached Florence Tan Moeson Fellowship brochure. Applications are accepted online only at http://lcasianfriends.org/application/index.php?sid=4 and must be submitted between June 1st and September 30th every year. The awards will be announced later in December.
