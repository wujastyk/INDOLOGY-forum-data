Making the Argument for Sanskrit
I think we should differ between arguments for Indian studies in general 
(i.e the importance of India, Indian culture etc.) and arguments for 
classical Indology including Sanskrit etc. Both types of arguments are 
important, but we have to link them properly. Otherwise it is quite 
possible that we are said: Ok, we completely agree, Indian studies are 
important, but one minor point can be dismissed: these old-fashioned 
languages. As far as I understand the present-day situation in Indology 
and other antiquities, we have to argue especially in favour of our 
threatened classical departments.
In this sense I suggest an argument like this:
Only the profound knowledge of Sanskrit and Middle Indian languages and 
the literature transmitted in these languages opens the way to a deep 
and differentiated
understanding of Indian culture.
