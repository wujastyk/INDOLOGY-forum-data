Dear Arlo, I have here a work published by the Ram Lal Kapoor Trust, Balagarh, Sonipat, Haryana, in 1979, edited with a Hindi translation by Vijay Pal: VenkaTa-MAdhavIyA RgvedAnukramaNI.  The verse alluded to is 8.13: aitareyakam asmAkaM paippalAdam atharvaNAm | tRtIyaM tittiriproktaM jAnan vRddha ihocyate ||  I do not have the PrapancahRdayam.  Regards, George
