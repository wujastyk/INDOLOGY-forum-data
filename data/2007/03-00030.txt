Question on panchatantra
Prof Kirk is quite correct - this story is not in Purnabhadra's PT, on 
which Rajan's translation (and Ryder's) is based, or any of the 
'Southern' recensions, Hitopadesha, etc. The story does not sound very 
Indic to me - wolves are virtually unknown in kathA or epic literature. 
I don't claim to know Vikramodaya. What I do know of Hertel's work is 
that it is very unlikely to have errors in it.
Hope this helps
