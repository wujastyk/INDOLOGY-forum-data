Hindu critiques of astrology / jyotiSa
Greetings,
I don't have the text in my office for checking, but long ago I have 
made the following note:
Mah?bh?rata 3, 200, 21 We find many that were born under the same 
stars, and on the same lucky days, yet how dissimilar are their rewards 
in the junctures of their pre?vious deeds.
