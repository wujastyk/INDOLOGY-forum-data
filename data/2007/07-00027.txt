Kamasutra 2.10.9 and a question of astronomy
It's a mistake, but the confusion arises because she and the Pleiades 
(kRttikA) were the wives of the  7 RSis. The other 6 were banished to 
the far side of the sky for a lapse in chastity involving Agni 
(disguised as their husbands). ArundhatI saw through his disguise and 
remained faithful, which is why she's still beside her husband in the 
Great Bear.
For someone with very good eyesight (and clear skies) the Pleiades 
group is shaped rather like a miniature version of the Seven 
RSis/Great Bear/Big Dipper. I wonder whether this is how the myth 
arose?
For just about everything else you might want to know about the Seven 
RSis and their families, see:

Banarsidass, 1982.
