AW: Squiggly Underline in Critical Editions
Dear Colleagues,
the Classical Text Editor written by Stefan Hagel
(http://www.oeaw.ac.at/kvk/cte/) produces three differently designed
squiggly underlines (including a double and a bold one) and the offset of
the lines is freely definable. These are just two out off many features
which make this programme - which unfortunately is not for free - highly
recommendable. You can download a free copy and try it for a period of 30
days.
I have used the programme (and its squiggly underlines) in my edition of the
Paatanjalayoga;saastra's Samaadhipaada (sample pages also at
http://www.oeaw.ac.at/kvk/cte/).
Concerning the question of character definition, I agree with Stefan and
Birgit, I see no necessity to include any form of underlining.
Regards,
