Although universals are supposed to be unreal, they are nevertheless object
of meditation. The case is argued in some detail by Jnaanasrimitra in the
Yoginirnaya. The problem arises in connection with the object of the
cognition of an omniscient person (such as the Buddha, etc.). If I remember
correctly, Jnanasrimitra argues that its object is not an infinite number of
individuals, but general properties (dharma) that appertain to all
individuals.

Will,

   You could argue that meditation on universals (sAmAnya) in Buddhism 
is not directly soteriological (since they are held to be un-real), 
but the negation of them is.  Georges Dreyfus has a discussion of the 
soteriological aspects of Dharmakirti's epistemology in his 
_Recognizing Reality_.
