I see I need to be more specific.

Currently we have BA courses (3 years, youngest student aged 19), and in 
September we start our first MA course. Although it is a private institution 
belonging to our Buddhist church of the same name, essentially it is 
sponsored by the Hungarian government. Core curriculum is in Buddhism (with 
specilizations in Sanskrit and Pali, or Chinese, or Tibetan, or Japanese, or 
comparative religion and philosophy, or Dharma teaching, or Budo).
