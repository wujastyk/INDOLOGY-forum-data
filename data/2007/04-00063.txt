1.19.23 	During the eighth, he should receive blessings from priests,
preceptors and chaplain, and see his physician, chief cook and astrologer.

Translation (Kangle [AZ]; Kale [DKC]) In the eighth, the Purohita and
others, assembling relate to the king ? Last night we saw a bad dream; the
planets are not favourably situated; besides the omens are evil; so let
propitiatory rites be performed. Let all the sacrificial implements be made
of gold; when this is done, the rites are prolific in their effect. Here are
these Br?hmans, each like Brahma himself; the benedictory rites performed by
these lead to a blissful result; they are in distressful poverty, have large
families, are constantly engaged in devotional rites, are endowed with
brahmanical lustre and yet have not received any donation; whatever is given
to them will be rewarded by long life accompanied by heavenly happiness and
good fortune. And thus having convinced the king to confer rich donations
upon them, they secretly enrich themselves through these.

Objet?: Hindu critiques of astrology / jyotiSa

Greetings!
     One of my students is interested in researching Hindu perspectives on 
astrology. He is especially concerned with finding critiques of astrology, 
astrologers or astronomy.  We've assembled a basic set of readings that 
will allow him to learn the basics of Indian astronomy/astrology, but I'm 
not confident that those sources (by D. Pingree, M. Yano, Defouw & 
Svoboda, D. Knipe, et al) will provide 'insider' perspectives critical of 
astrology. About the only thing I could think of was Stietencron's article 
("Religious Configurations in Pre-Muslim India...) in the *Representing 
Hinduism* volume, where Somasambhu gives them brief mention.  C. 
Minkowski's "The Pandit as Public Intellectual" is also on the reading 
list, and a colleague has pointed me to an article by Judy Pugh in 
Contributions to Indian Sociology. However, I feel that I've yet to supply 
my student with a source that documents the type of critique that we get 
from someone like Martin Luther in Europe.

     This seems like an excellent topic, but I'm a bit stymied! Any help 
would be much appreciated!  (And apologies for the cross-posting.)

best,
Tim Cahill
