Kiwi indologists or programs??
For a listing of hundreds of South Asianists (not all classical 
indologists!), searchable by country, please go to SARAI (South Asia 
Resource Access on the Internet) at:
<http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/indiv/southasia/cuvl/>
and then click on the link for the International Directory of South Asia 
Scholars. The direct link is:
<http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/indiv/southasia/cuvl/directory.html>
Here you can do a search on, say, keyword, "Zealand" and find a range of 
scholars at Victoria Univ. Wellington, University of Otago, University of 
Cantergury, Massey Univ., Auckland, etc. Eachg entry has full contact 
information, as well as a description of their areas of work.
