Question on panchatantra
A fellow scholar asked me to post this here:
Dean Anderson
      I am doing important folklore-related research and need to learn some details about a story in the Panchatantra.  I have only read a summary of it in another book and have not yet been able to find a full English translation.  According to the summary I read, two women are traveling together with their infants.  While asleep in a forest, a wolf kills one of the babies, and the mother swaps the corpse for the other?s child while the latter is still asleep.  A dispute ensues, and the women appear at the court of Gopicandra, where they present their case.  A wise parrot advises that the disputed child be cut in half.  The true mother objects. This reveals the authenticity of her claim, and she is awarded the child. 
The reference that was given for the story is   Vikramodaya, No. 14 in Hertel?s Panchatantra (1914), 154.   However, this reference appears to be  inaccurate; and I have not been able to find a version of this story in any of the English translations that I?ve looked through.
