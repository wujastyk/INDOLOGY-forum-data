poet Vallatholi
There is a chapter on Vallathol in P. K. Parameswaran Nair's "History of
Malayalam Literature", New Delhi: Sahitya Akademi, pp. 194-208, but I cannot
find any reference to his visit of Santiniketan there;
maybe the monograph "Vallathol Narayana Menon" by B. Hrdayakumari, New
Delhi: Sahitya Akademi 1979 could be more explicit, but I don't have it at
hand just now.

poet Vallatholi
Does anybody provide me with some info on the Kerala poet Vallatholi, 
who supposedly went to Santiniketan in 1939?
Thanks,
