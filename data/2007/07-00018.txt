FW:  Patanjali quote (fwd)
all your thoughts break their bounds. Your mind transcends limitations,
your consciousness expands in every direction, and you find yourself in a
new, great, and wonderful world. Dormant forces, faculties, and talents
come alive, and you discover yourself to be a greater person by far than
you ever dreamt to be."
Although unable to supply chapter and verse offhand, I would be prepared to
bet that the quotation is from the Yogasutra 'translation' by T.K.V.
Desikachar. It sounds very much like his style.
