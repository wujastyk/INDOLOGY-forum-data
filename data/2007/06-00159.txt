Prof Ingalls on Sanskrit OCR
Thank you for the link to the delightful Ingalls Sr./Jr. video, which  
I could watch and enjoy without any problems yesterday. I then  
forwarded the link to several students, but they could no longer  
access the page, and today it is closed to me also. Can anybody  
explain, and is there any (other) way to get access to the video?
