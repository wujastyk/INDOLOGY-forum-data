help tracing a verse
An interesting Buddhified G?ndh?r? version of this verse occurs at
the end of the stotra on Niya Document 511 obverse (ed. Boyer,
Rapson, Senart & Noble):
   sata? subhik??u bhavatu sam?kula
   i?dra? viv?dhi abhivar?adu makhi
   ude?tu sasya c?a jay?ya p?rthiva
   cira? sa dharma sugatasya ti??hatu
Burrow translates this as:
   Let there always be good begging and plenty;
   let Indra the lord of sacrifice rain increase;
   let the crops come up and the king (go forth) to victory.
   May he long abide in the law of the Blessed One.
which I would consider modifying as follows: (1) sata? maybe
rather gen. plur. of sant? ?for good people?; (2) makhi maybe =
Skt. magh? ?a species of grain L.? (MW s.v. magh?), and object of
abhivar?adu like viv?dhi, rather than unattested derivative of
makha ?feast, sacrifice?; (3) dharma may be nominative and subject
of its sentence:
   Let there be good begging and plenty for good people,
   let Indra produce increase (of) grain by rain,
   let the crops grow up, let the king (go) to victory,
   may the law of the Blessed One last a long time.
This version thus contains the same key elements as the
original(s): Parjanya/Indra is asked to produce rain; the crops
(sasya) may grow; the role of the king is addressed (may he be
righteous / victorious); and so is religious welfare (may the
brahmans may prosper / may the dharma last).  For subhik??
cf. also the third MBh verse cited by Jim Fitzgerald.  Finally,
note the replacement of Paryanya by Indra, who of course is often
identified with the former.
