Subject: 12 Names of Surya
Message-ID: <161227079383.23782.11322339617063092697.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear List members,

A friend of mine who is an Iyengar Yoga instructor is interested in knowing
where the list of 12 names of Surya included in the Iyengar practice 
manual may come from.

They are: mitra, ravi, sUrya, bhAna, khaga, pUSan, hiraNyagarbha, marIci,
Aditya, savitR, arka, and bhAskara.

Does anyone know a text that lists these particular 12 as the names of 
Surya? I know there are other lists in the Mahabharata and elsewhere, 
but so far as I'm aware these include some different members.

My apologies for cross-posting.
