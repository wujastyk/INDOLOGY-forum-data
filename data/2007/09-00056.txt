Dear Indologists,
 
Prof. Edwin Gerow mentions ca. sixth century CE as the date of nATyazAstra  
in his article "Jayadeva's Poetics and the Classical Style," in JAOS Vol. 109,  
No. 4. (Oct. - Dec., 1989), p. 541. Is there a consensus among Sanskritists  
regarding this date?
 
Thanks in advance.
 
Regards,
S. Palaniappan
