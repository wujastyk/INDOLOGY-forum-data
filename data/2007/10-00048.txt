I just notice that the Library of Congress copy of this book:

LC Control No.:    unk81050111 
Personal Name:     Rosen, Friederick A. [from old catalog]
Main Title:        Corporis radicum sanscritarum prolusio. 
Published/Created: Berolini:  Apud Ferdinandum Dummlerum, Typicis Academicis, 1826.
PK901 .R7 1826a

Has the following inscription in pencil after the author's name:

Tam merito laudatus et ploratus
Ab illo non minus lugendo citiusque pariter erepto
Eximio viro
C.F.L.S.P.B__

Does anyone have any idea whom the initials might belong to?

It is probably not pertinent, but this copy is slightly different from another (LCCN 11024033; PK901 .R7) which has on the title page the same title with "Dissertatio Inauguralis..publice defendet, Opponentibus..." and after the final page a Curriculum Vitae and Theses 1-5.  The first copy has Phil.Dr. after the author's name?

Was it customary at the time to publish a dissertation with a different t.p. before and after the successful defense?
