Nearness and Respective Correlation
Colleagues:
Otto Harrassowitz has decided not to keep in print my 1995 monograph on 
the history of the interpretations of Astadhyayi 6.1.77: iko yan aci. 
Therefore, it is being sold very cheaply until December 2007. I have not 
been able to find it listed on their website, but if you write to 
verlag at harrassowitz.de I'm sure they will be able to help you out. The 
ISBN is 3-447-03631-1.
Best,
Bob Hueckstedt
