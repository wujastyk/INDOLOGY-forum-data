crisis at the Ecole Pratique
Can anyone comment on the significance for Indology, and for the EPHE in
particular -- if any -- of the mooted reforms of the French university
system described in the latest Economist?
See:

The article refers at length to the policies of Val?rie P?cresse, one
of the officials designated to receive our letters of protest.  How
might the EPHE figure in all of this?
