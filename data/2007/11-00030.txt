Nira-Narsingpur Narasimha, Lakmii-n.rsi.mha-sahasra-naaman
I think Ashok would be well-advised to take a look at the Dravidian  
Etymological Dictionary before he suggests that niira is not a  
Dravidian word.  It is rather strange that after the two language  
families (Indo-Aryan and Dravidian) have been intermingled for  
millennia scholars are still reluctant to admit mutual influence.  In  
fact, the influence is considerable both ways.  I am working through  
the Akananuru, one of the Sangam anthologies, and find several IA  
words that repeat -- the total number of such words is about 2-3%.   
Many are borrowed through Prakrit and, interestingly, there is a  
limited number of such words which repeat over and over (e.g. kaamam,  
kaalam, tiru < srii).  The fact that this vocabulary is far more  
limited than it is even in the Cilappatikaaram is a strong argument  
for its date, which is almost certainly 1-3rd century AD.  It might  
also be pointed out that the technique of suggestion (called uLLuRai  
in Tamil) is far more developed and prevalent than in any major  
Sanskrit or Prakrit works.  There are many aspects to Dravidian-Aryan  
influence (or, perhaps more accurately, synthesis) than have been  
realized and discovered to date.  George Hart
