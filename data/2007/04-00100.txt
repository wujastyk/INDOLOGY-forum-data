(Crossposted to Vyakaran and Indology)

Can anyone make any suggestions about something that might help a high school student write dramatic dialogue representing "an Indian accent," something that would be intelligible to someone at that level or at least his teacher.  I presume the querent also meant to include grammar and vocabulary as well as intonation.

Thanks,

Allen
