Sanskrit to be an elective subject in schools
Dear Indologists,
I am an absolute novice in this area. Therefore, I can ask the following 
question without oo much embarassment:
Why do some Indians object to Sanskrit's being named the official 
language of India? Is it not 'better' than English, which is a totally 
alien tongue on the Subcontinent?
I appreciate your replies.
Gregor
