Journal of Buddhist Ethics
hi thomas!
hope you had a good vacation.
i think the electronic journal a great idea, but the title: journal of
buddhist ethics will not fly (at least among the hardnosed smart-ass 
accountants.).
i would love to be involved in any way you think fit. i suggest you start it
as a newsletter as a first start.
you will need to first decide the following.
1. ftp site for housing the papers.
2. format for the papers. most sites use .dvi and .ps.
3. paper style and bibliographystyle. bibtex files are popular.
   apalike. ieee, harvard, chicago are popular.
i think it would be a great idea to carefully screen papers so that
the credibility is maintained...no bullshit that appears in one of the
official bogus journals. i think rigor would be very important.
anyway let me know what happens.
