hi thomas!

hope you had a good vacation.

i think the electronic journal a great idea, but the title: journal of
buddhist ethics will not fly (at least among the hardnosed smart-ass 
accountants.).

i would love to be involved in any way you think fit. i suggest you start it
as a newsletter as a first start.

you will need to first decide the following.

1. ftp site for housing the papers.
2. format for the papers. most sites use .dvi and .ps.
3. paper style and bibliographystyle. bibtex files are popular.
   apalike. ieee, harvard, chicago are popular.


i think it would be a great idea to carefully screen papers so that
the credibility is maintained...no bullshit that appears in one of the
official bogus journals. i think rigor would be very important.

anyway let me know what happens.

> 2. ABOUT THE JOURNAL
> 
> AIMS
> 
> The Journal of Buddhist Ethics has been established to promote the
> study of Buddhist ethics through the publication of research
> papers, discussion articles, bulletins, and reviews.
> 
> DESCRIPTION
> 
> The Journal of Buddhist Ethics is the first academic journal
> dedicated entirely to Buddhist ethics, and is innovative in
> adopting a totally electronic mode of publication. In most other
> respects, however, it will function as a traditional scholarly
> journal. Research papers and discussion articles submitted to the
> journal will be subject to blind peer review.
> 
> THE CONCEPT OF AN ON-LINE JOURNAL
> An on-line journal differs from a traditional journal in publishing
> electronically as opposed to a printed format. The Journal of
> Buddhist Ethics will also publish material on an on-going rather
> than a periodic basis, eliminating any backlog between acceptance
> and publication. An on-line journal is NOT the same as a newsgroup,
> discussion list, or bulletin board.
> 
> WHY PUBLISH ON-LINE?
> 
> On-line journals are a logical development in the use of
> information technology. The dissemination of information through
> this medium has three main advantages over publication in the
> traditional manner, namely, cost, speed, and ease of access. Other
> advantages of an electronic medium include keyword searching and
> the use of multimedia and hypertext formats.
> 
> EDITORIAL POLICY
> 
> The Editors are committed to the widest dissemination for research
> published by the journal. As well as publishing on-line they will
> also explore possibilities for the publication of selected material
> in partnership with traditional presses.
> 
> CITATION INDEXES
> 
> The journal will be searched by the usual citation indexes for this
> subject classification.
> 
> 3. SUBJECT CLASSIFICATIONS
> 
> The Journal of Buddhist Ethics interprets "ethics" as including
> subject matter in the ten areas listed below.

> 
> 4. GLOBAL RESOURCE CENTER
> 
> In conjunction with the journal an on-line Global Resource Center
> has been established with the aim of providing research tools for
> scholarship in the field of Buddhist ethics. Projects currently
> planned include a bibliography of publications in Buddhist ethics
> and a register of research in progress. Further possibilities
> include an electronic archive of relevant periodical literature,
> and the production of teaching materials for use in undergraduate
> courses. At present the Center provides World Wide Web links to a
> wide range of electronic resources in Buddhism. It can be accessed
> by following the instructions under "World Wide Web Browsers" in
> the section entitled "How the Journal Works".
