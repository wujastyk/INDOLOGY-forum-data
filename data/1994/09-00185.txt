Look, and I am sure that I do not speak for everyone, but I for one am 
sick and tired of having my mailbox clustered by these anti-Muslim, 
semi-fanatic hate-orientred messages. Dileep Karanth's latest posting 
about the banning of the Quran is the last straw (for me anyway).
 I think authors of such mail should keep their postings private (i.e., 
between the concerned parties of the discussion).  I am in no way trying 
to hamper the free expression of thoughts, but the series of postings 
over the past month have proven that...certain parties are only 
interested in communicating the "hidden truth" of Indian history that 
they believe Western scholars to be covering up.  Might I suggest that 
these 
parties READ some of the "Western" (is JNU material Western? (rhetorical, 
of course)) scholarship before making erroneous judgments and leaping to 
false conclusions.
