PC Windows Devanagari?
I had posted one note recently on  the topic but I misspelled the 
address. Here is a complete copy of the announcement
 INPROS is pleased to announce the release of
    DEVNAGARI Fonts for MS- Windows and Mac
 These are extraordinarily high quality fonts being offered
                    at
   an equally extraordinary price of $15.90 +S&H for
           a set of three fonts.
This offer expires on Diwali 1994.
You can get a sample of SheelRekha in UUENCODED file
via e-mail by contacting InProS at info at inpros.com
The sample font contains some very nice symbols like Om,
Namaste, Ganesh(swastika), Trishul and many others. Just
for that it is worth getting a copy of the sample.
