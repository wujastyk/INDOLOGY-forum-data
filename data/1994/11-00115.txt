Hi Dominik,
I wouldn't say it was "important" but I sent a note to Julia on the dates in
question thanking her for some suggestions about what to read on women in
India for a lecture I've foolishly offerred to give. Please pass on my
thanks again, and I hope you had a great time in the Maldives.
Best,
Damien
