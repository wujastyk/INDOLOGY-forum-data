In his introduction to the book Semantic Networks in Artificial 
Intelligence, Fritz Lehmann writes the following in a footnote: 
"In the 1960's, I saw a network language called `Shum' (in a 
Shum Foundation publication) created to express the fundamental 
ideas of the great eastern religions; since then I've never found 
any references to Shum." 
  
Mr Lehmann has written to me asking if I have any data on Shum. 
I have none.  Anyone on this list have any leads?
