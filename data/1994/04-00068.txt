Library Computerisation (information requested)
Dear Indologists,
I am glad that I am able to communicate with this group of indologist
while staying in Paris for a few months.
1. I would be very much interested to know what sort of programmes
have been used for the computerisation of the main indological
libraries around the world.
2. I wonder whether any one of you has got experience
with the CDS/ISIS developed by UNESCO.
Any information on these two points is most welcome.
Thanking in you in advance,
With regards,
S. A. S. Sarma,
French Institute, Dept. of Indology, Pondicherry.
