"The program will be administered in India by AIIS staff.  This is an
   intensive language program which provides four hours of classroom
   instruction five days a week.  Classes are small and individual
   tutorials are provided.  There will be regular assignments outside of
   class, and participants must take part in all program events, such as
   attending films, plays, and other cultural activities.  This is not a
   research program; participants are expected to devote all their
   energies to activities which will increase their competence in all
   areas of language skills--speaking, listening, reading, and writing."

Sometimes a few scholarships available for Indian-academic-year HINDI

The scholarships are modest, but then so are the costs involved.  The
   real price is having to deal with the Indian bureaucracy.
