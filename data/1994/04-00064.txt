The Bene Israel (Sons of Israel)
	Can anyone supply me with a few "get-started" references on the
Jewish community called the "Bene Israel" ("Sons of Israel")?  They are
the oldest Jewish community in India and still, apparently, the largest
(says Stanley Wolpert, India).  They are a Maharashtrian jati of 
oil pressers.
