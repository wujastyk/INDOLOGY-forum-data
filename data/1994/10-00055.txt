Subject: SANSKRIT SPEAKING VILLAGE

          I think the Sanskritophone village was the subject of  an article 
          in  the  last  year  or  two  in either of  the  two newsweeklies 
          Frontline or  India  Today,  both  of  which  I  get  for current 
          reference but which I don't have time to search now.
