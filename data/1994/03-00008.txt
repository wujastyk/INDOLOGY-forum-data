Subject: INDIAN JEWISH FEMALE SKTIST(S)

          A  patron asking for information on Indian Jewry wanted the  name 
          and address of  an Indian Jewish woman working on Sanskrit at the 
          Maharajah Sayajirao University of Baroda, one  with  a  name  one 
          would take to be Jewish.  A computer search based on  a hunch led 
          me  to Esther Solomon, though from  the places  of publication of 
          her works I wonder if she lives in Ahmedabad rather than Baroda.  
          I  seem however  to remember another Indian Jewish female scholar 
          works  or worked  on Jainism and Prakrit.  (The  works  of  Prof. 
          Solomon  in   the  Library  of  Congress  focus  more   on  Hindu 
          philosophy.)  Does this  ring  a  bell  with anyone?  Does anyone 
          have  an  address  for  Dr.  Solomon  or  the  hypothetical other 
          scholar?  We  are not entirely sure that either of them is Indian 
          by  birth rather  than  by  long residence or naturalization. The 
          Baroda scholar was supposed to  have  retired  in  the  last  few 
          years. 
           
          Thanks for your assistance.
