This is a most interesting discussion!

I am wondering if anyone would care to comment on the theory
of the "Nostratic" language, mentioned in the following
passage from the book "Dancing with Siva", H.H. Sivaya
Subramuniyaswami, isbn 0-945497-48-2, 1993: (page 609)

	"Many scholars today of both East and West believe that the
	people of the Rig Veda who called themsevles Aryan were
	indigenous to India, and there never was an Aryan invason.  The
	various langugaes of India have been shown to share common
	ancestry in ancient Sanskrit and Tamil.   Even these two
	apparently unrelated languages, according to current
	"super-family" research, have a common origin: an ancient
	language dubbed Nostratic.  Finally, there is an ever-increasing
	amount of physical and scriptural evidence that describes a
	gradual evolution of religion and culture in India from
	prehistoric lifestyles to today's rich ethnic diversity."

The Aryan/Dravidian invasion discussion has been interesting, but
has certainly digressed.

Gentlemen, though a newcomer to this list, may I humbly suggest that
personal attacks have no place here?   It is painful to see eminent
scholars use their intellects as weapons.  Please let peace prevail.  I
offer for your enjoyment 17 couplets of the ancient Dravidian poet,
Tiruvalluvar.  Apologies for the length.  

Om Shanti

     By a single word of injury 
     Do all a man's virtues lose their goodness.

     Possess the ascetic's remarkable exceptional rare purity.

     Verse 160

     But they are surpassed by those who suffer hard words spoken.


     Eloquence

     Verse 641

     Among a man's many good possessions, 
     A good command of speech has no equal.

     The content of worthy speech binds friends more closely, 
     And its eloquence draws even enemies to listen.

     Verse 644

     Judge the nature of your listeners and speak accordingly.  There
     is nothing more virtuous or valuable than this.
