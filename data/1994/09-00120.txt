Qualifications for entering into a debate
Dear Mr Deshpande,
I do not need to read a few thousand pages to be sure that a mail which 
says that somebody believes that "anything goes" without actually giving 
us his argument is not acceptable. 
I am glad you at least took the trouble to read my posting, if only to 
criticise it on some trivial grounds. I will let you get back to reading 
the few thousand pages which (and not an open mind) are the 
qualifications recognised by the Dominik-fan club. 
You have not yet grasped the point that I am only criticising the 
attitude of using authority to settle disputes. Or perhaps you have, but 
you use the same strategies yourself (and so have been initiated into the 
inner circle of indologists) 
Again, the fact that you have no arguments to defend your supercilious 
behaviour is clearly brought out by the fact Jiten Sharma's polite and 
sincere questions (which ignore your impolite behaviour) are as yet not 
answered. 
Maybe I should not even expect sane arguments in a discussion group where 
a person who criticises a purely private discussion in public is called a 
gentleman. 
"Ushtranam hi vivasheshu mantran gayanti gardabhah,
Parasparam Prashansanti aho roopamaho dhvanih"
Please go back to scratching each others backs, ushtras and gardabhas.
Dileep
