I have heard many different versions of this story. Answer-man Cecil
Adams dealt with this question in a recent edition of his column
"The Straight Dope". I don't have it any more, but as I recall, Adams'
research showed that there had been a proposal to translate government
documents into German. It did get voted on, but didn't pass -- and
the vote was nowhere near as close as one vote.
