Bay Area Sanskrit class?
Dear indolofy-listers,
I am very interested in learning Sanskrit for further study of Buddhism. 
Can anyone on this list inform me of Sanskrit classes held in the San 
Francisco Bay Area?
I work on weekdays; therefore, the classes would need to be held evenings 
or on weekends.
If there are no classes, could anyone recommend a good textbook/program?
Thanks!
