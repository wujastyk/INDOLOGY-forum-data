Miroslav,
	One True type font designer that I have used and that I am
quite impressed with is a program called Fontmonger which costs
approximately $100.00 U.S..  This program not only enables one to
create a new font face and to make changes to existing font faces,
but also to convert fonts from one format (incl. Macintosh) to
another.  If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me
directly.
