Indic etexts and Macs---> what about windows?
 If it's any use to anyone, we have developed a Truetype font based on Times for the Mac which translates into Wndows through the Converters supplied with Microsoft Word./
 I am preparing a transcript of prof. Tokunaga's work in that font - not an easy task with a small computer.
 All the best,
