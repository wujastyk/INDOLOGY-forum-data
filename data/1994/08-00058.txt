Address of B. van Nooten
Unfortunately, Prof. Van Nooten has not submitted an entry to The
International Directory of South Asia Scholars, so he cannot be found
through the South Asia Gopher.

Re: Address of B. van Nooten
Please note that Frits Staal already retired some three years
ago from the Dept. of South and Southeast Asian Studies at UC
Berkeley, Ca. 94720.  I also heard that both Jaini and Van Nooten
planned to do the same this year.  But I am sure that Barend van 
Nooten could be reached through that department.  Good luck.
