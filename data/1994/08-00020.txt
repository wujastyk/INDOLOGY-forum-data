As many of you know, work has been underway for some time on the new
Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosopy. This encyclopedia, due for
publication in 1999, will have considerably more on Indian
philosophy than the Encyclopedia of Philosophy edited by Paul
Edwards and published by Macmillan in 1967. It will also contain
substantially more on the philosophies of East Asia and on Islamic
and Jewish philosophers.

Most of the articles for the Indian and Tibetan philosophy section
have been contracted, but no authors have yet been found for several
important entries, which are listed below. In order to keep
production on schedule, any entries for which no contracts are
issued within the next month or six weeks will have to be dropped.
In order to avoid the regrettable loss of entries, I am asking all
of you to help me quickly find people who might be interested in
writing on any of the subjects listed below.

Obviously, the more information you can provide on how to contact
potential authors by telephone or e-mail, the better my chances of
contacting them in time to meet the deadline.

Please note that the intended readership of the REP is to be
philosophers and students of philosophy, so the ideal author will be
someone capable of writing with authority on Indian philosophy for
people who are not specialists in Indology (or indeed in Indian
philosophy) but who do have a general familiarity with philosophical
issues. A list of people who have already been contracted to write
articles follows the list of articles for which we still seek
authors.

Please do not hesitate to suggest yourself, if you have a special
interest and expertise in one of the listed topics. Alternatively,
you may wish to suggest a particularly promising graduate student
whose work you know and recommend. The final deadline for the
completed entries is July 15, 1995. Routledge is paying 40 pounds
sterling per 1000 words.

Please contact me directly rather than replying to this list. My
address is at the end of this message.
