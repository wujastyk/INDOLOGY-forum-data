This theory has been propounded mainly by the Kanchi Kamakoti Sankara
Mutt, mostly to prove their antiquity compared to the four 
"canonical" mutts established by Sankara.

The 5th Century BC date of Sankara has been effectively refuted by
many people.  The most available analysis is the one contained in
the introduction to "Sankara Digvijaya -- The Traditional Life of
Sri Sankaracharya", translated by Swami Tapasyananda of the Madras
Ramakrishna Math.

Proponents of the Sringeri Sankara Math (Karnataka state) have also
been very vigorous in combating the rewriting of history by the 
5th Century BC advocates, since such a theory directly affects 
the history of their mutt as well.
