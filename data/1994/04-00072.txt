Help!  Urgently need to consult the Jaina *Brhatkalpasutra* and commentary,
to complete some research.  OCLC only lists Library of Congress as having
this, and it turns out they only have vol. 6 (of the six volumes of the
1942 edition pub. by the Sri Armanand Jain Sabha).  If anyone knows of
holdings of the other five volumes, and how to access them, would be very
appreciative.

  The University of Chicago Library has a microfilm copy of all six of
the published volumes of the Brhatkalpasutra in the Srijaina-
Atmananda-grantharatnamala.  It appeared as volumes 82-84, 87, 88,
and 90 in the series.  The text contains the Laghubhasya by 
Sanghadasa Ganin and the Vrtti by Malayagiri and Ksemakirti.  Our
catalog entry is:

  Sthavira-Aryabhadrabahusvamipranitasvopajnaniryuktyupetam
  Brhatkalpasutram :
  Srisanghadasaganiksamasramanasankalitabhasyopabrmhitam :
  Malayagirisuribhih prarabdhaya Sriksemakirttyacaryaih purnikrtaya ca
  vrttya samalankrtam / tatsampadakau Caturavijaya-Punyavijayau.
  1933-<1942>  v. <1-6,  > ; 28 cm.  (In Prakrit with comms. in Sanskrit
  and pref. in Gujarati.)

  The microfilm was made from the copy held by the L.D. Institute in
Ahmedabad.  We only have the film in negative form now, but would be
happy to make a positive reading copy for you for interlibrary loan.
