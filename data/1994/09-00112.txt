Aryans and Dravidians
I seem to have a special knack for making myself mis-understood on this
list.  I did not (or did not intend) to suggest, as Bo Sax says, "that we
close the discussion now to
avoid further acrimony. "  I meant merely to suggest that it should be
possible to carry on the discussion (for as long as the participants have
energy and interest) in a spirit of mutual respect and of civility,
avoiding the urge to shift the focus from the "facts" (such as they may be)
to the personalities of the discussants.  This is not a call to end the
discussion, but merely to moderate its tone.
