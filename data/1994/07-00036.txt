Dear colleagues,

By now I hope everyone who is interested in modern language study has 
seen the several posted replies about the South Asia Gopher on 
ColumbiaNet and esp. the ILM (Inventory of Language Materials) files 
included in it.  We now cover a number of modern languages and hope to 
add more soon--our Marathi list is in the process of being made, by 
Eleanor Zelliot.  Soon we hope to have Sanskrit teaching materials listed 
as well; a compilation is being made by Nadine Berardi.  With others to 
come, as various volunteer editors complete their work.  We have only 
recently taken the ILM lists online, after some years as a modest 
hard-copy project, and there is much scope for development.  
Comments, suggestions, and inquiries about the content of ILM should go to 
me; about the technical computer side, queries should go to David Magier 
(magier at columbia.edu).  Are there more volunteer editors out there who 
would like to help with some particular language?
