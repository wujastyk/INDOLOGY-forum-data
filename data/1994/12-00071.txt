Lack of ambiguity is of course exacltly the minimum criterion of a good
transliteration scheme.  Other criteria are ease of use on a variety of
systems and transferability across the network.  These qualities were also
met by Michio Yano's and mine.  Mine in addition has the virtue of
requiring a single key stroke for each Sanskrit sound.  This makes it
faster to type with, leaves fewer characters to store and leaves nothing to
context when it comes to transliterating to another Font.

All of this is irrelevant since we are not speaking of anything but what is
common to all these machines and to the usual roman upper and lower case
character set.

We are speaking of the roman script used exclusively for Sanskrit, not for
mixing languages.  This is the use required when making a large file of
Sanskrit Text.  When making data files of Sanskirt text it is unnecessary
to use a scheme which makes distinctions between English and Sanskrit at
the expense of the factors I mentioned above under criteria of a good
transliteration scheme.

My remarks were adressed to promoting adequate and useful input of Sanskrit
texts in the wake of recent input that left room for improvement.  Let us
hope that others discern the reasonableness of my suggestions.

Michio Yano has been thoughful to publish his.  I would like to see the CSX
and Peter Schreiner's.
