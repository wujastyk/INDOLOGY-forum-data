ACADEMIC BOOK SERVICE
I trust the following brief advertisement will not be considered
inappropriate on this list.
A recently retired colleague is trying to start up a
second-hand book service for academics and students in the UK,
especially but not only in the following subject areas:
classics * history * indology & oriental * philosophy *
psychology * theology * religious studies * politics
Requests for booklists, stating area(s) of interest, can for
the moment be forwarded via my email address: p.g.moore at ukc.ac.uk
Please head requests and enquiries as  RE: ACADEMIC BOOK SERVICE
