Hi, 
I got this address from Sally at University of California at Berkeley.
 I learned that you are involved in Hindi or Indian languages related
works. I will be interested to learn some more what you are doing.
 
I am Bioengineer/Research scientist at university of Michigan Hospitals
(Neurology department). In my part time  I have  developed a software
for IBM PC to learn Hindi. There are two parts to it. In part I, it teaches
alphabets with sound, images, and text. In part II, it extends it to
words and sentences and a word is formed from alphabets and then how a
sentence is formed from words. It is designed in game form so kids
can also learn from it. I may send you more information if you need.
I am working now to develop a FONT for PCs at affordable price compred to 
what are currently available in the market.
 
Thanks 
Ramesh Kushwaha
