Persian does use mausam as a loan word from Arabic, cf. Steingass, p. 1344,
to mean time, season, place of meeting, the season of the Hajj, etc., as
well as in izafat constructions such as mausam-i bahaar, the season of
spring, mausam-i khizaan, autumn, and so on. The Persian usage is probably
the intermediate step for the Urdu borrowing from the Arabic, and then, as
you've shown, the word goes through Portuguese into European languages.
