Introduction
---------------

I am a new member to this group. My interests are Tamil
and South Indian studies. I have a good handwritten list of articles 
and books (Total approx. 35000) on Tamil culturescape.
I am interested in collecting atleast photocopies of
some old Tamil books. The authors are like Tiruchengode
A. Muttucaami KOnaar, C. K. Narayanasami Mudaliyar,
M. R. Kandasami Kavirayar etc.. I am very interested in old
books published from Kongu region. I am willing to pay for
the postage + copying charges.
