Dear Gary, 
I have been using locally available shareware which I must admit did not 
cost me a lot. The font I am using at the moment is called  KANCHI NR. I 
also have another font on my computer called Devanagari but I have found 
this one is not so clear. I will be more than happy to send you a copy of 
these fonts if they are of any use to you.
I must point out that this particular software is very easy to install on 
any Macintosh computer.
