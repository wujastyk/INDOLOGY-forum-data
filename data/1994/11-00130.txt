Help on using Binhex4.0
	I downloaded the first of the Mahabharata files from Washington 
FTP site.  Then I tried unbinhexing it.  The second step did not work.  
Could some Binhex Guru tell me how to use the Binhex4.0 program?  Its 
menus are not terribly obvious to common humans like me.  Thanks.
