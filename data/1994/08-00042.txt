No subject
I did a dissertation on Indian philosophy from a comparative
perspective particulary focusing on the Indian construction of
history.  I would be happy to contribute on that subjec or on issues
on Indian politics.  I can also suggest colleagues who would be
excellent for other topics.  But I first want to see if this is the
correct address.
