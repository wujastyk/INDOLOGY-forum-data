The Varangacarita once again
During the last year or so I have been searching the world for an edition
of Jatacarya's Vara;ngacarita. The book is on microfilm at Harvard (Harvard
Microreproduction Service), but they only supply photocopies of journals.
Our library service has been trying a number of other places, but to no
avail. In spite of the fact that I have bothered the honored members of the
list with this question before, I have to ask once again: Does anyone know
where I might get a copy of the book?
Best regards,
