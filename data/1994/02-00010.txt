In brief, I think it's fundamentally a sound program--and looks/prints
beautifully.  The character set is not yet complete/perfected.  I have
sent a list of 10-12 redundancies & omissions to them and have been told
they are working on them.  Most of the omissions are with combined
letters--also the o-like/degree-symbol-like 'o' which is used for
abbreviations and the normal English period/full stop (which is
needed, after all, as a decimal point).  Oh yes, and the keyboard stickers
include some of the omitted letters which aren't yet in the character set!
I'm confident it's going to be a fine program once it's polished up.
