Subject: ELEPHANT MEDICINE BOOK

          I own a  MS book on the medicine of elephants, written in 'Hindi' 
          (taking that word  in  a  wide sense), with illustrations showing 
          each illness personified as a demonic being attacking an elephant 
          in various bodily parts.  I have never seen another complete copy 
          of this but  a private collector owns a single sheet from another 
          copy. There is nothing like this in any of the published Sanskrit 
          books  on elephants and Gajayurveda I  have seen.  The individual 
          leaf may  be used in  a planned exhibit at another institution on 
          Indian medicine; so finding out  more about the  work  has become 
          more important.  Is anyone familiar with books of this type?  Are 
          there other medical books with illustrations showing the diseases 
          as demons, e.g. on human or equine medicine?  The only ones I  am 
          familiar with are some published eds. of the Kumaratantra showing 
          the diseases attacking children under 16 as demons.
