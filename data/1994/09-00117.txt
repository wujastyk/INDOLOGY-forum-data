Louis Dumont
In reply to a recent question by Nobumi Iyanaga concerning Louis Dumont, I
would like to draw attention to a short article which I have written and
which is called "Louis Dumont et les renon?ants indiens". The article has
not yet come out, and may take some time doing so. Meanwhile I am ready to
send copies to those who are interested and send me their postal address.
