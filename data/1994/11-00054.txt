Political dimension
Thanks to Lance Nelson for his recent forthright posting.
In my earlier communication under the same heading I should have mentioned
the name of Peter Claus in the first paragraph. I value his thoughtful
communications.   
Richard Hayes' recent observation about 'drawing the line' has its
validity. However, in all the situations he has mentioned, we draw a line
with other participants of similar standing involved; in other words, the
process is essentially open and  public although the number of participants
is limited by qualification.  I would have no objection to that sort of
monitoring but do we have the resources (especially when  we do not have
time even to respond to Jonathan Silk's excellent questions)?
