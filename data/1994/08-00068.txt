Buddha-L information
I recall that earlier this summer someone indicated that a Buddhism Listserve
is available.  As a colleague of mine wishes to subscribe to such a list, I
would appreciate someone sending me the listserve information of any Buddhism
listserve discussion groups available.  Thanks!
