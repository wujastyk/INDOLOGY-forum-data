PIE etymology of song
Is Sanskrit "Sangita" (music) a cognate of English "Song"? I get the
impression from Voyles (Early Gmc Grammar, p.36) that this is likely. But I
thought Skt sangita was a compound - sam+gita meaning refined+song where
"gita" = song.
Could someone shed some light on this pls?
Thanks.
