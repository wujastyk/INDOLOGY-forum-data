VHP and United Way
Namaste!  Wrote, in part, Narayan Sriranga Raja:
I submit that Hinduism predates the difference between what is
religious and what is not and that it encompasses all aspects
of individual, cultural and societal life -- including politics.
Why must this latter-day tendency to divide a whole be permitted
to survive?
