books on homosexuality in India
I am compiling a bibliography on homosexuality in different cultures of
the world.  Below is a list of books which I have found related to India &
South Asia; I wonder if anyone could help me by suggesting other sources. 
I am interested in any books regarding homosexuality in India or
neighboring countries, whether in a medical, sociological, moral,
religious, historical, or literary context. 
Thank you for any suggestions.
