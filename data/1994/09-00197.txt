Why He could not get tenure.
     They say He spoke the Vedas, but they had existed all along.  So
He was not the author.  Transmitters do not get tenure.  Additionally,
Kautsa was probably right that the Vedas that He spoke were completely
meaningless.  Fortunately for Him, if He is up there beyond time and
space:  anyaiH ... paridIyamAnaM SAkAya vA syAt lavaaNAya vA syAt?
