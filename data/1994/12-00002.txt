I would like to echo Dr. Deshpande's communication about Prof. Tokunaga's
fantastic contribution to Indology with publication of the E-texts of the two
great Inidan epics. What a feat and a feast for Indologists. frankly, I believe
that these files should be placed at strategic sites around the world, meaning
at Indology and at Coombsquest. After communicating with David Magier at
Columbia he agrees. Maybe Dr. Wujastyk and Dr. Ciolek could comment.
