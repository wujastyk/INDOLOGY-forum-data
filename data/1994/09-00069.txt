the logic of the argument
Lance seems to have misread the point of the debate: we
are not here discussing the relationship of Saiva and 
Buddhist tantra (for which debate his comment is entirely
correct). We are debating the quite different issue of
whether Tantra per se arose from a non-Aryan substrate
or within Brahmanic circles. Also, whether Tantra is
such a monolithic "thing" at all, or just a set
of features of medieval religion that give the appearence
of a distinctive syndrome.
All the best,
