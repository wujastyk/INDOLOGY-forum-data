Buddhism-Tibet: History of Jo-nang-pas
Johannes,
The dates of Ngag dbang blo gros grags pa are 1920-75. These are 
given in a short biography contained in a Chinese edition of the chos 
'byung:
btsan lha ngag dbang tshul khrims (ed):
Jo nang pa'i chos 'byung zla bai sgron me
Kokonor, 1992 ISBN 7-80057-075-4
This book not only contains the complete text of the chos 'byung (if 
I remember right, Tsondu Senghe's edition was missing half a folio) 
but also an extensive supplement (lhan thabs = kha skong) of some 500 
pages to the original history.
