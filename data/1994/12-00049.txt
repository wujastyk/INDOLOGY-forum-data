South Asian languages/SummerSanskrit programs
Dear Frances,
thank you for your reminder about the Summer SANSKRIT some weeks ago. I 
have now decided to teach it myself, again, as in the past few years.
The details will follow. Typically they include something like the 
following:
: Session c. June 26-Aug. 18;
Meets Monday- Thursday each afternoon 3.30-6 p.m.
8 unit course, tuition (last year) $ 2500 (some assistance available for 
High School students only).
If desired, on Campus housing (last summer) $ 2080.
