I recommend you check out the INTERNET CONNECTIONS IN THE INDIAN
SUBCONTINENT menu within the South Asia Gopher. You can reach the
latter as follows:

Simply gopher to: <gopher.cc.columbia.edu 71>; and then navigate down
through the menus as follows (Be sure to use port 71):
CLIO Plus/SELECTED TOPICS/South Asia.

If you have gopher client software, use the following pointer ('bookmark'):
	Type=1
	Name=The South Asia Gopher
	Host=gopher.cc.columbia.edu
	Port=71
	Path=1/clioplus/scholarly/SouthAsia

---------OR-------------

Simply telnet to: <columbianet.columbia.edu>. Once connected to
Columbianet, select the menu item marked "CLIO Plus." Within that menu,
you'll find an item on the list labelled "SELECTED TOPICS: Internet
Resources By Subject" Select that one, and within it you'll find the South
Asia Gopher! 

---------OR-------------

If you use MOSAIC or Lynx or other web-browser, use this URL: 
     gopher://gopher.cc.columbia.edu:71/11/clioplus/scholarly/SouthAsia
