HELP WITH BHOJPURI TRACT
          We have here at the Library of Congress a Bhojpuri tract from the 
          Baptist  Mission   Press,  Calcutta,  dated   1909.    There   is 
          documentation along with  it, possibly by mistake, indicating the 
          text  may  have something to  do  with  Sir George Grierson.  The 
          script is Bhojpuri which our catalogers are unable to read, and I 
          cannot find  a  table  of Bhojpuri Devanagari equivalents.  Would 
          anyone be  able  to  make anything of  this  if  I  send  them  a 
          photocopy (8 short pp.), and to transliterate it according to the 
          LC-ALA table for Hindi, which  I  can supply?  I  would  be  most 
          grateful.
