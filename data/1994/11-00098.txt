The incredible Professor Tokunaga
Michio Yano responded (>>) to my remarks (>) and Jonathan Silk
followed up (>>>)
  Jonathan is correct about my intention, and since I was not crytal clear 
about saying what I meant the first time, allow me this opportunity to
say that I think that the transcription of the epics is a magnificent gift
to the community.  Further, the transcriptions in their released form
are extremely well suited for use: they are not broken, and do not need
to be fixed.  The changes I am suggesting are changes for convenience
of use with some of the systems for rendering Indic in transcription;
for other purposes, e.g. generating a concordance, I will no doubt retain
the transcription with the period as division marker since it is, in some
respects, easier to parse that way.  And, indeed, the changes I am 
suggesting I intend to implement myself.
cheers,
Tom
