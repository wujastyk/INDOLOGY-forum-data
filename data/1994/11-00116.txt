        FREE BOOKS, AND INFORMATION IN ELECTRONIC FILES

        ON: ABIDANCE IN FREEDOM, HAPPINESS, AND REALITY


Some of the best things in life are free. The Society of Abidance 
in Truth (SAT) is now offering some of the "best of the best" 
publications, using electronic publishing. They respond to your 
interest in the great spiritual tradition of nonduality, and the 
profound teachings of Sri Ramana Maharshi.

You can now obtain some of these most valuable materials ever
offered, absolutely free, electronically--mailed directly to your
E-mail address. You can then decide whether you might want
them in the more traditional form of books. If enough people want
them in book form SAT will endeavor to publish them--either by
normal publishing or by subscription. 

Several of the offerings below contain parts of books that are
already published. The incredible RIBHU GITA, for example, is
printed and is now (11/94) being prepared for shipment from India. 
(The first 3 chapters are provided free, as the file RIBHU-1.) 

Parts of other books already published by the Society of Abidance 
in Truth are also available free:

  "RAYS OF THE ULTIMATE" (the first part available free as RAYS-1),
  "NIRGUNA MANASA PUJA" by Sri Sankara (see the file NIRGUNAD), and 
  "WHO WE REALLY ARE" by Master Nome (a discourse, in file WHO-1)

SAT also tells you about great books from other publishers. Two of
the offerings below (TREAS-1 and TREAS-2) are book lists of hard-
to-get spiritual books (on Sri Ramana Maharshi, TREAS-1) and the 
intercultural tradition of nonduality (TREAS-2). These lists can be
obtained from the SAT book service, "Treasures of the Heart."
These are treasures indeed. TREAS-1P and TREAS-2P also give prices.
