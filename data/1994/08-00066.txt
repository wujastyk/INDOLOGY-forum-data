Suggestions for research topic..
The authority on the subject is David Pingree who cannot be reached by
e-mail.  I suggest you read his book in the History of Indian Literature
series edited by Gonda on Indian Science and Mathematics.  There is plenty
of primary material available back to the time just after Alexander.
