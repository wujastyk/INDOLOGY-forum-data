Query on Indo-Aryan initial consonant clusters
Dear fellow subscribers!
In connection with recent research on syllabification of initial
consonant clusters in Sino-Tibetan (and elsewhere) I would like
to inquire whether there is any book or aticle that summarizes
reconstructions of (Proto-)Indo-Aryan initial consonant clusters
and sketches their development in Vedic, Avestan, Sanskrit and
Middle Indic.
Any pointers will be highly appreciated.
Thanks, Wolfgang
