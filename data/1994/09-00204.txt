statistical data
Does anyone know where I can find the following information:
1. Names of towns and cities in India with their longitudes and
   latitudes.
2. Demographic data, by state, on:
   tribes, their names, and number of people in each,
   castes (subcastes), their names, and number of people in each,
   languages, their names, and number of people in each.
   dialects of each language, their names, and number of people in each.
   other social and cultural characteristics such as:
   number of different dress styles, cuisines, etc.
Thanks for your help.
