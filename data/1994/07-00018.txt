Announcing ANU-Buddha-L wais dbase on Coombsquest gopher 
Dear Colleagues, 
With apologies for any cross-posting, 
========================================== 
ANU-Buddha-L wais dbase on Coombsquest gopher 
========================================== 
The Coombsquest gopher - Social Sciences and Humanities 
Information Facility at ANU, has been further enhanced by 
the latest addition of an online WAIS database called 
'ANU-Buddha-L' which archives transactions and scholarly 
exchanges of 600 + subscribers to the BUDDHA-L - Buddhist 
Academic Discussion Forum <BUDDHA-L at ULKYVM.LOUISVILLE.EDU> 
At present the database contains 4.5 Mb od data worth of 
high quality BUDDHA-L e-mail messages from the period July 
1993 - June 1994. More data (including earlier log files ) 
are planned to be regularly added in the forthcoming months. 
The database has been constructed as a co-operative project 
involving Richard P. Hayes, McGill Univ, Canada; Jim Cocks, 
Univ. of Louisville, USA and T.Matthew Ciolek, Australian 
National Univ, Australia.
