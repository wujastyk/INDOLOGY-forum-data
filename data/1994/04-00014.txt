National languages
This has nothing to do with Indian languages, although I might add to Prof.
Hayes' comment about Greek that the "founding fathers" also almost made Hebrew
the national language of the US. (Perhaps both these tales are apocryphal?)
Anyway, might someone please tell me the date of death for the late Professor
TRV Murti? In a piece of writing I want to refer to him, and I want to include
his dates. Thank you. --Nathan Katz
