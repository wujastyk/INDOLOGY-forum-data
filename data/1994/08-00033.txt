Panjab Notes and Queries
Dear Fellow Netters,
	I am trying to talk the Centre for South Asian Studies at the 
University of Toronto into purchasing microfilmed copies of a series of 
journals published in the mid to late nineteenth century.  The names of 
these are as follows:  Panjab Notes and Queries (1883-85 ... I think) as 
well as North Indian Notes and Queries.  I have a strong feeling 
that the Centre will indeed buy these, however, the Interlibrary Loan 
Office has been unable to locate copies of these two publications.  Would 
any of your respective institutions carry copies of the journal(s) and if 
so would they be willing to microfilm them?  Any information will be 
greatly appreciated.  Thank you.

Re: Tantric Sources
Contact Prof. Gudrun Buehnemann at UW in Madison, Wisconsin.
She had been working in that particular area. She might be 
able to direct you.  As far as I know she is not on this
mailing list.  You may have to use snail mail.  Edeltraud.

  The Nehru Memorial Museum and Library in New Delhi has already
filmed the title for Oct. 1883 through Sept. 1886.  Either Toronto
could purchase the film from the Nehru or Krishan Khera, Toronto's
representative to the South Asia Microform Project (SAMP), could have
the title be purchased by SAMP as a discretionary acquisition.
