Dharani & Mantra Pitaka
Dear Colleagues:
I have a friend that looks for some edition of two texts from the
Mahasanghika School of buddhism.
These texts are the "Dharani" and the "Mantra Pitaka".
I have not any other references about them.
If somebody knows anything please, send e-mail to me to
flavio.mainero at hastinapura.ax.apc.org
Thank you.
