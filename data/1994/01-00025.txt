Recently I attended a conference where a paper on Vrtra was delivered.
The author postulates that Vrtra was an earthen bund formed as a
result of tectonic shifting in the Indus region. The proposition
satisfies many of the Rgvedic epithets of Vrtra.
Does anyone has info. about such a hypothesis put forward in any
literature?
