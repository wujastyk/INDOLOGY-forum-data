In response to Andrew Fort's query:

        I disclaim knowledge of whether it is reliable or not, and I only
skimmed it quickly at breakfast, but the issue of the AAR (American Academy
of Religion) Journal which arrived yesterday has an article (forgive me but
I do not recall the authors name, or the exact title) on the roots of the
VHP ideology, with some very interesting stuff of aggressive and militant
ascetics.  My copy is at home, so I cannot be more specific.  Perhaps
someone has the journal at hand?
