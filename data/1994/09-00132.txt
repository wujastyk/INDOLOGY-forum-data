Qualifications for entering into a debate
Dear Prof. Dr. Frank (and I use the term advisedly) Conlon:
Just where do you get off telling me and my colleagues to have a "nice" 
day?  While I readily admit to not being privy (and I use *that* term 
advisedly) to the latest in hip west coast greetings, nevertheless I 
deconstruct more than a little sarcasm in that remark, and I find it 
profligate, even wasteful, since just a little sarcasm would have done 
very nicely.
I am not familiar with the scholars you refer to in your typical 
insider's manner, "the Simpsons", and I don't even want to know what 
perverse politics may have given rise to the wildly inappropriate reference 
to "having" cows.  I willsimply close by confessing, reluctantly, that the 
tone of your letter has moved me to this--
YOU have a nice day.
Richard
PS.  Best to Joan.
