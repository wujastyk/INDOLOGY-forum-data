translation of Les quatre sens de la vie
Dileep Karanth just said: 
Here is the information on the French text.  I don't know of an 
English version, but I will check the French book to see if it 
mentions one.  I will send you a direct email about that on Friday, 
which is the soonest I can inspect the book.
