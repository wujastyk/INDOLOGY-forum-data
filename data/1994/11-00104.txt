Mahaabhaarata and Raamaayana
Good Day to you all,
Alternate transcriptions of the Mahabharata and Ramayana for
use with CSX or HACCIndic viewers are now available at
  blackbox.hacc.washington.edu in directory pub/indic/Tokunaga
The files are stored in zip archives, to be ftp'ed in binary
mode and then unzipped on your end.
The new files are:
-rw-r--r--  1 ridgeway 4014436 Nov 16 17:11 mb_csx.zip  mahabharat for CSX
-rw-r--r--  1 ridgeway 4014436 Nov 16 17:12 mb_win.zip  mahabharat for Windows
-rw-r--r--  1 ridgeway 1049576 Nov 16 17:12 ram_csx.zip ramayana for CSX
-rw-r--r--  1 ridgeway 1049576 Nov 16 17:13 ram_win.zip ramayana for Windows
'for Windows' means use with the HACCIndic character set.
  The files will unzip to nearly three times the sizes indicated above for
the zipped format.
cheers,
Tom
