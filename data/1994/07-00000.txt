A few days ago I asked about "Altar of Fire."
Thanks to those who gave advice.  In the end,
thanks to the kindness of the staff of the
Association for Asian Studies I got the details,
and thought I would share it for the information
of all.
The film / video is available from University of
California Extension / center for Media and
Independent Learning / 2000 Center Street, Fourth Floor /
Berkeley CA  94704.  Phone (510) 642-0460, fax
(510) 643-8683.  The film is listed in their 1993-1994
catalogue as #37360, for sale in 16mm film for $900
(this is NOT a misprint!!), video $295, or rental
for $55 (one day's use!).  (One can watch "Return of
the Jedi" a considerable number of times for that amount.)
Anyway, I don't suppose Prof. Staal profits much from this,
but somebody does, I assume.
