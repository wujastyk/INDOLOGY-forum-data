Dear Prof. Deshpande,
Thanks, I will post the typed in version on the net. Although I was
familiar with the lyrics for quite sometime, I never knew the meaning
of most of the words. Your translation was very revealing and I
enjoyed reading it very much. It never ceases to amaze me how much
meaning can be packed into so few syllables of Sanskrit!
Here is the posting with the header, once again.
thanks,
