clogged up as much as it has in the past by responses to 
messages of this type, which many of us feel would be better 
posted somewhere else. 
	However, you do ask one question of "indological" interest. I've 
no idea what is meant by an "ascetic dynasty", but numismatic evidence 
and Vayupurana (99.383) do suggest Mathura was held by a succession 
of rulers who styled themselves "Naga", with names such as Ganapatinaga
and Sharvanaga, who became feudatories of the Guptas. I'm also not sure 
what is meant by "Buddhist Kushans" - The last Kushana to rule at Mathura 
was named Vasudeva.
