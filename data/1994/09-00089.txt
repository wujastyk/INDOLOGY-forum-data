In answer to the request by Lars Martin Fosse for references to translations
of Tamil works, we include a brief list below. It is intended to give a 
cross-section of the work done in this century. It must be noted that many of
these works were unavailable to most scholars until the beginning of this
century, when most of them were edited by U. V. Swaminathaiyar. 

Since many texts refer to poetic conventions which have no equivalent 
in other literatures, we have included also a few studies and articles 
which may help the newcomer to Tamil Studies. One should also note 
that many works translate not the text itself, but a paraphrase 
by famous mediaeval commentators. 
These commentaries were written because a direct understanding of the text had 
become difficult in their time. It follows that these commentaries 
represent a deformation of the original to some extent. It is therefore 
recommended to look at the texts themselves whenever possible, 
or at least to compare several translations.   
                           
To my earlier comments on the place of Tamil sources in Indology,
one may add two further points:

 1) We now know that there were direct contacts between Rome and
Greece and the ancient Tamils, by sea, before the Christian Era; see e.g.

    J. Andre and J. Filliozat, L'Inde vue de Rome : textes latins de
    l'antiquite, relatifs a l'Inde, Paris, Belles Lettres, 1986. 

 2) It is also known that Tamil colons played a major role in the 
spreading of Indian culture in South-East Asia, from the time of the 
Pallavas (see the references below).


The following list is limited to studies in Western languages. Those with some
knowledge of modern Tamil are *strongly* urged to look up U. V. Swaminathaiyar's
editions (for PuRam, Kampan, PattuppAt't'u, KuRuntokai...) which combine modern
standards of scholarship with an excellent understanding of the texts. 
It would, by the way, be very nice if these editions were reedited---
I would appreciate knowing of any effort in this direction.
For KuRaL, the Tiruppan_antAL edition, which includes five (sometimes 
contradictory) commentaries, is recommended.

I also think that there is an English rendering of PukazhEnti's
NaLa-veNpA by M. Langton.


In answer to S. Nadesan's question, very little is available in electronic 
format. 
Many texts of the Sangam, as well as the definitions in the Madras Tamil
Lexicon, are available online by Gopher, from linus.informatik.uni-koeln.de 
(vt100-type terminal emulation is fine, and the transliteration system
is explained in separate files).
The texts themselves are however in Tamil only.


I'd be happy to provide further pointers if needed---this list is not meant
to be exhaustive.
