I have forwarded directly to Jonathan Silk a copy of the list of South 
Asian language programs that we maintain as part of the ILM (Inventory of 
Language Materials) on our South Asia Gopher.  I can forward it to others 
if needed, or anyone can find it through the Gopher.  This list is more 
complete than the one Steve Poulos had posted, and I've now incorporated 
his updates into it.  All further input welcome, as with the Fonts list 
and the other materials lists.
With good wishes to everyone for the holidays,
