	Good morning!
	Two questions please: Are there any devanagari and tamil fonts
	on the market (for PC)? If yes, may I have addresses, phone numbers,
	faxes, e-mails and prices?
	And old sanskrit texts? Do already exist e.g. mahabharatam, ramayanam,
	vedas, upanishads, kathasaritsagaram etc. etc. on diskettes or CD's?
	Thank you very much for your kind help, I really appreciate it very
	much.
	Very faithfully,
