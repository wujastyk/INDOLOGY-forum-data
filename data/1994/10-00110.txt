The laryngeal theory
One may offer some clarification concerning Reusch's second point.  It is 
more accurate to say that it is the Paninian tradition as enshrined in 
the different versions of the Paniniya Siksa which regards aspiration, 
voicing and nasality as produced by baahya-prayatna or external efforts.  
Panini's own view can be only indirectly inferred.  These features are 
indeed phonemic in modern terms and cause a difference between Varnas 
even in the ancient Indian phonetic systems.  Within the Paninian system, 
the term baahya-prayatna simply means that these features do not prevent 
two sounds from becoming savarNas or homogeneous class-members as defined 
by P.1.1.9 (tulyaasyaprayatnam savarNam).  Beyond this limited purpose, 
there is nothing 'external' signified by the term baahya.
