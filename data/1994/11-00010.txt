VHP and United Way
In reply to Rajender Razdan's message:
As a Hindu who dislikes the VHP (whether "I" or "A"),
I find it funny that VHP-walas refer to us as "Westernized"
and "alienated."  On the contrary, the VHP-walas are the 
ones who are infected by the Islamic/Christian tendency 
to mix politics and religion.  
I wish they would recover from this Islamization and return 
to being normal, non-political, traditional Hindus.
Let Hinduism be your religion, not your profession.
Regards,
Narayan Sriranga Raja.
