Tamil dictionary dispute III
On Aug 11, 1994, D. Wujastyk published on this discussion list allegations
of plagiarism and copyright infringement in connection with the Tamil
lexicographical work done at our institute without substantiating them in
any way whatsoever. I have been waiting for him to publish a substantiation
of these allegations, but so far have not seen any on the indology list. I
would therefore like to ask Mr Wujastyk to explain his procedure.
