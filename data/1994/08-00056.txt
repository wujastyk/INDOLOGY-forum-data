Hi everyone,
 
I have developed a LEAST EXPENSIVE HINDI FONT for IBM PC or compatible
computer or Macintosh computer. Compared to the cost of a HINDI Font 
available in the market ranging from $100 to $300 and more, this 
font is available at only $25. This is done to promote Hindi
specially for Indian children living abroad and computer is a great tool for
that purpose.
"HINDI VERNMALA" as I have given the name of my font, is a scaleable, TRUE TYPE
 font (TTF) i.e.  it can be changed to any size. Other attributes such as 
italics, bold,underline, shadow, outline, superscript, subscript etc. can be applied
to it. It can be used with any application (word processing, spreadsheet,
Drawing or graphing programs etc.)  that is supported under MICROSOFT
WINDOWS 3.1 or higher. All necessary characters including conjuncts 
required for normal Hindi Text are included.It can display on screen and print on any supported 
printer, all characters in any sizes. PostScript Type1 , PostScript Type3,
EPS (Encapsulated PostScript), or Bitmapped font can also be generated.
Bitmapped font can only be provided for only one size specified by the user.
Mention detail if you need other than TRUE TYPE FONT.
"Hindi VERNMALA" font is also available for MACINTOSH COMPUTER.
Hindi Characters are phonetically entered (as they sound).
