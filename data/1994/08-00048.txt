Fonts & Sanskrit courses
Dear fellow listers,
Can anyone help me to find a MacIntosh-compatible roman-alphabet font that 
has the necessary diacritical marks to write Sankskrit and Pali? Also, can
anyone recommend a Sanskrit/Pali-alphabet font for the Mac?
I am interested in learning Sanskrit via computer. Is that possible? If 
not, which books/learning programs can anyone recommend?
Thanks in advance for any help you might be able to render. 
Sincerely,
Greg Eichler

Try Linguist's Software, P.O. Box 580, Edmonds, WA  98020.  Phone 
(206) 775-1130.  They offer (or at least used to offer) ATM compatible 
PostScript and Truetype fonts compatible with all basic Mac software 
programs.  I believe they have roman alphabet fonts with all appropriate 
diacritics (both serif and sans serif) as well as Devanagari.
