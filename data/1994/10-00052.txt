Subject: Clarification of my intent re: yogaacaara
Message-ID: <161227017556.23782.8332975477307069047.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

      Regarding my recent posting concerning Questions on Classical
Indology:    In item 2, I am looking for uses of yogaacaara in non-Buddhist
Sanskrit materials OTHER THAN in its meaning of a Buddhist philosophical
school.
        Sorry for the confusion.
