Clarification of my intent re: yogaacaara
      Regarding my recent posting concerning Questions on Classical
Indology:    In item 2, I am looking for uses of yogaacaara in non-Buddhist
Sanskrit materials OTHER THAN in its meaning of a Buddhist philosophical
school.
        Sorry for the confusion.
