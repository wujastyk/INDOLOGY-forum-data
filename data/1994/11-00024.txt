Once before I pleaded that we keep this list strictly scholarly. 
The current renewed spate of political controversy prompts me to  
take a vacation from this network. May I make the following requests:

(1) would this list's manager kindly unsubscribe me for the time being?

(2) would those who wish any items of scholarly discussion to come to 
my attention please address their messages directly to me?

... but Rosane, this statement in itself is so unscholarly, and oh so 
political !
