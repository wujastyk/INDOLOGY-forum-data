Other UMI databases
        University Microfilms Inc (UMI) Database
        ----------------------------------------
As Dr. D. Keown has written, UMI database can be searched
for any dissertation on Religion, Theology and Philosophy.
The gopher address is gopher://gopher.umi.com
But is there a way to search the UMI database on doctoral dissertations
on other subjects of indological interest like art, architecture, 
language, literature, history, ethonology, arts and crafts, performing arts, 
etc.,
Any pointers??
