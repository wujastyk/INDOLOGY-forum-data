Past habitual in Tulu and Tibetan
For a dissertation dealing, in part, with the use of a single form for past
habitual and contrafactive statements in the South Asian linguistic area, I'm
looking for information on the grammatical forms used for past habitual
statements (for example, the English statement, 'I used to study Sanskrit') in
Tibetan and Tulu. Any help members of this list could provide would be
appreciated.
