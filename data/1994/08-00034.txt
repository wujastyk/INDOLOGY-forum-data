  I believe what we mean is that Find/Replace doesn't show the
right characters as you type them in in the find dialog box?  It should
acutally go on and conduct the search if you type in the right codes.

I've taken a look at this; one can change the system font so as to get a 
font with the indic chars as the system font, but most applications do not 
use the system font in dialogue boxes, but rather use something like MS Sans.
You would expect to find the same situation in Ami, you will definitely
find the same situation in WPWin.  One could make up a new font and 
have it masquerade as MS Sans, but I don't know whether this would
work out well.

N.B.  blackbox.hacc.washington.edu in pub/indic/outlines now has some
software to facilitate typing in romanized indic in any (well, most any) 
windows program.  It is based on the freeware 'Compose' keyboard remapper.
Some documentation is also included.  See the UPDATES file for details.

cheers,
Tom
