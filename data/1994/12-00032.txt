Call for papers

GENDER,CULTURE AND SOCIETY.
  Indian Book Centre. New Delhi.
Contributions are invited for this new journal to be launched in 1995.
The boundaries of feminism have implications for culture and society, its 
praxis, paradigms of thought and institutional complexities.  The 
construction of identity concerning women in non- metropolitan countries 
are fraught with any number of epistemological difficulties.  There are 
complexities of class, subjectivity,and historical cultural development.  
How these experiences structure the everyday reality of women's lives can 
be understood from a number of perspectives,  
vis. anthropology, psychoanalysis, philosophy, critism, post-colonial 
discourse, and subaltern studies.

The journal hopes to provide a meeting space for scholars, writers and 
students of all theoretical persuations to dialouge and discuss new ideas 
in interdisciplinary scope.  One issue per year will be published.  
Longer works of 40,000 words plus will be considered for publication in a 
companion series. (Naari: Series in Gender Studies.)

Contributions are to be submitted on Mac or Dos? IBM disc; innovative and 
to a maximum of 5000 words.  Deadline for first issue papers is 31st
