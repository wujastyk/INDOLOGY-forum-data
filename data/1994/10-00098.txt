Origin and symbology of "Monsoon rain"
American Heritage Dictionary lists monsoon as deriving from the
obsolete Dutch word monssoen, from the Portuguese mon,c~ao, from the
Arabic mausim. My PLATTS Urdu, Classical Hindi and English Dictionary
(never far from my side) also shows the Urdu word mausim deriving from
Arabic mausim (time, season), from the root wasama ('brand,
describe'). Apparently, Persian does not use this word for the meaning
of time or season.

Haim's Shorter Persian-English Dictionary (Tehran, 1982) lists "mausim" (A.),
meaning "Season. Time." However, another Arabic loan word, "fasl,"
may be more common (in Persian) for "season."
