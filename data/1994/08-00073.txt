Actually David is reachable indirectly by email, through his research 
student and assistant Kim Plofker (who is actually in India right now,
I think).  E-Address: hmath at brownvm.brown.edu

But it would still be better to read David's books than to bother him
with email.

You should also look at vol. VI of _The Cultural Heritage of India_, ed. 
Priyadranjan Ray (Calcutta: Ramakrishna Mission, 1986, reprint 1991) which 
contains a number of useful essays on various aspects of the history of 
science in India.
