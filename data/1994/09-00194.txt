The Asia Society sponsored a study mission to South Asia that visited the 
region from March 22 - April 8, 1994 and which has just published its 
report. The study mission, which consisted of thirteen prominent 
Americans, analyzed U.S. policies toward South Asia, sought South Asian 
views on those policies, and formulated an assessment of the adequacy of 
those policies and changes which may be needed. This symposium's primary 
purpose is to bring the results of the study mission and sponses to the 
study mission report from South Asian participants to a broad public in 
order to encourage wider debate about the American relationship with 
South Asia.
