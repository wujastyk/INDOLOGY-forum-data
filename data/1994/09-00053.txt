On 6 Sep 94, there was the following inquiry by Dr. J.B. Bapat:
"I am looking for articles, books, references etc. on court society,
descriptions of courts, palaces. spatial organization, from Mogul, 
Rajput, Maratha and Vijaynagar periods. Could someone help?"

Edwards, Michael. 1969. Indian Temples and Palaces. London, New York,
Sydney, Toronto: Paul Hamlyn.Great Buildings of the World series. Has a
short bibilography for further reading at the end. 
Nakagawa, Tsuyoshi.1973.  India. Bombay etc: Allied Publishers. Vol. 39 in
This Beautiful World series. Has a chapter on sultans and rajahs. 
Gutman, Judith Mara. 1982. Through Indian Eyes.  New York: Oxford Univ.
Press. Intl' Centre of Photography. Many pictures of court life.
