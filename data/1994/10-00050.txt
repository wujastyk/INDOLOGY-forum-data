PALI JATAKAS PLEASE
Help please!!!
I am in an urgent need of an electronical version of at least some of the 
buddhist j-atakas in pali. I am not able to create it myself in time.
Any help or info is greatly appreciated. Even if someone is only working on it
and would agree to share with me what is already done, I would be grateful.
Thanks in advance
