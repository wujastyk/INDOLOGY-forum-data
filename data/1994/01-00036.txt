Hello, regarding the manuscripts you mention  I believe they are all quite
obscure and a quick check indicates that none of these works or their
authors are in the Nagari Pracarini Sabha survey of Hindi manuscripts.
However, I have a comment regarding the work called Koka-bhusana by Josi
Jagananatha in the second manuscript.  The Wellcome collection contains a
copy of a medical work by an author of the same name which was copied in AD
1747.  As the subject of Koka might also have been a topic written on by an
author of a medical work it is possible they are by the same author.  I can
find no references to this author anywhere apart from in our manuscript.
