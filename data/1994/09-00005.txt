Khandhaka of the Vinayapitaka
A student of our institute is going to write his thesis about the Khandaka
of the Vinayapitaka. He would like to know if this text (or for that
matter: the whole vinayapitaka) is available in electronic format, and
where the text can be obtained.
Please send answers to my email account.
