Subject: SRI CAKRA-SRI VIDYA AGAIN

          Re:  Construction of the Sricakra 
           
          Library of Congress has a pamphlet, not yet cataloged, apparently 
          concerning the coordination of the triangles in the Sricakra with 
          the bijas in the mantra.  If it deals also with how the yantra is 
          erected geometrically it has no diagrams.  The work is: 
           
          Caturvedi, Candrasekhara. 
          Tantrika varga se nirnaya ki manga : Sri Vidya mantra ka visuddha 
          svarupa 
          Mathura : Rajesvari Presa, 4 p. 
          In Hindi. 
           
          If anyone is interested I would be glad to send a free photocopy, 
          since it is so short.
