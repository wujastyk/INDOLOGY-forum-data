Subject: text of Mahishasuramardinistotra and an initial translation
Message-ID: <161227016858.23782.6920046264568181379.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I am forwarding to Indology a romanized text of the Mahishasuramardini
stotra.  The romanization is done by Mr. Ramkumar of Stanford.  It does
not follow the CSX or any of the academic mode of transliteration, and yet
is useful.  I have added to it an initial translation of my own.  In 
several places, I am not certain of the text or of its meaning.  Please
feel free to make suggestions for improvements.
