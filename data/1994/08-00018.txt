Astadhyayi.zip -- what is it and how to read?
I would like your help in the following: I have downloaded the  
astadhyayi.zip file from ftp.bcc.ac.uk. Inside there is one TeX file,  
stating to be Panini's Sutrapatha. I have tried to TeX it, but there  
were strange results. The text contained letters like T,C,K,  
French-like accents, and other unknown characters, e.g. two short  
horizontal parallel lines. I am beginner with Sanskrit, but this text  
seems to be corrupted. So could you tell me:
1. What is Sutrapatha? I know only Astadhyayi from Panini. And why are  
the names different outside and inside?
2. How can I reproduce the text? Do I need some special font or utility  
to replace uppercase characters and other strange effects?
