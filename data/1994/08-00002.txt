I would check the OCLC catalog and request a copy through interlibrary loan
from Harvard, Berkeley, Chicago (the university or the research libraries
center), Madison, Seattle, etc.

Hello Mr. Samuels, did you try Interlibrary loan through your local
University?

Please try Interlibrary loan through your University library.
Also South Asia Books, Columbus, Missouri may have a copy.
Of course, Motilal Banarsidass in Delhi will for sure carry
one of the standard editions from Chowkhamba in Benares.

Dear Colleagues,
I am trying to find a means of writing diacritics for Sanskrit
transcription using Microsoft Word for Windows on a PC.
Has anybody any suggestions? Or can somebody point me to where
I can look?
Specifically I need to be able to write:
  = a dot under 'n', 'm', 'h', 'th', and 's'
  = a circle under 'r' (or a dot will do)
  = matra over vowels (and 'r')
  = acute accent over 's'
Any help appreciated. Thanks in advance.
Edeltraud (eclear at bronze.ucs.indiana.edu)
