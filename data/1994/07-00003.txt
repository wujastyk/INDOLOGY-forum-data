2. ABOUT THE JOURNAL
 
AIMS
 
The Journal of Buddhist Ethics has been established to promote the
study of Buddhist ethics through the publication of research
papers, discussion articles, bulletins, and reviews.
 
DESCRIPTION
 
The Journal of Buddhist Ethics is the first academic journal
dedicated entirely to Buddhist ethics, and is innovative in
adopting a totally electronic mode of publication. In most other
respects, however, it will function as a traditional scholarly
journal. Research papers and discussion articles submitted to the
journal will be subject to blind peer review.
 
THE CONCEPT OF AN ON-LINE JOURNAL
An on-line journal differs from a traditional journal in publishing
electronically as opposed to a printed format. The Journal of
Buddhist Ethics will also publish material on an on-going rather
than a periodic basis, eliminating any backlog between acceptance
and publication. An on-line journal is NOT the same as a newsgroup,
discussion list, or bulletin board.

WHY PUBLISH ON-LINE?
 
On-line journals are a logical development in the use of
information technology. The dissemination of information through
this medium has three main advantages over publication in the
traditional manner, namely, cost, speed, and ease of access. Other
advantages of an electronic medium include keyword searching and
the use of multimedia and hypertext formats.
 
EDITORIAL POLICY
 
The Editors are committed to the widest dissemination for research
published by the journal. As well as publishing on-line they will
also explore possibilities for the publication of selected material
in partnership with traditional presses.
 
CITATION INDEXES
 
The journal will be searched by the usual citation indexes for this
subject classification.
 
3. SUBJECT CLASSIFICATIONS
 
The Journal of Buddhist Ethics interprets "ethics" as including
subject matter in the ten areas listed below.

4. GLOBAL RESOURCE CENTER
 
In conjunction with the journal an on-line Global Resource Center
has been established with the aim of providing research tools for
scholarship in the field of Buddhist ethics. Projects currently
planned include a bibliography of publications in Buddhist ethics
and a register of research in progress. Further possibilities
include an electronic archive of relevant periodical literature,
and the production of teaching materials for use in undergraduate
courses. At present the Center provides World Wide Web links to a
wide range of electronic resources in Buddhism. It can be accessed
by following the instructions under "World Wide Web Browsers" in
the section entitled "How the Journal Works".
