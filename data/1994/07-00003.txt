2. ABOUT THE JOURNAL
AIMS
The Journal of Buddhist Ethics has been established to promote the
study of Buddhist ethics through the publication of research
papers, discussion articles, bulletins, and reviews.
DESCRIPTION
The Journal of Buddhist Ethics is the first academic journal
dedicated entirely to Buddhist ethics, and is innovative in
adopting a totally electronic mode of publication. In most other
respects, however, it will function as a traditional scholarly
journal. Research papers and discussion articles submitted to the
journal will be subject to blind peer review.
THE CONCEPT OF AN ON-LINE JOURNAL
An on-line journal differs from a traditional journal in publishing
electronically as opposed to a printed format. The Journal of
Buddhist Ethics will also publish material on an on-going rather
than a periodic basis, eliminating any backlog between acceptance
and publication. An on-line journal is NOT the same as a newsgroup,
discussion list, or bulletin board.
WHY PUBLISH ON-LINE?
On-line journals are a logical development in the use of
information technology. The dissemination of information through
this medium has three main advantages over publication in the
traditional manner, namely, cost, speed, and ease of access. Other
advantages of an electronic medium include keyword searching and
the use of multimedia and hypertext formats.
EDITORIAL POLICY
The Editors are committed to the widest dissemination for research
published by the journal. As well as publishing on-line they will
also explore possibilities for the publication of selected material
in partnership with traditional presses.
CITATION INDEXES
The journal will be searched by the usual citation indexes for this
subject classification.
