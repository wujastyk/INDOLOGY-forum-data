Ayurvedic medicine
A graduate student in Sociology at the University of Pennsylvania 
is beginning work on a doctoral dissertation about the practice of 
Ayurvedic medicine in North America.  I first thought of introducing 
her electronically to Mitchell Weiss (hi, Mitch!) and Kenneth Zysk
(whose direct electronic address I mislaid, sorry, Ken), but, on 
further reflection, I thought that some other people interested in 
the same subject might wish also to get in touch with her. 
Her name is  Sita Reddy, 
her electronic address is  sreddy0 at sas.upenn.edu. 
Happy Thanksgiving!
