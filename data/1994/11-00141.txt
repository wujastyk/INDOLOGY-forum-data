H-ASIA: Inspired revisionism-Hist. of India (LONG) (fwd)
Dear Colleagues:
A fellow-scholar here suggested that it would be appropriate to forward 
this H-ASIA posting to Indology.  I apologize for its length, but I did 
not want to mischaracterize the editorial views of Hinduism Today in my 
posting.
