that the macros can be run on dos WP5.1 also, as they are created by
combining WP special characters and diacritics, which you can do on dos
also, although I couldn't tell you how.  However--I believe that you have
to have Adobe Type Manager (which comes with WP5.2 for Windows) or a True
Type font in order for the transliteration to be printed out.  I could ask
people who still use dos for more advice if you wish.
