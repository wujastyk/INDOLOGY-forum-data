Only to Deleep
PLEASE SEND ME A COPY OF THAT BOOK. IF IT IS TOO LONG, PLEASE, DIVIDE IT
INTO PARTS, SEND ME SOME AND AFTER I GET IT I WILL REQUEST THE REST. (THIS
IS BECAUSE I HAVE SOME DISK QUOTA HERE)
P.S.
I had sent this to deleep at math.utexas, but it returned to me as with "host
unknown". Please, next time write your personal address at the end of such
messages so that the requests could be sent only to you. It is very annoying
to have ones mailbox full of replies with long message copied and "please
send me a copy too" added.
