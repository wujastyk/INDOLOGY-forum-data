Summer language
Very recently a list of summer language programs was posted, if I recall
rightly here on INDOLOGY.  I regret that I deleted this list, because today
I student asked me about summer programs in Tibetan.  Can someone be so
kind as to send me the reference for that list, or if you still have it
sitting in your computer just forward a copy to me, please?  I would
appreciate it very much.
