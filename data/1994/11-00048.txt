VHP and United Way (fwd)
Yes indeed, I am advocating finding the balance between
intellectual honesty and self-awareness, and tedious
innappropriate soap-box ranting, which I never read any way
, surely have no place on lists such as these. But one
can err in either direction. For the time being, I use
the delete command when confronted with these soap-box
rantings, but one has to seek a balance, not an elimination
of *all* political materials. 
Is it possible to achieve that? I reckon Richard Hayes is 
along the right lines in advocating moderation.
