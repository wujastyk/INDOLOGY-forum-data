Merry, the above URL seems to be incorrect. I assume the serve should
be "cheops.anu.edu.au" rather than the form without 'au' that you
listed. But also, the directory listing you gave in the rest of the URL
is wrong (even if one writes Coombs-db instead of Cooms-db). Could you
repost this with the right form of the URL so we can get at it?
(Particularly looking for the asian fonts info you mentioned, in the
"Asian computing database").  Many thanks.   David
