In response to Allen Thrasher's post about the ITES edition, 
here is a recent history of Thirumoolar's Thirumandiram. 
Information partly from the foreword to the 1993 edition and 
partly from David Creighton, who did the layout for the 1993 
edition. 
 
1979:     Madras, ITES.  Projected 10 volumes, Tamil and 
          English.  Only one volume was printed before the 
          effort foundered.  This must be the single volume 
          that the LoC has. 
 
1991:     Madras (Mylapore, Madras 600 004), Sri Ramakrishna 
          Math.  Complete in one volume, Tamil and English. 
 
1993:     Montreal, Babaji's Kriya Yoga and Publications, 
          165 de la Gauchetiere ouest, Montreal, PQ, 
          Canada, tel. (514) 284-3551.  English only, 
          three volumes, with new introduction, index, 
          glossary, and illus. 
 
All three use the English translation of Dr B. Natarajan, but I 
am told that it has been revised somewhat from edition to edition. 
I have only seen the 1993 edition so I can't say how much 
difference there is. 
 
*Both* the 1991 and 1993 editions are available from Babaji's 
in Montreal, address above. 
 
Thanks to Allen Thrasher for finding the English of the 
Danielou book.
