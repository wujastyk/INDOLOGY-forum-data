The best laser devanagari font I've seen for the Mac is called Jaipur and was 
developed at University of British Columbia, and I understand that it may be 
obtained through Dr. Ashok Aklujkar. It's easy to use, and has all the major 
letter combinations. Another font (bitmap) was developed by John Roberts at 
U. of Virginia. It's not as elegant as Jaipur, but it has some useful 
combinations if one is doing Hindi.
