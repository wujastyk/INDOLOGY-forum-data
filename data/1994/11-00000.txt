Sorry.  The United Way is a large and respected organization that 
collects money and distributes it to charities, many of them also highly 
respected.  The yearly United Way campaign is an established part of 
American civic life.  At my university, for example, the United Way 
campaign is officially sponsored, the president appoints a campaign 
chair, and all employees are urged to donate.  Hence, to be accepted as 
an official charity of the United Way is a considerable boon to any cause.
