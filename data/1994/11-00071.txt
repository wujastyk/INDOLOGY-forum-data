Conference on Religion in South India
Paul, I just reviewed your message on the Conference on Religion in South India 
and realized I had not responded. Although I am still uncertain whether I could 
attend this year (hope to be in India), I would very much like to be placed on 
your distribution list. By the way, since you don't know me, I teach Asian 
Religions and Western Civilization at Rhodes College in Memphis Tennessee (my 
degree is in Buddhist studies, specializing in Indian Mahayana from U of 
Michigan). Thanks.
Richard S. Cohen
