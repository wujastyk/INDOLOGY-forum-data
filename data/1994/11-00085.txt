  to which I say Shabash!

For the slight benefit of the universe in the form of bandwidth 
conservation, I have made the files available on the ftp host 
    blackbox.hacc.washington.edu in the directory
    pub/indic/Tokunaga
Blackbox is in the United States, in Washington State; it will be easier
on the network if people on this continent obtain copies locally.  Please
note that blackbox is a Unix machine, and does care a great deal
about that capital T in Tokunaga.

I will add a list of all files after my signature.

In addition to the original files, which are btw in Unix Compress format,
I have added initial restranscriptions of the first sections of each
book in the CSX and Indic-ANSI for windows character sets.  I invite
interested parties to examine these retranscriptions and inform me of
any shortcomings they might observe.  Before retranscribing the
entire mahabharata (so to speak) I would like to think I am doing it
right.  These files are in plain (8-bit) text without compression.


Nota Bene: I will no longer be with the University of Washington after 
November 30.  It is very likely that this text archive will no longer be 
maintained after my departure so anyone with interest in these holdings
would do well to obtain copies before that time.  I would hope to complete
this little project before then.

cheers,
Tom
