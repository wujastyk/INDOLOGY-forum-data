	Call for Papers: 24th Annual Conference on South Asia, Madison, WI
	==================================================================
				November 1995
				-------------
	Every year, usually during the first weekend in November, the
Center for South Asia [CSA], University of Wisconsin, Madison holds a
conference on South Asia in Madison, WI. It is a very very eclectic
conference with a wide range of issues and viewpoints represented. 
	The scholarly and academic community has a vital role to play in
the understanding of the issues involved in the gay/lesbian experience of
South Asians -- both in the diaspora in North America and in South Asia
itself.  The addition of the issues that sexuality-minorities deal with,
into the corpus of knowledge about cultures increases awareness on all
sides of the issues. 
	To help expand the knowledge base on this broad topic, I will be
organizing the following two INTERDISCIPLINARY PANELS for the 1995
Conference on South Asia.  I invite you to explore the possibility of
presenting a scholarly paper in either panel under the framework outlined
below. 
PANEL I:  SPACE AND SEXUALITY IN SOUTH ASIA: TOWARDS A NEW ORDERING OF SPACE.
Themes:  
	As gay/lesbian and other sexuality minorities gradually become
more and more visible on the cultural landscapes of South Asia, several
issues arise regarding the sharing of space among majorities who have
traditionally been visible and minorities who are only now slowly becoming
visible. 
Some topics:
1.  What are the dynamics involved in the emergent gay/lesbian landscapes
in the overall cultural milieu of South Asian cultural space? 
2.  What are the landscapes of hope, of fear, of ignorance, and of
enlightenment that are emerging in that region? 
3.  What is the nature of the interactions among gays/lesbians in the
South Asian cultural space? 
4.  What does the future hold for this minority whose identity is still
nascent? 
	PANEL II:  TOWARDS A SENSE OF BELONGING: THE GAY/LESBIAN SOUTH ASIAN 
	--------   ---------------------------------------------------------
				DIASPORA IN NORTH AMERICA
				-------------------------
Theme:
	When South Asian gays and lesbians come to North America, they
face a very unique set of challenges.  In a nutshell, it is learning the
art and science of balancing many disparate elements of their inner
identities with those of the new identities they strive to craft in order
to acculturate for success in a relatively more 'open' society where they
are minorities in many more ways.  The cultural make-up of being South
Asian, of belonging to this or that religion from the region, being a
person of color in North American society, trying to come out in this
milieu which understands so little about the South Asian culture -- such
are the challenges facing the gays and lesbians of the South Asian
diaspora in North America. 
Some topics:
1.  Facing discrimination on multiple fronts.
2.  How can the gay/lesbian diaspora craft an identity in this milieu in 
	a nourishing way?  What are the challenges involved in this?
3.  What are the nature and status of the organized gay/lesbian movements 
	in the South Asian diaspora?
4.  What are the issues of identity involved individually and as a group?
==============================================================================
FORMAT OF PANELS:
1.  Minimum 3 papers; max. 4 papers.
2.  Each presenter will have 20 min. [15 min. presentation + 5 min. Q & A]

which journal will be most appropriate for us to consider.  The journal
