Aryans and Dravidians
	Well taken points!
| 
| The reader who wishes to see for him/herself may want to learn 
| more about the following works
	Yes! 
| 
| * For philosophical literature:
|      Tirumantiram (by TirumUlar): one of the earliest treatises of
| Saiva Siddhanta
	As you no doubt are aware, legend has it that Tirumular was a
	Sanskrit speaking sage from the Himalayas who traveled to Tamil
	Nadu on the instructions of his Guru to revive Savia
	Siddhanta.  In order to do so, he left his body and inhabited
	the body of a cowherd (mular) who had just passed away .. this
	so he could gain instant knowledge of Tamil.   He then
	supposedly brought forth his realizations in the local tongue.
	Whether or not the story has any merit, its a profound
	mystical treatise, much closer in nature to Agamic than
	to Vedic works.
	Question: where is this important work available in English?
	In particular, is there an electronic copy you know of?  The
	same question applies to the other works you have mentioned,
	and also to the Saiva Agamas.
| 
| * For poetry:
|      PuRanAnURu, AkanAnURu: two of the oldest anthologies.
|      TirukkuRaL: arguably the most famous work in Tamil
| 
	Indeed, as it is sworn upon in the courts of Tamil Nadu and its
	perfect poetry has been compared to Shakespeare.  It has been
	translated many times, but a modern English translation hasn't
	been done.  One is now being completed and is scheduled for
	publication in 1995 in conjunction with the installation
	ceremonies for the stupendous Tiruvalluvar statue that Sri
	Ganapathi Stapathi is carving for the island at Cape Comorin,
	at the southernmost tip of India.
