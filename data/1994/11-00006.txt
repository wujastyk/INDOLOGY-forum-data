I agree with the sentiments of Vinod. I think it was inappropriate to post 
anything, pro or con about VHP on this list just because it has "indo" in 
its name. The post in question was already posted to several newgroups, 
including pakistani and muslim groups and it was waste of resources of 
this list and against its agenda.
