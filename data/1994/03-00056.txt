I would be happy to receive a copy of your text. At the same time, I can
offer you copies of my own transliterated texts (I do not vouch for their
quality as far as typographical errors are concerned). Among the texts I
can offer you are the fables from the Tantrakhyayika (also available from
the Liverpool listserver, I believe), parts of the dashakumaracarita, the
kathasaritsagara (the Nala), kumarasambhava (first 4 books with compounds
separated) as well as others.

Best regards,

Lars Martin Fosse
