UniVerse
 Question: experience and impressions of users of UniVerse Software
 --------- for Oriental languages
 May we ask experienced users of UniVerse /Gamma Productions/ working
 with its Hindi/Sanskrit modules for a short review of this programme
 or just a recommendation/warning to its potential buyers?
 						Thanks.
