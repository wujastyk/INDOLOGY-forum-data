Vastusastra
to Jim Hartzell's question:
One of the best source materials is Varaahamihira's 
BRhatsamhitaa Chapter 52 'Vaastuvidyaa-adhyaaya' (in 
Srasvatii Bhavan Granthamaalaa Vol.97) of which several
English translations are available.  I have digitalized
the whole text of the BRhatsamhitaa and it is already on
the net.  Recently we have placed the updated version of
the e-text at the following ftp site.
