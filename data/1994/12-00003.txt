Out of curiosity, is it at all possible to place the new e-versions of 
the Indian epics on the World Wide Web?  Is there a copyright procedure 
that would be involved?

Also, I was wondering if anyone would be able to help me find a statistic 
that I have been searching for for about 6 months.  I am trying to learn 
the caste(s) (jati/varna) of the students sent to England in the first two 
decades of the twentieth century by the State of Mysore (prior to the 
establishment of the University of Mysore).  I'm guessing 
that a vast majority of them were Brahmins...?
