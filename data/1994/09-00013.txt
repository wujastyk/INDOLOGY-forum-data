Namaste:
Recently a question was posted here about astrology.  I sent it
to a dear friend, Dr. Devananda Tandavan, who is a member of the
American Federation of Astrologers.  I am simply passing this on
for your interest sake, please don't ask me any questions about it,
I'm no Vedic astrologer; he is.  However, I will pass on any messages,
elucidations, etc.

Om Sivaya, Dear Sadhu!
This is an interesting horoscope altho' incomplete.  In answer to the
question: No, Mars can not be in two houses at the same time in the
natal or radix chart.  That is, it can not be two places in the
heavens at the same time.  It is conceivable that in a chart cast for
near the north pole such a thing could happen, but then it would
happen with more than one planet, this would be a peculiarity of the
house system being used.  The equal house Indian system precludes this
from happening.
I believe that this is a valid chart and the old jyotishi is saying
that when Mars either transits to the second house or moves there by
progressions, the object will be obtained.  This is a prediction and
the second house position is at another time from that of the birth
chart.  There is another possibility that the second house is in one
of the varga charts, but I doubt that this is the meaning of the
rather obscure quotation.
Will be interesting to find out what this is really all about.
Om NAMAISVAYA!
Devananda
