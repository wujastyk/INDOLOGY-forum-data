Death & Dying in Advaita Vedanta
Pat Williams requested material on Advaita eschatology.  May I suggest the
following:
R. Balasubramanian, "The Advaita View of Death and Immortality," in Death and
Immortality in the Religions of the World, ed. Paul and Linda Badham (New
York: Paragon House, 1987), 121ff.
Debabrata Sinha, "On Immortality and Death--Notes in a Vedantic Perspective"
in Perspectives on Vedanta: Essays in Honor of Professor P. T. Raju, ed.
S. S. Rama Rao Pappu (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1988), 170-181.
