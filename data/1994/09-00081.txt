I won't wait for you to have difficulty procuring it, I was able to
get the publisher's information without any trouble, and I think they
probably distribute only by direct mail.  Here they are:

  Babaji's Kriya Yoga and Publications
  165 rue de la Gauchetiere Ouest #608
  Montreal PQ Canada H2Z 1X6

  phone (514) 284-3551
