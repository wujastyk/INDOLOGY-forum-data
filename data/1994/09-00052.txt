Mountaineering
If you could separate the signal from all the cacaphonous noise 
I would suggest you to read the soc.culture.indian usenet newsgroup
to understand the "Religion and culture in India". If you already know
about this group then disregard this note. I usually don't have the habit 
of saving the articles from usenet groups, but there were very good articles
are posted from time to time on the topic of your interest.
Hope this info is helpful!
Regards,
Suresh.
