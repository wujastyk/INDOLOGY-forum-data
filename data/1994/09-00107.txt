The URL (Uniform Resource Locator) for the searchable databases at ANU 
is: http://cheops.anu.edu/11/Cooms-db

ANU's variety of Coombs databases can also be accessed using a gopher client
such as Turbogopher. In addition to the wais searchable files, they have 
separate sections for most of the Asian nations with links to related 
sites/files around the world. It's a very useful resource.
