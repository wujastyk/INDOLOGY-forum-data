napumsaka
Following up on Madhav's inquiry:
SuS'aa 3.5 has the following:
tatra s'ukrabaahulyaat pumaan, aartavabaahulyaat strii, saamyaadubhayor 
napumsakam
This may be a medical explanation of the grammatical definition; or
perhaps the grammatical explanation is another way of stating the
medical definition.
An interesting topic anyway one looks at it. Ken Zysk
