Association of South Asian Archaeologists
Does anyone know about plans for the next meeting of the Association of 
South Asian Archaeologists in Western Europe?  My understanding is that 
it will be held in Cambridge, either this or next summer.  Can anyone 
tell me which is correct, and/or whom to contact about it?
