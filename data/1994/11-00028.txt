quitting
Now I think I was clever when I decided to keep my old e-mail address
exclusively for the <indlogy> discussion group and the new one for 
ordinary e-mails. If I had only one address I should have missed some
important personal messages amid the floof of those political 
propagandas.
I wish someone like Dominik open another discussion group for
'Sanskrit studies'.
