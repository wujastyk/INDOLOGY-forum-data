Taoism, Shamanism, Hinduism etc changes in the Coombspapers Data Bank 
Dear Colleagues, 
(Apologies for any cross-posting) 
Six (6) Asian Religions subdirectories within the Coombspapers Social Sciences 
Research Data Bank at the ANU (available via ftp/gopher/www from 
coombs.anu.edu.au) have now changed their location. They have been taken out 
of their original place in the area called 
/coombspapers/otherarchives/electronic-buddhist-archives/, their overall 
directory name was changed from "other-asian-religions" to 
"asian-religions-archives" and their placement within the Coombspapers 
anonymous ftp archive is now as follows: 
DIRECTORY:  /coombspapers/otherarchives/asian-religions-archives 
Subdir:     /asian-religions-general 
Subdir:     /hassidism 
Subdir:     /hinduism 
Subdir:     /shamanism 
Subdir:     /sufism 
Subdir:     /taoism 
All relevant gopher links on the Coombsquest Gopher (coombs.anu.edu.au) have 
also been modified to reflect the change in the ftp path and thus all six 
subdirectories continue to be conveniently reacheable via the following gopher 
pointer: 
Name=Other Asian Religions 
Type=1 
Port=70 
Path=1/ResearchFacilities/BSF/OtherReligions 
Host=cheops.anu.edu.au 
Please adjust your pointers/records accordingly.   At the same time please note, 
that the path and other access details of the Coombspapers' Electronic Buddhist Archives 
themselves remain unchanged. 
- with many regards -
