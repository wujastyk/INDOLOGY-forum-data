Altar of Fire
Does anyone have or know of a bibliography of materials related to, and /
or written in response to, "Altar of Fire"?  (I do not mean works on Vedic
ritual per se, but rather directly related to Staal's project -- reviews,
follow-ups, etc. to both the book and the film).  I regret that as I am now
living in a remote location with no access to any research library, I am
unable to compile such a list myself.
(I know so far only the review by R. Paul noted by G. Samuel in his
recently posted film bibliography, and Heesterman's "Veda and Society: Some
remarks a propos of the film 'Altar of Fire'" in _Studia Orientalia_ 50
(1981): 51-64 -- both, I regret, not seen.)
Much thanks for any further references!
