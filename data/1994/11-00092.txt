RAMAYANA & MAHABHARATA e-texts
With reference to David Magier's message, it would be nice
if someone could post the exact e-mail address of the South Asia
Gopher and the Columbia ftp server (and of other sites which
cannot be inferred from those). It is indeed a good idea to
centralize this type of information. To disseminate the information
more widely, it may also be appropriate to post a brief table of
contents of available material on Usenet newsgroups such as
sci.lang, soc.culture.indian, soc.culture.tamil,... 
There is a proposal for a new sci.lang.sanskrit newsgroup.
Also, there are many classical musical compositions (with text and
sometimes notation) which have been posted on rec.music.indian.classical.
(Indian musical notation is relatively easy to put in ASCII form.)
Again, a centralized source of such material would be helpful.
