Robin, 

In answer to your query about the ftp site for INDOLOGY-related
Sanskrit texts, the site is ftp.bcc.ac.uk and the directory is
/pub/users/ucgadkw/indology.  Login as "anonymous" and give your email
address as a courtesey password.

The files will also percolate to the Liverpool INDOLOGY listserv,
where they will be available by email from the listserv and also
via the new INDOLOGY Gopher service.  This is perhaps the easiest way
to get stuff.  The Gopher address is gopher.liv.ac.uk.

Best wishes,

Dominik
