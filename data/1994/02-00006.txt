Would anybody happen to have information about the following two programs:

EasyCosmos (for the PC)
Voyager 2 (for the Mac)

These programs are able to show the sky as it was at different times in
history. I would particularly like to know the name of the producer, price
and where they can be obtained, but information about the relative merit of
the two programs would also be appreciated.

Best regards,
