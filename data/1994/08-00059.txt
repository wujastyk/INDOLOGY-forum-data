Kaccayano's padas
Hi!,
        Does anyone knows if the grammar of Kaccayano is available and
where is possible to get it. I have been readind the  comentary written by
Francis Mason in 1868 (Sri Satguru Publications, Delhi 1984), however I
woul like to read the real aphorisms and examples.
Regards. By the same token, does anyone knows if there is something like
the Dhatupada for Pali roots ?
