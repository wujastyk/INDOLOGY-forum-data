Subject: SNAKESKIN AND BOOKMARKS

          In several Sanskrit and Hindi Mss  that have been offered to  the 
          Library of Congress, one Ms has what appears to be fragments of a 
          snake's cast-off skin.   Is anyone aware  of religious or magical 
          uses of these in India, or  any reason why they should be kept in 
          a  book, beyond  books  being convenient for storing flat  things 
          like letters, addresses, and money?  The skin is  too delicate to 
          be useful for  a bookmark (as  I  found  when trying  to  wash  a 
          complete one  I found in  a  park  to  get  the smell off).  Does 
          anyone have any comments of things used for bookmarks or kept  in 
          books in Hindu India?  I  have found pressed flowers in  a couple 
          of mss in institutional libraries. 
          Somewhere in my notes I have a passag e copied from a Ms of rules 
          of reading and treatment of books, e.g. one  may  not  read lying 
          down, but I don't recall any ruleson inserting thing s in books.
