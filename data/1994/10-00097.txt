Could you answer these questions, please?
Hello:
I was wondering if you would be able to answer two questions for me:
1) What is the research going on the city of Dwarka (the one Indian
archaeologists claimed to be Krishna's city)?
2) Is there any evidence in favor of Krishna's historicity?
I have been looking for these answers intensenly in the past two to three days:
any and all help will be greatly appreciated.
Sincerely yours,
Binoy K. Samuel
