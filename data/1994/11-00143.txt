Gentlemen:

FYI, the editors of Hinduism Today welcome letters by email.   You may
write to :

In addition to the email server mentioned by Dr. Conlan, you can also
access the current issue of Hinduism Today on WWW at:

   http://err.ethz.ch/~kiwi/Spirit/Veda/HT/Overview.html

The timeline articles are also available by anonymous FTP from the ANU
Coombspapers archive, for which there are several well known links,
including the SAG Gopher at Columbia.

Congenial regards,
