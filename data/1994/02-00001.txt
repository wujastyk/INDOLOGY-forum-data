KAMA SUTRAM MANUSCRIPTS
          The Library of Congress has abt. 550 Sanskrit mss not  in Poleman 
          listed in  a card index and about 50 others with no list but they 
          contain no mss of the Kamasutra or other Kamasastra works. 
          The researcher should  also  check  art museums, which  may  have 
          acquired illustrated Kamasutra mss for the illustrations.
