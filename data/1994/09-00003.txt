Planets and Horoscopes
It is utterly impossible for a planet to inhibit in two houses at once.
If you send me the horoscope I will check the date and I will
tell you whether it is a fake or not.  There are many computer
programs for astronomy and astrology, but I use my own program
based on the Suryasiddhanta.
