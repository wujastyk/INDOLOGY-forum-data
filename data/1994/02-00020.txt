Language Programs in India
I have a student who's planning to pursue graduate studies in South Asian 
Studies and is hoping to find a language training program in India. He's 
looking for a program that does intensive training in an Indian language 
(he's open on the question of which one). Can anyone recommend any good long-
term study programs for Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Marathi, etc.? I already told 
him about the U. of Wisconsin and American Institute of Indian Studies 
programs. Thanks in advance for any suggestions.
