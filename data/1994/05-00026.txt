Dasakumaracarita
Thanks are due to Lars Martin Fosse for adding another text to our swelling
archive of machine-readable Sanskrit texts.  Lars has presented selections
from the Dasakumaracarita of Dandin (chs. 3, 5, 6).
The file is available as dandin-dasakumaracarita.zip from
ftp.bcc.ac.uk:/pub/users/ucgadkw/indology.
I append some notes on the file, from Lars's readme.
Many thanks, Lars,
Dominik
