Location of Kamasutram mss.
I am now assembling mss. for a critical edition of the Kamasutram with a new
English translation.  Having noted the accessibility of most non-published mss.
in Indian archives, libraries, etc., I am now trying to locate the availability
of the same in museums and odther collections in the U.S. and Europe.  If you
know of such holdings, please contact me at my e-mail address.  I am interested
in Sanskrit mss. which do and do not contain Indian miniature paintings, line
drawings, etc.  THANKS!
