Bibliography of Asian Studies
     Bibliography of Asian Studies
     -----------------------------
Dear members,
What happened to Bibliography of Asian studies (BAS) from Association
of Asian Studies, Univ. of Michigan? The advertisements for new
voulmes used to appear in Journal of Asian Studies. The last BAS
I saw was for the year 1986 published in 1991. It used to be a very good
source for knowing the titles of articles on India. Atleast, the new
book titles can be found thru' computer catalogs of university
libraries, but not the journal articles.
Hope BAS hasn't ceased its publication.
