List of PhD theses
     Can anybody help me? Is there any available information on the 
hundreds of indological PhD theses which have not been ever published?
The theses submitted to Indian universities would be particularly 
useful for me.
     I am looking for grammatical analyses of Old Tamil and Middle Tamil 
texts and indexes of texts (such as V.I. Subramoniam's 'Index of 
PuranaanuuRu'). Any information on studies dealing in such way with the 
Tamil Bhakti texts is welcome.
     Thank you in advance.
