Hi everibody, let me introduce me, my name is xavier Martin-Dupont, I'm
french student in linguistic field (so my english is prety bad) and I'm
reading this list with a lot of interest (one of my interest topic's is
historical Linguistic : ). I'm also quite interested by the work of
G.Dumezil (comparated mythology, cf Mythe et epopee 3t galimard bibiotheque
des sciences humaine) and the E.Benveniste studies : le vocabulaire des
institutions indo-europeennes (2t edition de minuit col le sens commun)...
and so on
