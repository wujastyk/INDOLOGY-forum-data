Indological PhDs and few Old Tamil Ref's
I don't know if this has been mentioned, but the gopher-based University
Microfilms Inc (UMI) database of doctoral dissertations is a good place to
locate theses on just about any topic.
The database itself has a useful keyword search facility and there are
instructions for ordering copies (cost around $36) by phone or fax. A search
on "Buddhism" brings up a lot, but I don't know about other aspects of Indology.
There's a tie-in from the Journal of Buddhist Ethics WWW Global Resources
page. Access is available via:
