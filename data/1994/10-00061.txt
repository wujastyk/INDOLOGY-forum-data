As I understand their objection is based on economic ground. If they are 
forced to provide education of Sanskrit even though optional they will 
have to hire at least one more teacher. As CBSE schools are private and 
for profit organizations, they want to look at their bottom line. As they 
see it there is no great demand for teaching sanskrit and if anyone still 
wants it he/she may go to non-CBSE school, as far as they are concerned.

That is a joke. Like the discussion of a Sanskrit speaking village. I 
wonder who uses Sanskrit news as their only news bulletin. It is more of 
an entertainment or education.

Whatever, the reason what is wrong with that? why should any language be 
imposed on anyone?
It is mostly Hindi speakers who are source of this animosity since it 
became the official language.
