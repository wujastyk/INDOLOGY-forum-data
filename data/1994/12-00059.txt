According to Jean Verpoorten: Mi at ma@m at sa@-
literature (A History of Indian Literature, fasc.5 Wiesbaden 1987:
Harrassowitz), Ma at dhava-Vidya@ran at ya (a Mi at ma@m at sa@-
author) lived in the 14th cty A.D.

The Veda at nta-author Sa at yan@a-Ma at dhava, author of
the Sarvadarc at anasam@graha, is also said to have lived in the
14th cty. (see Frauwallner, Geschichte der Indischen Philosophie, 
Bd I., Salzburg 1953, p.13). Mimaki 1976 (La refutation bouddhique de la
permanence des choses....Paris), however, has his dates as 
1199-1278 A.D.

I hope this is confusing enough. 

The diacritics in this post, BTW, are given according to a system which
is (rather) widely used in Japan and, IMHO, extremely useful. Every
diacritical mark is given with an _ at _ after the corresponding alphabet
letter. Long a, thus, is _a@_ etc. 
As for the ambivalent marks:

[An@ is the cerebral n
g@ is the palatal n
s@ is the cerebral s
c@ is the palatal s.

Of all ASCII-transcription-tables I have encountered so far, 
this is the most effective, as it not only allows for conversion of
e-texts alone, but also of papers etc. which include Western
languages, too. Moreover, it is easily convertible into any
word-processor's format, too. Anyway, this is a topic for a 
different post, I guess.
