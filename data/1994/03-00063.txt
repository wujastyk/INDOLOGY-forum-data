NEW BOOK: WORLD RELIGIONS
I am looking for a copy of the BJP's White Paper on Ayodhya and
the Ram Temple Movement (New Delhi: BJP, 1993). Library of Congress
#93903927.  Can anyone help?  As far as I can tell only the University of
Washington and Duke University have this in their library holdings but
neither will lend to Canada.  Thanks for any help.
