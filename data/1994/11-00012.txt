"Self-Alienated Hindus"
I know I'll probably regret this later, but I can't help noticing a 
similarity here to another 'ethnic phenomenon': when moderate Jews spoke out 
against the oppression of Palestinians by Israel, Zionist extremists 
dismissed them as 'self-hating Jews' and even as 'anti-semitic Jews'. 
Some even claimed that their political stance against the Israeli 
treatment of Palestinians meant that they 'weren't really Jews at all'. 
As if such educated, soft-spoken analysis of the wrongness of ethnic 
intolerance were fundamentally incompatible with their own membership in 
their ethnic group!
