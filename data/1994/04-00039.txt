Quwalli Music and Ghazals (fwd)
Re: Quwalli Music and Ghazals
Does anyone know how to contact Dr. Regual Quereshi?  I am looking for 
her mailing address....  She has written about the musical tradition of 
qawwali music in Pakistan....  Please reply to my private mail box as 
opposed to the list, thanks in advance,
