MANUSMRTI AGAIN
            Re:  Another odd sidelight on the Manusmrti 
            A patron today asked what part of India Manusmrti was.  She had 
          apparently read  that  in Manusmrti Kshattriyas did something  or 
          other and she didn't know where. It would follow that if anything 
          is rem oved from it India will lose territory.
