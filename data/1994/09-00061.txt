Aryans and Dravidians
Whether or not there were conflicts or other relations of whatever
nature between Aryans and Dravidians three or four millennia ago,
surely at some point in time rather distant from us the distinction
ceases to be salient with regard to many cultural phenomena in the
Subcontinent including religious developments.  Even if there were
severe conflict extending for several centuries, how important
could that be for, say, understanding religious developments
within the last thousand years?  Moreover, the distinction is not
one, I dare to say, that gets much play in classical texts--though I
wonder if in Tamil classical texts (as opposed to Sanskrit, Pali,
and Tibetan), the distinction is made much of.  Is there a classical
Tamil scholar out there?
