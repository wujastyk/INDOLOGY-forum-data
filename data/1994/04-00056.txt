The Department of Religion, Columbia University, announces a position
in classical Hinduism.  Candidates at the assistant and nontenured
associate professor level can be considered for this 5-year term
appointment; Ph.D. required.  Teaching responsibilities will include
both graduate and undergraduate courses, some of them assuming a
knowledge of Sanskrit.  An additional major responsibility will be the
development of the new Dharam Hinduja Indic Research Center, of which
the appointee will act as Director; therefore leadership qualities and
administrative aptitude are essential.  Academic interests of a
particular relevance to the DHIRC are Veda, Vedanga (including
Ayurveda), Vedanta, shastra, and the long history of interpretation
associated with the Vedic tradition, in the broadest sense, and with
classical Hindu texts and ideas.
Further information about DHIRC is available upon request from Robert
A.F. Thurman, chair, Department of Religion, Kent Hall, Columbia
University, New York, NY 10027 (212-854-3218), to whom applications
should be addressed.  The deadline for applications is May 10, 1994,
but candidates are urged to submit materials as soon as possible: a
vita, three letters of reference, and a small sampling of relevant
publications.  Columbia University is an affirmative action/equal
opportunity employer.  Women and members of minority groups are urged
to apply.
