Aryans and Dravidians
 I wish to preface this note by the fact that I am not a professional 
Indologist, and I defer to the other learned sages on the net. Here 
are some rejoinders to this discussion..
 In reference to Chris Minkowski's note, I do wish to point out that 
a belief that the world was created in 3000 BC would compel a person 
to chronologies within that limit. I disavow the extrapolation  
that being Christian excludes rationalality; I meant no more than 
Muellers functioning under a limited vision of physical reality 
(typical of all folks of the time). Max Mueller remains a primary 
systemitizer of the picture of ancient India, and even though the 
picture is being reformulated. His views have therefore have had an 
impact on contemporary culture and polity in India, and overturning 
of his scholarship is non-trivial. Equivalently, the new picture 
which will emerge as an intersection set of many disciplines like 
linguistics, archeology, remote sensing, genetics etc will also have 
a powerful impact on the future culture and polity of India. It seems 
to me that at best we can only look at a spectrum of possibilities, 
some very much more likely than others. I do believe that neo-vedic 
nationalism belongs to a section of people who need to believe this 
to feel good about themselves; It does not have a place in historical 
science.
