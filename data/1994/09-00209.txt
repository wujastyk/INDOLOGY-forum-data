statistical data
I too would be very interested in discovering such a database, of the
same type as the Geographic Names Server at University of Michigan
(which unfortunately only covers North America). Please let me know if
you find anything of this sort.
This kind of demographic information, of course, is to be found in the
Census of India. Latest figures would be found in the 1991 Census,
whose volumes and results are still being issued.
Can't think of any one central source for this sort of varied
information...
