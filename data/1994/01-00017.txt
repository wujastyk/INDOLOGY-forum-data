SNAKESKIN AND BOOKMARKS
Though I cannot answer specifically about snakeskins, I am aware of
the practice of putting flowers, specifically remnants of the deity's
prasad in northern Indian Vaishnava sects.  This is not anything other
than a spontaneous practice and not one that is prescribed anywhere.
