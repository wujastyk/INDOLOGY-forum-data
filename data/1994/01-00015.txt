Sanskrit transliteration font for the Mac.?
Madhav Deshpande at the University of Michigan has developed both devanagari
and Sanskrit transliteration fonts for use with both PC and Mac.  I have the
PC version and find both the devanagari and transliteration programs to be
useful.  Contact him for ordering information.  Given the difficulty of develop
ing a feasible program with devanagari characters, the price is reasonable and
the effectiveness of the program is more than adequate.
