I recall seeing a message about a Buddhist practice of observing stars,
either on INDOLOGY or BUDDHA-L.  My attempts to keyword search the
archives of both groups failed to retrieve the message.

I'd appreciate receiving any information on the subject, for an
anthropologist using our library.  Thanks in advance.
