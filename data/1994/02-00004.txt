Subject: RE: Astronomical programs

Lars,

I include the following excerpt, (by Hal Perkins who was kind enough to share
his thoughts some months ago)

"The answer is Voyager II from Carina Software.  It's about $100 from
the mailorder houses.  It will do everything you mention and lots
more-- watch a solar eclipse from the moon, sit on pluto and watch the
voyager ships move out from the earth, just about anything you can
think of.  Full set of coordinate displays, displays constellations,
planets, deep sky objects, etc.  Particularly spectacular displays on
a medium to large color monitor.

There are cheaper astronomy programs out there, but none are in the
same class as Voyager.  If you want something that will really get
students excited this is it."

Would anybody happen to have information about the following two programs:

EasyCosmos (for the PC)
Voyager 2 (for the Mac)

These programs are able to show the sky as it was at different times in
history. I would particularly like to know the name of the producer, price
and where they can be obtained, but information about the relative merit of
the two programs would also be appreciated.

Best regards,
