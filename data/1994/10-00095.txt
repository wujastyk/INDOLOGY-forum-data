Does anybody know how you can print CSX characters on a laser printer? I
can run my computer in CSX mode and get all the right characters on screen,
but I cannot print them. (I don't use Windows, by the way). Is there a way
to get correct printout without Windows, or for that matter: is it possible
to get correct printouts *with* Windows. And if so: Where do I get the
right print files, if such files exist.

Best regards,
