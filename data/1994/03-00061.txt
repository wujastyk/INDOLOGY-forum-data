Unreversible Transliteration
    Jim Agenbroad seems unaware of the practice used by most Prakrit
scholars for distinguishing 'ai' as a single vowel and 'ai' as a 
sequence of 'a'+'i'.  The common practice is to have the second vowel
umlauted if it is an independent vowel.  That clears the confusion.
