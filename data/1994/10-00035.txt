Israeli government decided to revive it. I did not mean any offense to 
those who speak Hebrew now. 
You repeated my word: REVIVED 
How can other religionists have equal rights in Israel when any and only 
Jews who are citizens of any country can automatically become citizen of 
Israel but Muslims living in the same political  territory are denied 
rights of citizenship. Israel as much a theocracy as vatican, UK or 
Pakistan etc all of which have a state supported religion. India does not 
have any state supported religion as yet but if BJP came to power then it 
may change.
