The Columbia Book of Indian Poetry
Dear colleagues,
This project has been in the making for some years; two of its moving 
spirits, Barbara Stoler Miller and A. K. Ramanujan, have recently passed 
away.  Their third collaborator, Vinay Dharwadker, is determined to bring 
it to a conclusion.  He is soliciting manuscript and published 
translations from all periods and all South Asian languages.  He is 
hoping to wrap up his collection of material in the next few months.
Unfortunately, Vinay is not quite hooked up to email yet.  So he can be 
reached at:  Department of English, University of Oklahoma, Gittinger 
Hall 113, Norman, Oklahoma 73019.  His office phone is 405-325-4661.  He 
does not mind being called at home, at 405-360-4361.  Or he can be 
reached by fax:  either 405-325-0831 or 325-5068.
A contribution to this volume would be a nice tribute to Barbara and 
Raman; the many people who knew them and miss them might wish to consider 
sending something.  Vinay says, "Each piece included in the book will have 
to succeed on its own as a poem in its English version."  This is a high 
standard to meet, but certainly Barbara and Raman would have wanted 
nothing less.
