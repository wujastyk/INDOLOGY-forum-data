Subject: Query: Buddha as an avatar of Vishnu
Message-ID: <161227017880.23782.6522673252747391647.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Colleagues, I reproduce herewith a query just received and posted on 
H-ASIA.  Professor Rabe appears to be seeking works in translation, but 
further discussion of the question of identification of the Buddha as an 
avatar and suggestions for further sources on the subject would be 
appreciated. Thank you.
