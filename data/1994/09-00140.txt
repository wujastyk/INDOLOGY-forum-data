Aryans and the Indian homeland
Right on, Dominik! I appreciate your input and attitude in this 
discussion. We have never met, but I hope we do soon. One of the 
great things about e-mail discussions like this is that one gets 
a good sense of the fellow scholars in cyberspace one looks forward 
to meeting in addition to reading more from.
