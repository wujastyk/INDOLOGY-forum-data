Subject: Indic and SEAsian fonts

In answer to inquiries by Tom Greer and others,
 
Ecological Linguistics has a full range of Indic and Southeast Asian Postscript
and TrueType fonts (including even several older alphabets no longer in active
use; excluding Oriya) intended primarily for Macintosh, where the keyboarding
is extremely convenient.
 
(These are usable also in Windows TrueType with WordPerfect 5.2 or with other
utilities which permit user remapping of the keyboard arrangement.)
 
Best quality for the price available.  Rated the "best foreign language laser
fonts around" for the last two years by the very active Berkeley Macintosh
Users' Group.
 
For a free complete catalog, please indicate the alphabets of most interest to
you and:
