Info on Jamadagni/Parashuram requested
In my research on the social reform of devadasis in Karnataka/Maha
rashtra I was continually referred to the Jamadagni/Parushram myth.
Renuka, in the local form of Yellamma is the major goddess to which
devadasis are dedicated. (Matangi is another.) I have been looking
at how local versions are narrated, often to present a subaltern
point of view. And in this particular chapter (where I am bogged
down!) I am addressing the father-son relationship contra the
mother. I am aware of some of the versions of the high myth. But,
I am not a religious specialist. I would like to contexualize
these local narratives more fully with further historical/mythical
information on the myth. Can any of you help? I have listed
several queries below.
1. What historical/mythical/religious sources are there for
   this myth?
2. How do the Saivite and Vaishnaivite versions vary?
3. Given #2 what are the geneaological relationships?
4. Is Parushrama's parentage, or his relationship to either
   parent, contentious in any of these sources?
5. Are there any sustained academic discussions/interpretations
   on this myth? (Articles? books?)
6. Do you think this myth lends itself well to a psychoanalytic
   interpretation? Other?
7. And finally. What sources of a similar nature are there that
   illustrate the father's role, duty, especially in relation
   to the son? Vice versa, son to father? (Succint quotes? sections?)
