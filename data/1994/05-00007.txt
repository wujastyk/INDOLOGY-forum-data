Some months ago, Ashok Aklujkar generously made available to us all his
machine readable transcription of the Paatanjala Yogasuutras.  These files
have been available for some time at the site
"blackbox.hacc.washington.edu", courtesy of Tom Ridgeway.

I have now made a copy of Ashok's text available at "ftp.bcc.ac.uk" in the
directory public/users/ucgadkw/indology and also at Liverpool for retrieval
by email in the normal way (send a message "help" to
"listserv at liverpool.ac.uk" to find out more).

Enjoy, thanks to Ashok.
