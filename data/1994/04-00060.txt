Confer. New Indo-Aryan Languages
I am convening the conference and have just mailed the Third Circular to 
all those who have so far expressed interest in attending. I will mail 
this information to anyone who sends me their address. The circular 
includes a provisional list of papers and reservation form for on-campus 
board and lodging package. 
	There is a registration fee (payable on arrival) of $65, which 
pays for paper abstracts & program, refreshments, reception, banquet, 
and perhaps some entertainment on Saturday night. 
	We have about fifty papers grouped in panels on Hagiography, 
Oral Tradition, Metaphors, Sacred Places, Islam in the Indian Context, 
Text Criticism, and a catch-all "Miscellaneous". We can perhaps squeeze 
in one or two extra papers - but will need to know about this as soon as 
possible. Papers should directly address literary texts from the late
Apabhramsa period up to the early 19th century.
