Access to wihm.ucl.ac.uk
Dominik,
Yes, this is a known "problem" and I'll be working on this shortly. A brief
bit of history:
Some four or five weeks ago we got wind of users in the US using our xigs
Telnet/X.29 convertor box as a "launch pad" for "attacks" on systems back
in the States - use of this box effectively "hid" their identity from admin
on the systems they were attacking. As a result, we restricted access to
this box to calling addresses (in both the Telnet and X.29 address spaces)
which were "owned" by UCL. This effectively barred calls in fromn the US.
Unfortunately the access control mechanisms have the knock-on effect of
similarly controlling "seamless" calls through the box to advertised
services. Now a telnet call to wihm.ucl.ac.uk is transparently forwarded
through the controlled device with the results you report, ie. you can call
wihm.ucl.ac.uk from ucl/bcc addresses but not from elsewhere.
I'm going to try to remove this bar on calls to wihm.ucl.ac.uk (ie. make it
unrestricted) while preserving current security "controls" for calls
EXPLICITLY made to xigs.ucl.ac.uk.
I'll keeped you posted on this.
Apologies for any inconvenience, etc,
Bob
