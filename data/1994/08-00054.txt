Dear colleagues, 

Does any one of you know of obituaries of Norman Mosley Penzer 
(1892-1960, the editor of "The Ocean of Story" etc.) besides 
the very brief one that appeared in the Geographical Journal? 
The JRAS does not appear to have one and he is not in the DNB. 

I am particularly interested in learning from which institution(s) 
and in which field(s) he obtained an M.A. and a D.Litt.

Thanks, 

Rosane Rocher
