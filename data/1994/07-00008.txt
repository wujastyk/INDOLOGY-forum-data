Subject: Taking a computer to India
Message-ID: <161227016945.23782.15910661529372994315.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

A friend of mine plans to take a Mac SE to India for a year.  She is
asking for recommendations on computer insurance, specifically any
company in the USA that will insure the computer such that she could
buy a replacement computer if the SE breaks down or gets lost or stolen.
If anyone has any experiences or recommendations to share I will pass
them on.  Thanks, Tim Bryson (bryson at harvarda.harvard.edu)
