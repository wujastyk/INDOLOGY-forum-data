This is certainly a reasonable sort of feature to have found and

Frawley's work.  This is pretty darned grey literature.
I did find three relevant references:
1)  Ahmad, F.  "Man, environment and geology since 2000 B.C. in 
    Indo-Gangetic Valley."  1989.  (INTERNATIONAL GEOLOGICAL CONGRESS, 
    ABSTRACTS--CONGRES GEOLOGIQUE INTERNATIONALE, RESUMES. ; Vol. 28, No. 
    1, p. 18)
2)  Ahmad, F.  "Geological evidence bearing on the origin of the 
    Rajasthan Desert (India)."  1986.  (PROCEEDINGS OF THE INDIAN 
    NATIONAL SCIENCE ACADEMY, PART A: PHYSICAL SCIENCES ; Vol. 52, No. 6, 
    p. 1285-1306)
3)  Murthy, S. R. N.  "The Vedic River Saraswati, a myth or fact; a 
    geological approach."  Nov. 1980.  (INDIAN J. HIST. SCI. ; Vol. 15, 
    No. 2, p. 189-192)
Finding such a feature on a LANDSAT photo is still a separate issue from 
showing that 1) the two really are the same river; and 2) it dried up 
prior to 1900 BC.  One key question would be, what did they use to 
establish this date this precisely.  I would expect dendrochronology to 
be the best tool, assuming they've done some field work;  C-14 dating 
would be a close second.

Re: Vedic "Saraswati" River
...this thread is very intriguing indeed! I had an opportunity to visit 
Vira-vah and Nagar-Parkar, both in Pakistan, just north of the small Rann 
of Kutch. Although presently there is no city there (only small villages) 
a walk around Vira-vah is most interesting. There are large ruins of 
palace like structure and some pretty large temples (also in ruins) 
overgrown vegetation seems to taking over the temple that I saw. There 
was a large lake. It had water only when there was heavy rains. The 
general feeling I got after being there for about 1 year (we were 
constructing "sand" tracks for the Indian Army after '71 war) that there 
must have been a river (or canal) around there to sustain this sort of 
constructed buildings. My guess was that a canal or tributary of Indus  
flowed thour that region. It is possible that this could have been waters 
of the River Saraswati if the course of the river was indeed from Punjab 
to the Rann. I think the achaelogists could benefit by doing research in 
the Nagar Parkar area. Unfortunately its not very accessible from 
Pakistan side (no road at that time!) however one could easily drive from 
Bhuj via the Rann but watch out for rainy season, the Rann is easily 
"flooded" even with small rainfall.
