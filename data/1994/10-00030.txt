    Needless to say, none of these statements is true.  Sanskrit has a
continuous living tradition, and remains a spoken language among pandits and
others.  Hebrew also remained a living language of scholarship and religion,
and was revived as an everyday language by *secular* Zionists--religious
Jews opposed this profane use of the holy tongue.  Israel is a democratic
state with equal rights for Islam, Christianity, and other non-Jewish
religions; it is no more a "theocracy" than India.
