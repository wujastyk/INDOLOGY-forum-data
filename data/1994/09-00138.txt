Bibliography of Asian Studies
I recently received a notice announcing publication of the 1987 and 1988 
editions of the Bibliography of Asian Studies.  A recent posting on the 
History - Asia network indicated others will soon follow, and the 
Association for Asian Studies is also producing a CD ROM version.
