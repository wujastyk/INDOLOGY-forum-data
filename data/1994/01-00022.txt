RE: A Question on Medicine
Is there a bibliography of texts which mention surgical techniques ? The
general information on the history of Indian medicine usually refers to
Sushruta only, when talking of surgery.It would be nice to braoden one's
perspective.

Jonathan,
My first guess on the medical meaning of "sword or staff" would be
general surgery. Various types of surgical techniques are mentioned in
the Buddhist texts I have examined. KZ
