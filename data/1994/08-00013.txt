Skt. Grammar Query
   Michael Sweet has asked about the meaning of a line in the
Siddhanta-Kaumudi (on Pa. 6.3.75) left untranslated by Vasu.  In
the query some words were inadvertently left out of the line as
quoted; the full version is "na stri puman napumsakam
stri-pumsayoh [the space after "stri" in Vasu is incorrect]
pumsakabhavo nipatanat."
   The first part of this, "na stri puman napumsakam," is a
gloss of the compound "na-pumsaka": neither feminine nor
masculine = neuter.  The rest answers the question of how
"na-pumsaka" can mean "neither feminine nor masculine" rather
than simply "not masculine," since "pumsaka" should mean only
"masculine."  To put it the other way around, why is the word
not "na-stri-pumsaka"?  The answer is "stri-pumsayoh
pumsakabhavo nipatanat": (in the word "napumsaka" both) feminine
and masculine are "pumsaka" because of nipatana (i.e., just
because Panini gives the word in the form "napumsaka").
   Or at least that's my guess.
