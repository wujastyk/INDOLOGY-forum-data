Subject: Transliteration Macros for WP
Message-ID: <161227016759.23782.16612491237269590277.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I remember seeing a WP 5.1 macro at the University of Tubingen which did
some kind of transliteration automatically.  I don't remember the details,
unfortunately. Perhaps this will jog other people's memory, though.
