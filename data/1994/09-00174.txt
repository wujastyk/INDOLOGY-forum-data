>From a brochure of a car rental firm in Tokyo:
       When passenger of foot heave in sight, tootle the horn.
       Trumpet him melodiously at first, but if he still obstacles
       your passage, tootle him with vigor.

Two signs from a Majorcan shop entrance:
       -  English well talking
       -  Here speeching American

Sign in a shop in Merida, Mexico:
       Broken English spoken fluently.
