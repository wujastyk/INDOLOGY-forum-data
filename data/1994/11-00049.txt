No subject
Jonathan Silk has complained that he got no responses to his technical
questions. Apart from a handful of bodhisattva scholars like Lance
Cousins, who make efforts to reply when they can, most learned
list members eem to lurk and smirk at the anguished confusions of
the likes of Jonathan and, indeed, myself (still no reply on my
nidhi query; what did nidhi mean in the Kausiaksutra and the
Grhyasutras? (pardon slip of keyboard: can not rectify mistakes
on this system!).
I agree, the best way to end soap-box ranting is to introduce
more academic discussion. Can anyone answer Jonathan Silk's
questions?
