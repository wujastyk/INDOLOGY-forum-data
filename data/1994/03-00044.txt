Transvetism
For a colleague doing cross-cultural research on transvestism I would 
appreciate any relavant references, posted here or sent to me directly. I 
have already referred him to Michael Sweet's chapter in _Buddhism, 
Sexuality and Gender_, but there must be more I am not aware of. 
Thanks!
