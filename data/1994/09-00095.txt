Hi,

Does anyone know of an English translation of the book "Les Quatre Sens 
de la Vie" by Alain Danielou ?

I am afraid I do not know who the publisher of the original French book 
is. The book, I hear has a discussion of the caste system.

Thanks in addvance for letting me know,

Dileep S Karanth
