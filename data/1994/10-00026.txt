RELIGIOUS/CULTURE NATIONALISM AND FUNDAMENTALISM IN SOUTH ASIA AND SOUTHEAST 
ASIA
A conference co-hosted by Faculty of Arts, Deakin University,
Monash Asia Institute, National Centre for South Asian Studies,
Asian Law Centre University of Melbourne.
The conference will explore the recent fracturing of established
societiesinto disparate communal and fervently religious or
cultural groupings - an issue that comes out of the wider discourse
of 'fundamentalism'.
Significantly, the papers presented will examine the relationship
between religious/cultural self-assertion and emergent nationalism
or claims to ethnic-based nation-state particularities, generally
against the challenges of globisation in the region.  Critique of
fundamentalism as a socio-cultural phenomenon, its historical and
philosophical roots, and the interface of society and state and
their implications for secularism, minority rights and the
democratic process will be examined.  There will be a comparitive
focus on South Asia and South-East Asia.  Issues related to the
broad theme of Western responses to the phenomenon of
fundamentalism against the horizon of Orientalism will also be
addressed.
Venue:   Toorak Campus, Deakin University,
