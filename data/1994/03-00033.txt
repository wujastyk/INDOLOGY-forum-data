Devanagari Fonts?
Namaskaaram
I'm looking for a good devanaagarii font for the Macintosh and laser printer
(PostScript or TrueType), having just upgraded from a dot matrix printer.  Is
there any good free/shareware out there?  Does anyone have any feedback on
LaserHindi Sanskrit from Linguist's Software?  I'm new to the list.
