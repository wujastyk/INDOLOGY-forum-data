I must agree with Prof. Yano.  As a graduate student in the field, I find 
these political propagandas useless.  Since i have been on this list, i 
have found scholarly discussions useful.  Everytime one of these 
non-schalarly items enters the list, it generates this very same 
discussion.  I believe, that those who monitor the list should try to 
keep useless materials out.  This list should focus on what it was meant 
for : a forum for discussion of scholarly material of the study of 
ancient India.
