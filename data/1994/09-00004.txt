Conservation of Nature in Classical India?
Hello, I am in search of references/pointers to Nature
protection/conservation and ecological awareness in the Classical
Age. Was there such a concept at all? Was it warranted in the first
place, what with the absence of polluting industries and motor cars
etc?
I do remember reading that there were protected reserves/Natural
resorts and sanctuaries for wild animals during Asoka's time. Is this
true? Can someone give me references?
Thanks very much.
