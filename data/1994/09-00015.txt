Aryans and Dravidians
In connection with my work on Hindu Temple Priests, I am looking for 
material on the question of the Aryan invasion, feuds between Aryans 
and Dravidians, the north being Aryan and the south Dravidian etc,etc.
The main reason for this is that in my interviews with Brahmin priests
in Maharashtra, I heard again and again that" Shiva being a non Aryan
deity, we Aryan Brahmins do not worship him with the same devotion".
There is thus still a perception amongst northern Brahmins that they 
are Aryans.
While I appreciate that the Aryan invasion theory is now discredited,
I have not been able to find good review material which critically 
discusses these issues.
Could someone please help me locate such material.
