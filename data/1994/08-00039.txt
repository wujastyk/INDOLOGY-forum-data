Routledge Encyclopedia
Thanks to all of you who responded to my request for suggestions
for possible authors for articles on Indian and Tibetan philosophy
for the new Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy. I shall answer
all your messages individually, but it will take several days to
sort through them all and write replies. Meanwhile, please accept
this less personal expression of collective gratitude.
