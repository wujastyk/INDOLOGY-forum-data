article on roots of VHP
As others have noted, the day after my request for
good material on "Hindu fundamentalism," the JAAR
appeared with an article by James Lochtefeld, called
"The Visva Hindu Parishad and the Roots of Hindu
Militancy."  Perhaps most interesting is his discussion
of the history of samnyasi violence in north India.
