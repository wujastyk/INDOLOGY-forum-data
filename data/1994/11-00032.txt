Politics
Let's keep a little bit of perspective, shall we? A few political
statements hardly make for "the politicisation of Indology". More
time and energy has gone into all the soul searching these statements
have occasioned than into anything I've seen on the list for a long
time. If people are really concerned about this intrusion of politics
into the pristine world of indological scholarship, perhaps a vote
should be held among members to decide whether or not the list
should become moderated (presuming, of course, that someone is willing
to volunteer to fill the role).
