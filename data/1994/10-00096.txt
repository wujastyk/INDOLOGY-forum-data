Title: Vinaya in Theravaada Temples in the United States
Author: Paul David Numrich
Publication Date: October 24th 1994
 
ABSTRACT
 
 //Vinaya// (the monastic discipline) plays an essential role in
defining traditional Theravaada Buddhism. This article examines the
current state of //vinaya// recitation and practice in the nearly 150
immigrant Theravaada Buddhist temples in the United States, and also
speculates on the prospect of traditional Theravaada's firm
establishment in this country. Specific //vinaya// issues discussed
include the //paatimokkha// ceremony, the discussion about //vinaya//
adaptation to the American context, adaptations in the areas of
monastic attire and relations with women, and principles of adaptation
at work in Theravaada temples in the United States.
