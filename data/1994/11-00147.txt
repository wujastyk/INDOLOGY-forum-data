Research Article:
 
CAUSATION AND //TELOS//: THE PROBLEM OF BUDDHIST ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS
 
Author: Ian Harris
Publication Date: November 27th, 1994
 
ABSTRACT
 
     Environmentalist concerns have moved centre stage in most major
religious traditions of late and Buddhism is no exception to this
rule. This paper shows that the canonical writings of Indic Buddhism
possess elements that may harmonise with a //de facto// ecological
consciousness. However, their basic attitude towards the causal
process drastically reduces the possibility of developing an
authentically Buddhist environmental ethic. The classical treatment of
causation fails to resolve successfully the tension between symmetry
and asymmetry of relations and this has tended to mean that attempts
to inject a //telos//, or sense of purpose, into the world are likely
to founder. The agenda of eco-Buddhism is examined in the light of this
fact and found wanting.
