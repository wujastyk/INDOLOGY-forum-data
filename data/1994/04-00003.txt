Sanskrit as national language
What a wonderful idea! Choosing Sanskrit sidesteps the regional languages 
problem in favor of their common ancestor. Even the Dravidian speakers 
use Sanskrit for religious purposes, correct?
If a country loses its language, it loses most of its cultural identity 
(cf., Bretagne, Scotland, Guatemala).
