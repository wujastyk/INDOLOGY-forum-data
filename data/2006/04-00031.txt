Dating of the Vaayaviiyasa.mhitaa ?
Dear Dr. Palaniappan,
I don't think that it is likely to be possible to pin down the date  
of your lines very precisely.  Have you already had a look at R.C.  
Hazra's "Studies in the Puraa.nic Records on Hindu Rites and  
Customs" (Dacca, 1940), pp.141--5, where he discusses the dating of  
the Garu.dapuraa.na and comes to the conclusion that it is probable  
that much of the extant Garu.dapuraa.na was composed between 850 and  
1000 AD ?
Other list-members are no doubt better informed than I am about  
current thinking on the dating of this text and of the  
Vaayaviiyasa.mhitaa, which Hazra does not discuss (at least not in  
this book, except to make clear that he thinks it later than the  
Vaayupuraa.na).
As for the "liberalism" of these puraa.nic passages, it seems indeed  
to be not strong, since the point of both is of course rather to  
emphasise rhetorically the extraordinary potency of bhakti.
