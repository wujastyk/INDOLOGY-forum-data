Source of Brahminhood
Dear Indologists,
Can anybody tell me the source and date of the verse "mastsyagandhastu  
tanayo veda vyasa....tasmad jaatirna kaaranam" ?  This verse is used by  some to 
argue that according to Hindu tradition a Brahmin is indeed born  through 
austerities and Brahminhood is not the result of physical birth. 
Thanks in advance.
Regards,
S. Palaniappan
