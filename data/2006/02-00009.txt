Thank you very much for all these swift comments!

It is in an epic portion of the unedited Jaiminiiyasa.mhitaa of the
Brahmaa.ndapuraa.na (about which I shall tell more in Edinburgh).
The context is a long fight between the Kosala king Vasumanas and the
Hehayas kings Bhadrazre.nya and his son Durdama. At the end, Vasumanas is
forced to descent from his chariot because the two others come close to him
(they attack with swords because their bows were already destroyed by
Vasumanas):

>   Could it be the proper name of the hero's chariot?
Allen W. Thrasher, Ph.D., Senior Reference Librarian

I do not think because names for chariot are never given in the text.

Thank you very much. The best solution is indeed that the word means "a
good horse". I find now in S?rensen index of the MBh (s.v.) that Balaahaka
is the name of one of the four horses, and more precisely of one (maybe the
right one) of the two paar.s.ni-vaahas (outside horses), of K.r.s.na's
chariot (with Zaibya, Sugriiva and Meghapu.spa). There must clearly be some
historical link between the latter use of balaahaka as a proper name and
the use of the word in my text (and in the vernacular languages) as a
common name.
What is sure is that it cannot be here seen as a proper name, and Vasumanas
has already lost the four horses of his own chariot because of Bhadraze.nya
:

avaplutya rathAt tUrNaM  hatvAzvAn kosalezvaram |
abhidudrAva vegena  siMhaH siMham ivaujasA ||9.57

I could add that in a previous chapter (and a long time before) Vasumanas
had a "magic" horse (for hunting) who was able to fly (this one has a
proper name which is not Balaahaka; but there is no longer mention of him
in the battle context) :

etasminn eva kAle tu  mRgayArthaM sasainikaH |
tad eva pravivezAgre  rAjA vasumanA vanam ||5.13
yasmai jImUtanAmAnam  azvaratnam anuttamam |

zrIvRkSalakSaNopetaM  sahasrAkSahayopamam |
zubhraM saMbhRtarandhrAGgaM  javenAntaritAnilam ||5.15

Anyway, the use of the word valaahaka with the meaning of "swift horse"
must be a  late/regional one. It is nevertheless worth of notice for the
Sanskrit vocabulary.

[John Brockington tells me that I does not recall this or a similar
expression anywhere in either epic ]
