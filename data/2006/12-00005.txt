BAU or Buddha's life ... which came first?
Dear All,
One of the many problems of dating texts and
events in Indian cultural history concerns the
relative dates of the Brhad-Aranyaka-Upanisad and
the life of the Buddha. The 'traditional' view,
starting from estimates by Max M?ller and others,
would place the old Vedic Upanisads, including
BAU, before the Buddha. Some have argued,
however, that the BAU was composed (finalized?)
after the Buddha (and after Panini). I remember
that Johannes Bronkhorst (The two traditions of
meditation) and Richard Gombrich have written on
this (in the 80s-90s). What are the latest
contributions on this topic in which a student of
mine is interested? 
Thanks,
Jan Houben
