I cannot see the first of these statements in Christian Wedermeyer's 
post. Is this really true ? I am not at all expert in the textual 
history of the Upanis.ads; so I am curious about the date from which 
we can establish their exact text in the detail with which the Pali 
text is established by Buddhaghosa.

In this strong form, the critique seems simply untenable. We have 
translations in Chinese from the late second century which tell us a 
great deal about what Buddhism taught. That is two centuries or so 
before Buddhaghosa. We even have some Gaandhaarii texts apparently 
from the first century A.D. We have inscriptions and sculptures from 
earlier still.

I am myself somewhat sceptical about the detailed stratification of 
the Buddhist texts within the four Nikaayas. But I cannot see any way 
to doubt that texts like Buddhavam.sa & Apadaana are later than 
anything else in the Pali Canon, while texts like the Petavatthu or 
much of the canonical Abhidhamma are later than most of the other 
works in the four Nikaayas. It is very hard to conceive of these 
developments as happening over a short period of time.

We cannot speak of what he knows, only of what he says. Is there any 
king in the history of Buddhism who recommends his subjects to 
practise meditation and attain nirvaa.na ?
