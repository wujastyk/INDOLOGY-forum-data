Tamil Brahmi writing should be recognizable as such -- since it is  
somewhat different from the Indo-Aryan variants.

Another article says

The centrepiece contained Tamil writing in very rudimentary Tamil  
Brahmi, engraved inside an urn. Epigraphists have tentatively read  
the writing as "ka ri a ra va [na] ta."

(see http://www.hindu.com/2005/04/03/stories/2005040301931400.htm)

I don't know what that would mean (in Tamil or Prakrit), but it would  
certainly not be surprising to find an inscription in old Tamil  
Brahmi dating from about 200 BCE.
