I hereby make good on my promise to make available a recording of Prof.
Nagaraja Rao reciting stanzas in a variety of meters:
 
http://home.wlu.edu/~lubint/texts/index.htm
 
There you will find the whole recording (24 MB, uncompressed), plus the
first 2/3 divided into smaller segments.
I also have a similar but shorter recording of S. S. Janaki reciting,
which I will try to get done as well.
