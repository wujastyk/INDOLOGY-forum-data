orphan/orphanage
I wrote a short comment on "anaatha" in the medical context in Roots of 
Ayurveda, 2003 edition, p.13, where the commentator includes the term in a 
list of people who a doctor should not treat.  This includes poor people 
and the anaatha, the "one who has nobody to look after their interests".
