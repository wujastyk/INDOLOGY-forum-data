Several surveys of regional Sanskrit literature are useful on this point,
e.g. K. Kunjunni Raja, The contribution of Kerala to Sanskrit literature,
2nd ed. Madras, 1980 (1st ed. 1958). See the chapter "modern poets" pp.
247-274 (note p. 256 that the Yamapra.naama/sataka by Keralavarman has been
recently published with a commentary by P.R. Pillai, Delhi: New Bharatiya
Book Corp., 2005).
Best,
Christophe VIelle
