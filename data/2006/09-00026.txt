Release of XML SKT morphology
To scholars interested in interoperable Sanskrit computerization.
I have now released my Sanskrit morphology databases in XML format,
conformant to a simple DTD specifying the allowed morphological tags.
Please visit the page http://sanskrit.inria.fr/DATA/XML/ which gives
some explanations.
All comments (and of course error reports) will be gratefully  
appreciated.
