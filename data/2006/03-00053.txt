First, I couldn't swear to it, but I think it is not particularly unusual for Indian Christian women to wear the bindu.  It probably varies from region to region and caste-like group to group.
 
Second, is it necessarily sectarian, in history, for an Indian man to wear a tilak on his forehead?  I think Roberto de Nobili successfully argued against opponents and was supported in Rome, that it was a matter of aesthetics and marking social position, and could therefore be continued by converts to Christianity.  Admittedly, I don't think it's been common more recently.

"It is an Indianised version of a European print of The Holy Family with St 
Anne and the two angels, according to the city art gallery. It has a 
European theme it [in?] a Mughal setting."

I see 2 other figures, one of which could be St Anne and one an 
angel---maybe part of the picture was left off the stamp.
