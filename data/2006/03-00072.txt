Dear Majapahit Folks,
1) "Maja" is the Indonesian name of a large green fruit and "pahit"  
means "bitter" in Indonesian

       a) Bhasa Indonesia Dictionaries do not list maja
2) I have not been able to find easily the botanical name.
3) A photo of the plant can be seen at

4) The fruit can be seen at:

5) Thumb Piano made from the dried rind of the fruit can be seen at:

6) A translation of the Usada Cukildaki with medical uses of Maja is at:

If I find more in the next few days (especially the botanical name) I  
will send it on
John
