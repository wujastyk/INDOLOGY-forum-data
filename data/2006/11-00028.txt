Quotation help sought
Dear Christopher,
Tank you for the additional background information you have provided.  I'll 
follow up the references you suggest.
I would like to double-check with you the following from the version of the 
quote you posted:
1.    In the second pada you have "jana.h".  Is this correct ? Should it not 
be "jina.h"  ?
2.    What are you representing by "asuraa.m/sakaan" in the third pada ?  I 
am not sure what the / represents.
Thanks.
Stephen Hodge
