Subject: Majapahit? Meaning? Derivation?
Message-ID: <161227077646.23782.7359679421042594635.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Learned colleagues:

I'd appreciate it if anyone can enlighten me as to the meaning and 
derivation of "Majapahit," the name of Hindu-Buddhist kingdom of East 
Java c. 13-16th cent. CE.  Seems kind of Sanskritic, but is it?

Many thanks!
