Dear Colleagues:

I am writing to alert you to new opportunities for students at the  
Undergraduate, Masters, and Doctoral levels to study language in  
intensive summer programs abroad.

Languages include elementary, intermediate, and advanced instruction  
in Arabic, Bangla, Hindi, Punjabi, Turkish, and Urdu.

The programs are sponsored by the Bureau of Educational and Cultural  
Affairs of the US State Department working through the Council of  
American Overseas Research Centers.  Program details can be found at  
http://www.caorc.org/ or more specifically at http://www.caorc.org/ 
language/

Successful applicants will have all expenses paid, including air  
fares, room and board, excursions, and so forth.  Please note that  
eligibility is limited to US citizens, but with no restrictions on  
institutional affiliation, discipline, or career path.

Because of the international scope of the Indology list, I realize  
that this announcement will have no bearing for many of you, and for  
that I do apologize; but we seek to advertise as broadly as possible.


All the best,

tony
