Dear Christopher,
Thank you for speedily answering my enquiry. But could you elaborate a 
little on your above comments, as this is not an area with which I am very 
familiar.
That great repository of human knowledge: Wikipedia.  I am trying there to 
correct a misconception that the Buddha emanation of Vishnu is benign with 
respect to the asuras.  People there seem to think that the pauranic 
depiction of the Buddha is flattering to him.
Best wishes,
Stephen Hodge
