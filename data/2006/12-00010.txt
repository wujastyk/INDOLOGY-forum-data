BAU or Buddha's life ... which came first?
Dear Luis,
Thanks, this is an important article. The author
apperently accepts, without questioning, the
classical view that the Vedic Upanisads including
the BAU are (just) before the life and teaching
of the Buddha. See for instance in the concluding
paragraph "The conceptions of life and world in
early Buddhism have thus inherited the
reflections on birth and death found in the old
Upanisads, and further explicated them."
