"From the Vaayuprokta to the Vaayu and Brahmaa.n.da Puraa.nas: Preliminary
remarks towards a critical edition of the vaayuprokta
Brahmaa.n.dapuraa.na", in Koskikallio, P. ed. Epics, khilas and pur??as:

Thereafter, at a second stage, new texts were produced, claiming firstly to
be "supplements" (uttara) to the original B.dP, or, secondly and much more
often, "parts" of a virtual B.d "mahaa-puraa.na" (with various bhaagas or
even sa.mhitaas as in the case of the Skanda). And there are indeed
numerous texts offering such a claim. See thereon my study (forthcoming):
 "Transmission et recr?ation puraa.nique : le cas du Brahmaa.n.dapuraa.na",
in Gerschheimer, G. & Colas, G. eds Transmission des textes en Inde, Paris.
Therefore, the mediaeval and later quotations "from the B.dP" can refer to
many different texts. In the case of yours, which can thus be found in
Madhva, there is the supplementary problem that, according to the
researches of Mesquita, Madhva created himself false quotations for his own
philosophical/theological purposes.

Hoping that in can help,
