Colleagues,
I had forwarded Goerge Thompson's query to the Committee on Research 
Materials on South East Asia (CORMOSEA). Here are some of the initial 
gleanings from their feedback on the manuscript.

Hi David,

With all due respect to Doug's assistant, I'm going to insist that it's
Lanna. I would be interested to see an Old Burmese (scripted) text that
looks anything like this. (And a good explanation as to why anything
this recent would be written in Old Burmese.) That it's in Pali language
and Theravada is certain. Please do let me know if the owner is
seriously interested in identifying the text or needing a transcription.

Best,
Christopher
