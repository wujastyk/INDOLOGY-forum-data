just a footnote, regarding ways of doing this sort of thing conveniently.

I have a mobile phone that contains a 2 megapixel camera.  It isn't even a 
very recent phone (Sony-Ericsson K750i).  But the camera is good enough to 
snap a page of print and produce an image that is as good as a photocopy. 
And in colour.  I can send the picture to my laptop for printing, 
emailing, etc.  It's all very convenient.

Now, if I could only use it in libraries ....

But sorry, Stephen, I don't have Rich's book to hand.
