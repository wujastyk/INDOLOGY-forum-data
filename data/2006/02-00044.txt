"IndoSkript - Eine indische Pal?ographie"
The IndoSkript program is now available for downloading on
http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/~falk/
At the moment, only the Brahmi-related database is included. Kharosthi 
will follow soon.
The database will be updated continously. We would very much like to get 
proposals from users about what needs to be included to fill lacunae.
Only after the first couple of revisions will the context-sensitive 
helpfile [F1] receive an English counterpart.
Please report if you face difficulties while installing.
