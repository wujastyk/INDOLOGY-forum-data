Ancient Buddhist Scrolls from Gandhara
Dear colleagues,
Does anybody have a copy of Salomon's Ancient Buddhist Scrolls from Gandhara 
to hand from which they could scan and send me the edited text of the Dona 
Sutra and its translation ?  I think it would be little more than two pages 
at most.   I would be most grateful for this favour.
Best wishes,
Stephen Hodge
