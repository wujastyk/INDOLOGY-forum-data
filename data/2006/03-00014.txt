Dear stephen,
Vallabhi was the name of the Port in Bhavanagar. Kalunbhar,
Shatrunjayi and Malan are the rivers in and around Bhavnagar. I am
not sure if they have waters flowing now or whether they are dry.
Shatrunjayi is by Shatrunjaya Hill (Palitana). This is just based
on memory associated with the place, and is not substantiated with
any geaographic or historical sources.
