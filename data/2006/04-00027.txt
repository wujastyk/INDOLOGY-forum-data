The term 'neo-Buddhism' is often used to refer to the movement initiated by B. R. Ambedkar, who called on members of his "(ex-)Untouchable" caste to convert to Buddhism as a means of repudiating the caste-ideology implicit in Brahmanically defined Hinduism and of inculcating positive group self-image.  (Hence, it is also called "Ambedkarite Buddhism".)   After considering various traditions, he settled on Buddhism because it seemed theoretically egalitarian, was fully Indian in origin and character, but had the pragmatic advantage that, due to its having died out in India, no longer had any particular regional or social associations that could interfere with its adoption by Maharashtrian Mahars and other low castes.
 
As a point of departure, you might look at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Buddhism .  (Wikipedia articles are often tendentious or polemical on religious topics, but this one seems OK.)
 
Eleanor Zelliot has written a lot on this subject, esp. Maharashtrian Buddhist poets past (Chokhamela) and present ( http://apps.carleton.edu/curricular/history/faculty/facpubs/bibzelliot/ ).
