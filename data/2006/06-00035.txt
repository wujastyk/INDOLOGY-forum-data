Hello,
Some time back, there was an enquiry about recordings of spoken  
Sanskrit etc.I am happy to announce that among my Oxford  
lectures(2005) there is a Sanskrit lecture of more than one hour,  
towards the close of which there is recital of a small poem of mine  
too in Sanskrit.
This can be downloaded from the following site
http://www.ochs.org.uk/publications/multimedia/mp3_downloads.html
It was an extempore class room lecture and probable mistakes may be excused.
All criticisms are welcome.
