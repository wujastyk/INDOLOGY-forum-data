Sanskrit texts written in the 18th, 19th, 20th centuries
Dear Prof Slaje,
Thankyou. This looks exactly like the sort of writer I am interested in. Do
you know where I can acquire this manuscript -is it available online? Is
there a translation or partial translation (into English) available? I am
planning to call into the British Library on the way to the Sanskrit
conference in July - is it available there?
Since time is running out for my thesis do you have any other suggestions of
works that have been translated into English?
Warm wishes,
Jenni

Out of so many (undeservedly) neglected works, I should like to recommend
Bhaskarakantha's (18th century) independent (.i. e. non-commentatorial)
composition "CittaanubodhaZaastra" for a closer study - just if you are
after a witty mind and skilled writer with autonomous ideas. No risk of
entering the ever boring Advaitavedanta mainstream scholasticism.
