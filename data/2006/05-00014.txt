Dear Prof Slaje,

Thankyou. This looks exactly like the sort of writer I am interested in. Do
you know where I can acquire this manuscript -is it available online? Is
there a translation or partial translation (into English) available? I am
planning to call into the British Library on the way to the Sanskrit
conference in July - is it available there?

Since time is running out for my thesis do you have any other suggestions of
works that have been translated into English?

Warm wishes,
Jenni

> I am particularly interested in advaita works, or poetic works,

Out of so many (undeservedly) neglected works, I should like to recommend
Bhaskarakantha's (18th century) independent (.i. e. non-commentatorial)
composition "CittaanubodhaZaastra" for a closer study - just if you are
after a witty mind and skilled writer with autonomous ideas. No risk of
entering the ever boring Advaitavedanta mainstream scholasticism.

Best, WS
