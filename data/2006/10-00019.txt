Research Fellowship in Central Asian Medicin (fwd)
FELLOWSHIP CENTRAL ASIAN MEDICINE
The Wellcome Centre for the History of Medicine at UCL seeks applications
for a three-year research fellowship on any field of the history of Central
Asia and medicine. PhD or an equivalent research degree, and an active
programme of research in Kazak and Uzbek, are required. Remuneration will be
in the range from the low to mid-30,000 pounds sterling, depending on
seniority. The fellowship may be taken up as early as January 2007.  UCL
will be offering language studies in Kazak and Uzbek, and hopes that it
might be possible to raise funds for a longer term academic post. A letter
of application, curriculum vita, and the names of three referees are due by
post or email to Prof. Cook by 17 November 2006. For further information,
please see www.ucl.ac.uk/histmed or contact the Director, Harold J. Cook, at
h.cook at ucl.ac.uk or 210 Euston Rd., London NW1 2BE, UK.
