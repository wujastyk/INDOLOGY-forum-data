'Hindu' stamp
"It is an Indianised version of a European print of The Holy Family with St 
Anne and the two angels, according to the city art gallery. It has a 
European theme it [in?] a Mughal setting."
I see 2 other figures, one of which could be St Anne and one an 
angel---maybe part of the picture was left off the stamp.
