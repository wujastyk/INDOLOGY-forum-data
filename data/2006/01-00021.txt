For those interested .... 
The Telegraph, Calcutta, of 12 January 2006
discusses the reactions of J. Laine on the recent
ban of the new book The Epic of Shivaji
(published a few years back, I think 2001) and
the November 2005 request of Shivaji?s
descendants to the Maharashtra government to get
him arrested through Interpol. See
http://www.telegraphindia.com/archives/archive.html
for 12 January. 
The Maharashtra Times of 10 January showed an
article in Marathi
(http://maharashtratimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1366560.cms)
with an interview with S.S. Bahulkar where the
latter accepts authorship of only limited
sections of the book and denies to be co-author
of the book as a whole although his name appears,
as the interviewer points out, in akshara's of
the same size as J. Laine.
