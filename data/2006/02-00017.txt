>  CHANDIGARH, Feb. 12. ? Unraveling some facts buried in history,  
> experts
> from Archaeological Survey of India said the possibility of a sea link
> between south India and the rest of Asia about 3,800 years ago  
> could not be
> ruled out.
>  Mr Arun Malik, an archaeologist with ASI, Chennai, while throwing  
> light on
> Adichannallur civilisation, said here that the observation of human
> morphological types based on the cranial evidences point to the  
> existence of
> more than one racial and ethnic group in that region during the  
> period of
> the civilisation?s long geo-historic period. ?Occurrences of  
> intermediate
> and pure traits of yellow race of South?east and Far-east Asia and  
> typical
> ethnic and tribal Indians on the external morphology of the skulls  
> and bones
> give credence to the fact that a sea trade may have been there,?  
> said Mr P
> Raghavan, a bio-anthropologist currently assisting ASI, Chennai, in  
> studying
> geo-morphological aspects.
>  Mr Malik said the latest excavations at the Adichanallur?s pre- 
> historic
> site along the coast of Tuticorin in Tamil Nadu have yielded more  
> than 160
> urns, many of which contained hundreds of different-sized  
> potteries. Husk,
> paddy and other cereals have also been found in the urns.
>  He said the people of Adichanallur were agrarian in nature who also
> mastered blacksmithery and made a variety of iron implements.
>  ?The engraved drawings on the clay urns narrate the decoded  
> ecological,
> environmental and cultural significance. For example, a fascinating  
> art
> showing a tall dancing female with a large-sized reptile, probably a
> crocodile, and a member of a deer group explain the pre-historic  
> faunal and
> floral wealth. An incomplete ancient Brahmin Tamil script engraved  
> on inner
> surface of urn is yet to be decoded,? said Mr Malik. On the  
> practice of
> burying their dead, Mr Malik said most of the burials were in  
> association
> with iron and copper metallic objects like swords, knives and bangles.
>  Mr Raghavan said he had identified a unique pre-historic discovery  
> of a
> stillborn baby. ?The foetus is about 3-5 months old, which I found  
> from one
> of the urns. Association of fossilised bird bones and domesticated  
> cattle
> teeth further throw light on the pre-historic domestication of  
> animals,? he
> said.
