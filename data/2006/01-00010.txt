All,
the person to contact at ARCE at AIIS in Delhi (actually in Gurgaon) is Dr. 
Shubha Chaudhury, Director of ARCE. Their website is 
<http://www.archive-india.org/arce_profile.html>, and their location is:

Archive and Research Center for Ethnomusicology
22, Institutional Area
Sector 32
Gurgaon, Haryana
Telephone: 91-124-2381424

I believe Dr. Chaudhury's email is <shubha at arce.ernet.in>.

Best,
David Magier
