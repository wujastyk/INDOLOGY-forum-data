The best person to answer this is probably Prof. Peter Schreiner 
<pesch at indoger.unizh.ch> at Zurich.  He has done major work on the puranas 
in general, and also knows the scholars at the Univ. of GujArat well.

Getting books from India is often an "interesting" process.  D. K. 
Agencies has a quite well-developed website through which one can buy 
books; they can be a bit pricey, but their company is well-run.  The same 
can be said for several other booksellers; see the list of publishers and 
distributors collected at http://indology.info.  Motilal Banarsidass has a 
terrible website, but if you send an email request for a book directly to 
them <mlbd at vsnl.com>, they are often good about posting it out, and they 
can get nearly anything (not only their own publications).

Best,
Dominik
