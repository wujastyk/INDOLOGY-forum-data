The verse you mentioned is perhaps from the Uttara-gita, published by the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Pune. The Critical Edition of the Mahabharata notes a conversation between Kr.s.n.a and Duryodhana in the star passage after 5.92.37, where Kr.s.n.a gives reasons for having meals at Vidura's house:

kaivarti-garbha-sambhuto vyaso nama mahamunih. tapasa brahman.o jatas tasmaj jatir na karan.am.

Dear Indologists,

Can anybody tell me the source and date of the verse "mastsyagandhastu 
tanayo veda vyasa....tasmad jaatirna kaaranam" ?  This verse is used by  some to
argue that according to Hindu tradition a Brahmin is indeed born  through
austerities and Brahminhood is not the result of physical birth.

Thanks in advance.

Regards,
S. Palaniappan
