Source of Brahminhood
The verse you mentioned is perhaps from the Uttara-gita, published by the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Pune. The Critical Edition of the Mahabharata notes a conversation between Kr.s.n.a and Duryodhana in the star passage after 5.92.37, where Kr.s.n.a gives reasons for having meals at Vidura's house:
kaivarti-garbha-sambhuto vyaso nama mahamunih. tapasa brahman.o jatas tasmaj jatir na karan.am.

Source of Brahminhood
Dear Indologists,
Can anybody tell me the source and date of the verse "mastsyagandhastu 
tanayo veda vyasa....tasmad jaatirna kaaranam" ?  This verse is used by  some to
argue that according to Hindu tradition a Brahmin is indeed born  through
austerities and Brahminhood is not the result of physical birth.
Thanks in advance.
Regards,
S. Palaniappan
