Grammar. Philosophy and Epistemology
Dear List,
George Hart's comments about the connection between the connotations of 
Sanskrit words and semantically related terms in other Indic languages 
are well taken, but as far as I can see this issue hinges rather simply 
on Harsha Dehejia's ability to offer concrete textual evidence that 
there is in fact a real semantic split between the roots dRS- and paz-.  
To many of us it is clear that the relationship between these two verbs 
is merely suppletive.  Anyone who would challenge this obvious objection 
is obliged, I would think, to offer some sort of evidence.
I haven't seen any evidence.
