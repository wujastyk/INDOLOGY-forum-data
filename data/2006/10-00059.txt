Dear List,

George Hart's comments about the connection between the connotations of 
Sanskrit words and semantically related terms in other Indic languages 
are well taken, but as far as I can see this issue hinges rather simply 
on Harsha Dehejia's ability to offer concrete textual evidence that 
there is in fact a real semantic split between the roots dRS- and paz-.  
To many of us it is clear that the relationship between these two verbs 
is merely suppletive.  Anyone who would challenge this obvious objection 
is obliged, I would think, to offer some sort of evidence.

I haven't seen any evidence.

George Thompson
