Where trolly stocks (see This Side of Paradise) went in the '20s, and railroad stocks in succeeding generations.

Hmmmm--and where have all the "safe" stocks gone today?

Thus we have the constant reference to "widows and orphans" in the Old 
Testament, and for that matter in modern West (e.g. "widow and orphan 
stocks," meaning very safe ones).

Such is the situation, without the final "n," in several other modern Indian
languages as well. In practical life, "anaatha" must always have had the
greatest potential to be applicable to widows and parentless children. The
contraction of its original wider or literal meaning to these two groups in
society is, therefore, understandable.
