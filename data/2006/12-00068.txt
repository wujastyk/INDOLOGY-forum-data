Tibeto-logical blog of interest
I'm sure most of us have much better things to do than read blogs. 
But there is one that is of perhaps special interest, since it is 
that of the  masterful Tibetologist Dan Martin. If, like me, you find 
pretty much everything he writes illuminating, read on:
This morning he posted what is essentially an article/work in 
progress on Armenians in Tibet, early contacts between Tibet and 
Europe, trade and missionary contact, the Fifth Dalai Lama and 
Christianity, and other points of fascination. I'd like to share the 
URL, and to pass along Dan's wish that any interested readers are 
invited to contribute their insights and information. Although he 
doesn't explicitly say so, maybe this will help contribute to the 
type of collaborative scholarship which our field(s) haven't yet 
really taken advantage of.
