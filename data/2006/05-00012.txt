An 11th century Tibetan translation from Sanskrit refers to a Vajrayaana 
Buddhist guru named Pi.n.do as hailing from Yavadviipa (Tib. ya ba dwii 
pa), which the text seems to equate with Suvar.nadviipa (Tib. gser 
gling).  Elsewhere Pi.n.do is described as being born in "the land in the 
southern ocean."

Sanskrit dictionaries identify Yavadviipa as the island of Java.  I would 
be grateful for any information on this toponym, especially information 
bearing on the history of its use in Sanskrit and its geographic identity.
