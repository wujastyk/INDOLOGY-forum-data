Form of Visnu as guru
The closest Vaishnava parallel to Dakshinamurti is probably Hayagriva,
considered as jnanamurti and Vedamurti and typically depicted with one of
his four hands displaying the jnanamudra and another holding a book (Veda).
He is especially popular in South India, among the Sri Vaishnavas and
Madhvas. I am not aware of any scholarly works specifically on Hayagriva,
but for web sites, see:
