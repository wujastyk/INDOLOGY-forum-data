Burmese palm leaf ms?
Hi,
Looking briefly at this mss, it is not Burmese. It is written in a Tai
script, probably of eastern Shan States in Myanmar or Northern Thailand,
perhaps Tai Khoen. The Pali seems to be an ordination text (sunatu me bhante
sangho, etc). The support is saa paper, known in Burma as "parabaik", which
is very common.
