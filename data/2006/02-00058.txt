travel agency in Pune
Dear colleagues,
A non-academic friend of mine is going to be spending about a week in Pune on business.  Can someone recommend an agency or individual for a day's guided tour of the town and maybe nearby sights?
Also, is Karachiwalla still the place to go there for crafts etc.?
