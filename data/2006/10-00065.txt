kakSIvat in matsya purANa
Dear Indologists,
J. Muir in his "Original Sanskrit texts on the Origin and Progress of the  
Religion and Institutions of India", vol 1, p. 279 is supposed to describe a  
matsya purANa passage with the list of Rg Vedic brAhmaNa RSis including  
kakSIvat. I do not have access to Muir's book. I would appreciate any  
details/reference of the Matsya Purana passage.
Thanks in advance.
Regards,
S. Palaniappan
