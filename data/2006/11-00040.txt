Five characteristics of the student
Thanks------I see the crane stands for attention. These would never be 
applicable
to US school students, since their ability to observe nature has been 
dislocated like everyting else by TV and video games. Some of them do 
develop sharp eyes for software maneuvers.

====================
[Sharp-]eyed like a crow, attentive like a crane, [short-]slept like a dog, 
non-indulgent, and living away from home, these are five characteristics of 
a student.

Sorry to ask but would someone translate what the five characteristics are,
in English?  Is "paying attention" one of them :)
Thanks,
