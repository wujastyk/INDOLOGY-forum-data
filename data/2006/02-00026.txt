cidambaramaahaatmya
Dear friends,
I've recently learned that the Cidambaramaahaatmya, the 
section of the southern Skandapuraa.na that was the subject 
of Professor Kulke's 1970 monograph, has been printed. If 
anyone could share the bibliographical particulars of this 
edition or (even better) a xerox or etext of it with me, I 
would be very obliged.  Please contact me off-list.
Thanks very much,
Whitney Cox
