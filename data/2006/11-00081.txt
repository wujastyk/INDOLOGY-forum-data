Hallo,
By its name the Allaa Upanisad attracts everyone and many of my  
students wished to work on it for MA/M.Phil, but I dissuaded them.I  
agree with Domonik: it does not provide sufficient material for an MA  
study.
The Allaa Upanisad is historically important, but contentwise it does  
not deserve MA/M.Phil sudy.
