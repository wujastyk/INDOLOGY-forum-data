Quotation help sought
Dear colleagues,
Can anybody supply me with a correct transliteration of these verses which 
are supposed to come from the Brahmaa"nga Pura.na ?  I also think there are 
some spelling mistakes here anyway.  The e-version available on-line is 
incomplete, but these lines do not seem to occur in the portion which can be 
searched.  A suggested translation might also be helpful :)
mohanartham danavanam balarupi pathisthitah |
putram tam kalpayamasa mudhabudhir jinah svayam ||
tatah sammohayamasa jinadyana suramsakan |
bhagavan vagbhir ugrabhir ahimsa vacibhir harih ||
Many thanks,
Stephen Hodge
