Grammar. Philosophy and Epistemology
Freinds:
While I respectfully agree with Madhav Despande's grammatical exposition of 
Sanskrit terms pazya and dRz I am not totally convinced that one can totally 
dismiss the connection between grammar and philosophy.
Pazya means to see and drz is vision or insight. Seeing does not 
automatically lead to vision, it requires contemplation.
Sanskrit grammar is naunced with many implications.
