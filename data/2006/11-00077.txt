Hello Dominik,

Did you mean 18th century, not 81 century? (I do it all the time, only saved 
usually by spell-check).
Yes, am aware of the extensive japa-type mantra literature in India and in 
Buddhism. However, the Allopani.sad was allocated to the court of Akbar, and 
so one could assume it also featured somehow in connection with the 
multi-talented munshis he patronized and his multilateral spiritual 
interests. Thus, its chances of being an attemped translation or imitation 
of Sufi dhikr rather than anything found in Hindu or Buddhist collections 
seems pretty good to me. I can imagine that if a Hindu munshi was trying to 
convert something Islamic to Sanskrit he might be following
the example of japa literature, but if a Muslim scholar wrote it, then he'd 
probably be trying his best to retain an "Islamicity" in his text while 
converting a dhikr or a simulated dhikr to Sanskrit.

Best, Joanna
