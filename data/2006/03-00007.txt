Colleagues,

As a number of people have asked more more specifics as to our call 
for papers, I wanted to reiterate that the Yoga Consultation is a 
program unit within the American Academy of Religion, and the current 
call for papers is for panels at the AAR's Annual Meeting in 
Washington, D.C. in November. The previous deadline for submission 
was March 1st, which has been changed to March 7th. Submissions are 
to be done on-line through the OP3 system, which should save time for 
everyone. The call for papers for our unit and the link to the OP3 
system can be found at:

We would highly encourage people "on the fence" to submit a proposal, 
as we are trying to cast the net as wide as possible this year. 
Thanks so much for the enthusiastic response, and we look forward to 
reading the proposals.

Best Wishes,
--
