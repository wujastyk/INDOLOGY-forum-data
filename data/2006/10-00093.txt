It occurred to me that this list might be a way to get in touch with two fellow students of Dr. Raghavan in Madras in 1972-73 when I was there on a Fullbright.  Mainly I was studying Vedanta with T.M.P. Mahadevan, and at that point Dr. Raghavan had "retired."  Two students from Japan, both primarily Buddhist scholars, were doing Vedanta also, but at the same time the three of us were meeting three mornings a week privately on Dr. Raghavan's front porch to do dharmasastra.  The Japanese students were named Watase and Kamimura.  

Information on them would be appreciated.
