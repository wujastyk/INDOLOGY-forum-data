One of the printed catalogues of the Sanskrit works in the 
British Museum (aka British Library) lists an edition of a 
work named Panditasarvasva in Oriya characters:
[Panditasarvasva. A work on Hindu law. Ed. with an Oriya 
translation by Mahendra Deva, Maharaja of Athmallik]. pp. 
372, 8. Cuttack, 1897. 8?
Shelfmark no.: 14038. d. 36 [the compilator of the 
catalogue, i.e. L. D. Barnett, adds: "This is perhaps the 
Panditasarvasva ascribed to Halayudha".]
See L. D. Barnett: A supplementary catalogue of Sanskrit, 
Pali, and Prakrit books in the Library of the British 
Museum. London, 1908, col. 449, s.v. Panditasarvasva
