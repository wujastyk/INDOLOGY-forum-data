Sanskrit texts written in the 18th, 19th, 20th centuries
Hello,
Chattambiswamikal and Srinarayana Guru of Kerala were two great Neo-
Advaitins who wrote a lot. Advaitacintapaddhati of Chattambiswamikal
(Malayalam) and Atmopadesasatakam(Malayalam),Advaitadipika(Malayalam), 
Darsanamala(Sanskrit), Vedantasutram(Sanskrit) etc of the Guru are 
important Advaitic works. Advaitacintapaddhati of Chattambiswamikal 
has been recently translated into Sanskrit.Guru's works have English 
translation by his disciple Natarajaguru.
