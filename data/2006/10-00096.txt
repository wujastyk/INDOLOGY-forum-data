Dear Stephen,

the Dho?a s?tra has since been edited by Mark Allon in:

   Mark Allon, 2001.  Three G?ndh?r? Ekottarik?gama?type s?tras:
   British Library Kharo??h? fragments 12 and 14.  Seattle:
   University of Washington Press. (Gandh?ran Buddhist texts,
   volume 2.)

   http://www.washington.edu/uwpress/search/books/ALLTHR.html

I?ll send you the edited text and the translation (three pages)
offlist later today.

Best wishes,
Stefan
