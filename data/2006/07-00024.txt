Can anyone tell me of a classically attested Skt term for orphanage 
and/or orphan? As far as I can see, the forms cited by 
Monier-Williams in Eng-Skt Dict are not classical Skt., and I have 
been unable to locate a clear example in my perhaps insufficent 
search. (One candidate is anaatha, but I'm not sure it ever clearly 
refers to orphan).

thanks so much!  JAS
