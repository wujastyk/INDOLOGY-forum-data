Jain icon representing the released spirit
Dear Indology members,
could anyone offer info or references to work on the history / symbology / 
ritual use of 'cutout' images (of Jinas I believe) found in jain art?
An example, with the caption "Jain icon representing the released spirit", 
may be seen at:
