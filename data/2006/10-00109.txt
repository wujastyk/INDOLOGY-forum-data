Pre-William Jones Western commentaries on Sanskrit works
Dear colleagues,
In N.V.P. Unithiri, Studies in Kerala Sanskrit Literature, 2004, Calicut
Sanskrit Series 23, in his chapter on "Christian contribution to Sanskrit
literature of Kerala" (pp. 139-140), I read that
* the Jesuit J.E. Hanxleden "well known as Arnos Padiri in Malayalam",
"[who] studied Sanskrit from two Namboodiris from /Sa;nkaraacaarya's
birth-place, Kaala.ti", besides a Sanskrit grammar and a dictionnary (on
which see J.-C. Muller, BEI 1985, pp. 131-134)  as well as r?sum?s of
several Sanskrit works (what I did not know), would also have written "[a]
Latin work on the celebrated rhyming poem Yudhi.s.thiravijaya",
* the Jesuit Paulinus a Sancto Bartholomaeo, "well known as Paulinus
Padiri",  besides his well known works (Sanskrit grammar, etc.), would also
have written "[a] study on Maagha's /Si/supaalavadha mahaakaavya
(Celeberranum poem a Maaga Samscrdanum [sic!])".
If anybody has more information about one or the other of these mysterious
works, possibly lost, I would be happy to hear about it.
