Subject: Critical Edition of Bhagavata Purana

Despite the critics of H. Isaacson (made also in the form of a paper at the
XIIth World Sanskrit Conference held in Helsinki), the recent critical
edition of the BhgP that I have here in my office is a very useful one and
can indeed be purchased through DK Agency or Biblia Impex books.
The general editor is H.G. Shastri, and the four volumes were issued in
Ahmedabad, at the B.J. Institute of Learning and Research in 1996-1998.
(unfortunately I have not the e-mail of Mrs Dr. Bharati K. Shelat who is, I
think, the director of this Institute and could inform us if the volumes
are still available).
Hoping it can help,
Christophe Vielle

I have noted the following publication:

Keshavram Kashiram Shastree (ed.): The BhAgavata
mahApurANa (oldest Devanagari version. - Part 1-2. -
Ahmedabad : Shrimad Vallabh Vishvadharma Samstha, 2002

But I've not seen it yet. My source was a review in:
Journal of the Oriental Institute [Baroda]. 52 (2002), p.
335-336.

If it exists, it does not seem to have found its way into
the libraries. In recent years, some commentaries of the
Bhagavatam have been published; e.g. Vallabhacarya's Sri
Subodhini and that of Anandatirtha (ed. by K. T.
Pandurangi).

Hope it helps
