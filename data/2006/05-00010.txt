Sanskrit texts written in the 18th, 19th, 20th centuries
Greetings,
Can anyone please help me find Sanskrit texts written in the 18th, 19th,
20th centuries. I am particularly interested in advaita works, or poetic
works, but any would be most welcome. I am translating an advaita work
written in the 18th century and would like to compare it with other works
written at that time or later.
Thankyou,
