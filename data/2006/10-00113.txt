Pre-William Jones Western commentaries on Sanskrit works
Thank you very much for this very useful reference, and sorry for having
qualified the Carmelite P.A.S.B. as a Jesuit (as Hanxleden was).
In fact there is one Hanxleden's autograph ms. identified by J.-C. Muller
(BEI 1985, p.  134) in Roma (Biblioteca Nazionale, Ms S. Maria di Scala 17,
from the P.A.S.B. Collection) which bears the title "Yodhisthira", and
which is described as "?pop?e en ?criture grantha". That could be related
to his "Latin work on the celebrated rhyming poem Yudhi.s.thiravijaya"
(maybe a copy of the original work).
Best wishes,
