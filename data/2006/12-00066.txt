INDOLOGY website bookstore
The bookstore on the http://indology.info/books website has been asleep 
for a couple of years.  Amazon has now introduced some new facilities to 
make this kind of thing less labour-intensive, and I've added some new 
references for the last couple of years and 2007 that may be of interest 
to list members.  See the "new" link on the above page.
Best,
Dominik
