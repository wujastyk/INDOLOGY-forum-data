Sanskrit teaching at Cambridge to end
This is truly shocking. And the chair abolished since the time of 
Brough! Who makes such decisions? OIs there anything good that letters 
from outside could accomplish? Anyone in authority who would care about 
the disgrace of a major university in this world abandoning the study of 
Sanskrit?
