orphan/orphanage
The word anaatha occurs in a dvandva with daridra at Brhaspatismrti 
17.11 (cited in Smrticandrikaa, also in DhK Vol. 1 Pt 2) in a sense that 
probably includes orphans but is not limited to them (as you suspected 
originally).  Ashok's comments about the nature of the joint family and 
adoption, at least as presented in dharma texts, make perfect sense to 
me and obviate the need for a distinctive term to represent the sense of 
orphan as a child in need of charitable protection.  It is interesting, 
however, that anaathan is the most common modern Malayalam word for orphan.
