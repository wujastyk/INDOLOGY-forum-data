Help from the experts
I apologise for I thought the diacritics would transfer.
A couple of questions for the experts:
1. I should appreciate it, if some one could help with the rendering of this
passage:
"sobhane hastanakshatre grahasaumye "subhe ravau/
puurvaahne braahma.nair yukta.h pariiksheta vicaksha.na.h//
2. Any information on a sm.rtinibandha: Jaganmohana composed by
"Sriilakshma.naacaarya Bha.t.ta
Many thanks,
Ken
