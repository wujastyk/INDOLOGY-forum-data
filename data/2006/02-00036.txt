Something wrong with the WSC?
Hello,
I am not interfering for or against anyone.
The Gaurava of the PaNCAvayava of the Naiyayikas was pointed out by 
the Advaitins centuries ago.See VedAntaparibhASA of 
DharmarajAdhvarIndra.There, it is clearly argued by the author that 
either of the triads-PratijNA,Hetu,UdAharaNa or UdAharaNa, 
Upanaya,Nigamana will do.His statement is-Vayam Tryavayave 
SthitAH=Advaitins rest on three limbs.
