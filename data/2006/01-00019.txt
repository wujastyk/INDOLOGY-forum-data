Punjabi or Hindustani slurs on British?
Dear Allen,
Your knowledge of Hindi "gros mots" is touchingly innocent! Of course the
British and other enemies would have been called saalaa/saalee (latter
correct vocative, lit. 'brother-in-law'), haraamzaade kahiiM kaa (bastard
from God knows where), bahinchod or maaMchod (sister resp. mother-fucker),
laundebaaz ( bugger). Dafaa ho! "bugger off!
This is all I can think of   for the time being, but there are tons of slurs
out there. Hindi and Panjabi are very rich languages!
Best
