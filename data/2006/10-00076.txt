roots for binding and release in the RV
Good lord! I thought this email was about S&M in the old RV (recreational 
vehicle)
and deleted it before reading. Resembled spam I get occasionally.
Horrors.

Of some use may be an old article of mine:  1993.  "The Changing Grammar of 
Salvation." Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Vols. 
LXXII-LXXIII, pp. 275-294.

roots for binding and release in the RV
Many years ago I began a project that I never completed on these concepts as 
they applied to 1) creation/emission of the world, 2) poetic speech, 3) the 
opening of the atmosphere (antariksa), day, and year in sacrifice, 4) 
Indra's opening of Vala, the cow-stalls, etc. 5) Vrtra's binding, and so on.
The idea, which generated many sheets of examples, was to cover the most 
important roots that named these ideas (vr, ubj, si/sa, bandh, srj, srath, 
muc, dar, etc.), including verbal and nominal forms. The aim is mainly to 
get a sense of the semantics of the ideas but also how they are expressed 
grammatically and syntactically. I'm thinking of finishing the project, but 
am out of date in my knowledge of the literature since around the mid 80's. 
Gonda and Mayrhofer and their generation (and before) I know pretty well. 
After that it is spotty.  Appreciate references and ideas, including post RV 
usage (mainly late vedic and epic). Or maybe somebody already did it?
Thanks!
