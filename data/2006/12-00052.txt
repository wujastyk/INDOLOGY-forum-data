I am curious about the critical edition of Bhaaskara's Brahmasutrabhaa.sya the late J.A.B. van Buitenen was preparing. Emery R. Boose in a review article (IIJ 23) refers to this unpublished critical edition. From the later's remarks, it appears that the edition, based on nine of the eleven known manuscripts, was almost ready. 
 
I would be very much grateful for any information. 
 
Thanking you in advance,
