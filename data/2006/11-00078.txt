yoga tArAvali
Dear Indologists
I was wondering about the provenance of a text attributed to Adi Sankara titled
*yoga tArAvali.*
The only edition of the text that I know of is by TKV Deshikachar and was taught
to him by Krishnamacharya. I wonder if this is one of those texts, like the
*yoga rahasya* that mysteriously appears first with Krishnamacharya.
If the text is something historical, is there any information on which Sankara
was the likely author?
Many thanks in advance!
