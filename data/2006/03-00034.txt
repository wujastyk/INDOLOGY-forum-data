things being absent in a locus (vyatireka). From those particular
observations, both of which are necessary, one derives a vy?pti. I would
suggest that the statement of the vy?pti, given the limitations on
observation, can only be a reasonable proposition, but never a certainty
(ni?caya). For that reason I would take care to avoid using the language
of deduction, because, as I said earlier, such language may raise
expectations that cannot be fulfilled.

There is nothing more I have to say on this. I have stated my reasons
for exercising terminological caution, and nothing anyone has said yet
has shown me that such caution is seriously misleading anyone or
misrepresenting classical Indian inferential schemata. This whole issue
is of such little consequence that there is no obvious point in wasting
further time and bandwidth on it.
