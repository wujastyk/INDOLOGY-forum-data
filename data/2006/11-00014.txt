Uha
Dear Indologists
There is yet another case of the word Uha being used in a technical sense in 
Ayurveda.The Carakasamhita elaborates on this notion and accepts it as a 
seprate means of valid cognition different from inference.The inferential 
process is not strictly followed here.Arriving at a conclusion on the basis 
of several causes is designated as Uha like the prediction of good 
harvest.In Indian Medicine
it is used exclusively for diagnosing diseases.
