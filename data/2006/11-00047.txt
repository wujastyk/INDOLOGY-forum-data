Re: Five characteristics of the student
[Sharp-]eyed like a crow, attentive like a crane, [short-]slept like a dog, 
non-indulgent, and living away from home, these are five characteristics of 
a student.

Re: Five characteristics of the student
Sorry to ask but would someone translate what the five characteristics are,
in English?  Is "paying attention" one of them :)
