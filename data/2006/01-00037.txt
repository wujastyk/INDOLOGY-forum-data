U. Wisconsin Summer Sanskrit
Dear friends,
I'm forwarding the following to the list on behalf of my 
colleague Ethan Kroll.
Best,
Whitney Cox
Dear All:
I ask that you encourage any interested parties to 
consider taking elementary or intermediate Sanskrit at the 
University of Wisconsin-Madison's South Asia Summer Language 
Institute from June 19 to August 11, 2006.
Elementary Sanskrit will provide a knowledge of Sanskrit 
sufficient to permit students to enter any Second-Year 
Sanskrit course in the United States or Europe.  
Intermediate Sanskrit will endow students with the ability 
to enter any Third-Year Sanskrit course in the United States 
or Europe.

Ethan Kroll
