OCLC/WorldCat online for free
What I'd like to know, and please pardon me if I should know but don't:
is there any online library database that lists the titles of book chapters 
and of titles & authors in anthologies?

OCLC/WorldCat online for free
The gigantic online database OCLC's search interface WorldCat is now 
available online free at < http://www.worldcat.org >.  It is an online union 
catalog of thousands of research libraries in North America, Europe, Japan, 
Australia, and elsewhere.  Academics probably have access to it through 
their institution, but this version is available to everyone. This version 
allows a limit command to find the copies nearest to oneself.  See also a 
news release about it at < http://www.oclc.org/news/releases/200632.htm >. 
Another pertinent news release is at < 
http://www.oclc.org/news/releases/200625.htm >, which tells of the agreement 
between OCLC and RLG/RLIN, the other great online union catalog, to merge 
with each other.
