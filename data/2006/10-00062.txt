Grammar. Philosophy and Epistemology
Freinds:
While I cannot offer any textual evience, as I am not a Sanskritist, I am 
convinced that even in the pre-Panini times many, if not all, Sanskrit words 
were semantically and etymologically driven.
Refeences to language in the Rg Veda are very sugestive of this.
Regards.
Harsha.
