I and a few others on this list have been agitating to get Vedic Accents added to the Unicode standard. I received the following email today. 
   
  I'll post more details when I get them.
   
  I'd be interested in finding out if any members of this list or others plan on attending.

Dear Sirs, 

Government of India is very much concerned with the encoding of the Vedic accents in the Unicode. Dr. Om Vikas has proceeded on deputation to Indian Institute of Information Technology & Management, Gwalior (India). 

We are planning to organize a workshop of Vedic/ Sanskrit scholars and all the stake holders to discuss the issues and build consensus wrt to encoding of Vedic accents, in the second week of the April, in Delhi. We hope to evolve some consensus, so that we may proceed further.   

regards,
