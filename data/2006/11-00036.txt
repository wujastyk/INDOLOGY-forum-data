Hatha Yoga Pradipika Commentaries
I think it rather unlikely that the Umaapati who wrote the  
Ha.thapradiipikaa.tippa.na (NCC, vol. II, p.391, column 2) was the  
14th-century "saiva author of the same name.
It seems to me, by the way, that one can one distinguish at least 3  
"saiva authors whose works have been ascribed to the same 14th- 
century figure (introduction to my edition of the Paraakhyatantra,  
pp.cxv--cxix).
Umaapati is simply rather a common name: the NCC distinguishes more  
than 30 of them.
