Subject: Punjabi or Hindustani slurs on British?

This may be a little far-fetched, but I'll throw the idea out there anyway: Could this term have become a swearword through tensions that arise in the encounter (and intermarriage?) bertween a patrilineal Indo-Aryan society and matrilineal tribes (Khasi, Garo, etc.), where the wife's brother would claim to have more authority over his sister than the sister's husband?

Does anybody actually know *why* brother-in-law (actually, wife's
brother) is a swearword?  I have heard different explanations: either
(1) that the speaker is implying that he has had sex with the
addressee's sister or (2) that such a relative is deemed to be a
nuisance because he is liable to turn up, stay for ages and eat all
your food, and you can't throw him out because he's family.
McGregor's Oxford Hindi-English Dictionary offers no explanation;
Hobson-Jobson seems to hint at the former one.
