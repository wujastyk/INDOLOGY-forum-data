Uha
Dear Lars,
Long ago I discussed uuha in my book "Bridge to the Three Holy Cities" 
(Delhi 1985). See the Glossary on p. 498, where I suggested the translation 
"modification of a mantra," and the relevant text (pp. 125-6) and 
translation (p. 371), where the author (Narayana Bhatta) discusses the 
meaning(s) of uuha.
