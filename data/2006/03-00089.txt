Vedic Accents and Unicode
Friends,
I am not in a position to actively participate in such efforts, but I would 
like to draw the attention of those who can to the problem of the underring 
characters. When in a text we have besides Sanskrit e.g. Hindi or Tamil or 
Pali words as well, it would be very nice to distinguish vocalic r and l 
(underring) from retroflex r /l (underdot). But in the present Unicode 
standard (as far as I know) the underring characters are not defined.
