Dear fellow Indologists and Buddhologists,

Anyone interested in showing one's metta and intrinsic mahasattva nature by volunteering for the post of moderator of the world's largest Buddhist Philosophy Forum at e-Sangha (10,000 members, more than 330,000 posts for two years, and growing)?

Here are the rules
