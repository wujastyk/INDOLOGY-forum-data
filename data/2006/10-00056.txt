Perhaps .Rg Veda 10.71.4 is suitable to consider in the current
inquiry.

uta tva.h pa'syan na dadar.sa vaacam uta tva.h 's.r.nvan na
's.r.noti evam/ uto tvasmai tanva.m vi sasre jaayeva patyau'satii
suvaasaa.h//

While the the limited worldly seing "pas'yan" is expressed through
the base "pa'sya" and the more profound spiritual insight is
expressed through the root "d.r's," this might simply be a result
of the specific grammatical forms: present particible and perfect.

Also, one might consider Somaananda's critique (in the second
chapter of the 'Sivad.r.s.ti) of Bhart.rhari's use of term
Pa'syantii to represent the ontological purity of speech on account
of association with dualistic vision.
