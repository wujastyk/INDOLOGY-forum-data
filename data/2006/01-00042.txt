European Scholarship for Jain Studies in India
European Scholarship for Jain Studies in India
(International Summer School for Jain Studies)
The World Council of Jain Academies (WCJA) sponsors annually five students 
or staff members from European Universities which are committed to Jain 
Studies to spend one-two months in India to study or research the Jain 
tradition at the place of its origin. The value of each scholarship is 
?1000.
Students or staff members can either join the International Summer School 
for Jain Studies organized by the North American Chapter of the World 
Council of Jain Academies, which is recommended, or pursue an Independent 
Study Project. Information on the International Summer School for Jain 
Studies can be requested from Professor Cromwell Crawford of the 
University of Hawaii: szabocrawf at aol.com
Suitable candidates will be selected by the Board of the Centre of Jaina 
Studies at SOAS according to their academic merit on the basis of e-mailed 
applications, accompanied by a letter of recommendation by the supervisor 
or head of department, and a CV. 
The money will only be made available to candidates who are studying or 
working at a fully accredited European University, and who can demonstrate 
how the project to be conducted during the study period in India fits into 
their respective degree or teaching programme (e.g. letter of supervisor 
on method of examination).
The awards are granted by the Centre of Jaina Studies at SOAS. They are 
sponsored by the World Council of Jain Academies to promote the academic 
study of Jainism.
Inquiries and applications should be addressed to the Chair of the Centre 
of Jaina Studies at the Department of the Study of Religions of the School 
of Oriental and African Studies, University of London:
