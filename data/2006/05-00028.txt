Form of Visnu as guru
Dattatreya is considered an incarnation of Vishnu as the guru. His 
teachings
are found in the Avadhuta Gita.
Dattatreya is also considered the founder of some of the more important
groups of Swamis in the Dashnami tradition. An American became a swami 
in
that order some decades ago, you might try emailing him for the modern
understanding of Dattatreya as it relates to their order:

Of course, the most famous teaching of Vishnu is the Bhagavad Gita. 
Although
most of the Vishnu incarnations also have teaching in the various 
Puranas.
You might try the Puranic Encyclopedia for references.
It's a huge area. I hope this gives you a place to start.
Best,
Dean
