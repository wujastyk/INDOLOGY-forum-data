A Garuda Purana question
I assume this means 'giving and receiving' are not in Sivadharma. What  about 
the emotional bhakti features such as voice trembling, tears in the eyes,  
horripilation and such? How firm is the date of Sivadharma?
Thanks in advance.

The  first two lines occur with not much variation in the Sivadharma which is
an  ancient (circa 5th century) saiva text and very authoritative one for
saiva  rites and basic conducts of saivas.
In fact quite a good number of  inscriptions of Chola kings from 11th century
mention special endowments  given by these kings for study and expounding of
the Sivadharma in famous  Siva temples.
