It is shocking to note the closing of the Tripos in Sanskrit and Hindi at 
the University of Cambridge (U.K.).

This announcement follows the award of an honorary degree to Dr Manmohan 
Singh, the Prime Minister of India.

South Asian Studies
Undergraduate Programme

General

Our four-year BA Honours degree provides students with the opportunity of 
studying Hindi or Sanskrit or both languages combined, and then to explore 
the literature, history and religion of the subcontinent through an array 
of texts, from the Rigveda to the epics and classical literature, religion 
and philosophy for students of Sanskrit, and from nineteenth-century plays 
to contemporary autobiographies for students of Hindi.

We offer a range of courses, from spoken Hindi to Indian history and 
historiography, from Indian epics to Sanskrit linguistics. Our aim is to 
give students a thorough grounding in their language of choice in the 
first two years and a broad introduction to Indian culture, religion and 
history.

The year abroad gives Hindi students an exciting chance to experience 
day-to-day life in India, improve their language and meet Indian students. 
The final part of the programme involves a wider range of course options, 
the possibility of studying Pali, Prakrit, Urdu, Rajasthani and Bengali, 
and the chance to study subjects more in depth. Students also get the 
chance of writing a dissertation on a topic which particularly interests 
them, using sources in the language they have studied.

On Cowell's death in 1903, his former pupil Cecil Bendall (1856-1906) was 
elected professor of Sanskrit and was made honorary fellow of Caius in 
1905. (Bendall was at also UCL before going to Cambridge.)

Bendall collaborated in research with W. H. D. Rouse (1863-1950), who
