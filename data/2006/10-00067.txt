Dear Sudalaimuthu Palaniappan,

Muir cites Matsya Purana 132 [98-118], and Kaksivat is indeed cited 
there [at 110].  I'm very sorry that I can't send you the whole passage 
on internet.  I don't have scanning equipment, and the passage is too 
long for my sore fingers to type them all in.  I don't see anything of 
much significance here.  It is just a list of names.  But if you need 
the full passage I would be happy to photocopy the relevant pages and 
mail them to you.  If this helps you, just send me your postal address 
off-list.  Or, if you need citation of only a brief passage I could send 
that to you by email. 

Best wishes,

George Thompson
