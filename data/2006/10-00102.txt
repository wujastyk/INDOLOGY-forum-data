Teatise on commentary tradition
Dear colleagues,
Can anybody help me to find any substantial or any at all teatises on Indian commentary tradition, especially related to Kaavya, or mentioning cases when one commentary looks more like a shorter or simplified version of another.
Thank you in advance,
Svetlana Sotskova,
University of Copenhagen.
