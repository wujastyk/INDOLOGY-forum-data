Dear Jenny Cover

You may refer to Sanskrit Writings in Independent India ed by V N Jha 
,Sahitya Academy,New Delhi,India,2003, Dr Thankaswamy's Advaita Vedanta 
Literature-A Bibliographical Survey,University of Madras,1980 and also 
Encyclopeadia of Indian Philosophies Vol 1 (Bibliography)
I think most of the works partaining to this period will be available here.
