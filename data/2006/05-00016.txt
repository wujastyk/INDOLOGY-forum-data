Yavadviipa
The name Yavadvipa was rather well known, but there is some question, 
whether it always referred to Java or, perhaps, to Sumatra. In the 
Greek geography of Claudius Ptolemy (2nd century AD) Iabadiu seems to 
be the latter. The name is explained as "the barley island", so we know 
that it is Yavadvipa in a graecised form.
