Sharada birchbark mss : anyone offered any?
If anyone has been offered for sale or valuation, or seen in a bookseller's catalog, any modern or medieval birchbark manuscripts from Kashmir, could they please contact me off the list?
I should state in advance I am not asking because of any suspicion of theft or national patrimony and export issues, but in helping someone get a basis for appraisal.   I am also not referring to ancient Gandhari birchbark mss or similar items, but solely to much more recent Kashmir mss.
Thanks,
Allen
