A Garuda Purana question
Ashok's remarks make me wonder if this is related in any way to the curious 
term "mleccaacaarya" which occurs (I think) in the Mahaabhaarata. I studied 
this expression many years ago (but never published the results), and I 
don't remember the details off hand. But I could try to dig up my old notes 
if anyone is interested.

Re: A Garuda Purana question
Dear Dr. Palaniappan,
I cannot answer your question regarding the commentators' explanations (I do
not even know if the GMP has any commentators).
Grammar requires that yasmin and yati.h of your passage should be read
respectively as yo 'syaam (= ya.h asyaam = ya.h asyaa.m bhaktau/bhaktyaam)
and yaati.
The passage is important for its liberal outlook. It teaches that even a
mleccha having certain qualities should be treated like a saint, a brahmin
and  God himself (apparently at least a few Hindus followed this valuation;
some Hindu saints are spoken of as disciples of Muslim fakirs or Sufis).
The phrase tasmai deya.m tato graahyam is grammatically two sentence: 'One
should make offerings to him; one should take things from him (without
worrying about pollution etc.?).' While I do not know if it occurs
elsewhere, I would expect it to be an easily formable phrase not having any
special role to play as a unit.
Hope this helps.
