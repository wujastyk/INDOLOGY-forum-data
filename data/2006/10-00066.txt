kakSIvat in matsya purANa
Dear Palaniappan,
Muir gives the passage as Matsya PurANa 
132.98-118. However, in the editions I have here 
(in Skt. and English) the adhyAya is 145 instead of 132.
What I have is:
The MatsyamahApurANam. 1984. New Delhi: Meharchand Lachhmandas.
A Taluqdar of Oudh, trans. [1916] 1980. The 
Matsya Puranam. The Sacred Books of the Hindus, 
ed. B. D. Basu, 17, pts. 1-2. New Delhi: Munshiram Manoharlal.
