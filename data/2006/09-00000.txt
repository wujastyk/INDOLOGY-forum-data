'Treasurer'
Does anyone know of any research that has been done on the figure of 
the seTThi or zreSThin, usually translated as 'Treasurer',  in 
Buddhist texts?  I am particularly interested in the development in 
the Dhammapada commentary, where he in fact seems to function as a 
wealthy banker or money-lender (though without the usual negative 
connotations of the latter), but with almost magical powers over 
money, as a result of kamma/karma in previous lives.
