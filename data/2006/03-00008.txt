Dear Doctor Nair,

I recently saw two of these terms occurring together in the 
Udyogaparvan: 5.139 vs. 53 of the Poona critical edition (in 
the context of Kar.na's response to K.r.s.na's appeal to him 
to witch sides on the eve of the war):

vidyaav.rddhaa vayov.rddhaa.h k.satriyaa.h k.satriyar.sabha |
v.rthaam.rtyu.m na kurviira.ms tvatk.rte madhusuudana ||

A quick search through some electronic texts I have also 
turned up the following, from Maitreyyupani.sad 2.24:

dhanav.rddhaa vayov.rddhaa vidyaav.rddhaas tathaiva ca |
te sarve j~naanav.rddhasya ki.mkaraa.h "si.syaki.mkaraa.h ||

I hope this helps.

Best,
Whitney Cox
