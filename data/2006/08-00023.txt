online library catalogues in Cambridge, UK
A new single online "Universal" catalogue is being introduced in 
Cambridge,
 	http://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/Catalogues/UC_introd.htm
to provide a single finding aid for the various college and departmental 
catalogues that had to be searched separately formerly.
Many of us probably prefer to use COPAC, the union catalogue of the UK, in 
any case as a first point of reference.
