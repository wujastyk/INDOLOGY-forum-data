I haven't any comments directly on this text, but may have an interesting parallel phenomenon.  I have in my collection of small mss of mantras and yantras, a number of yantras which seem to mean nothing in any script I am aware of, but upon further examination turned out to be derived from the Bismillah ("In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful") by successive copying and distortion by people whose sole or primary script was Nagari.
