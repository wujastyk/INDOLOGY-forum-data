Pali Canon Online Database - new resource
This is a wonderful initiativ! Would it be possible to add to the
introductory page a small table giving the numerical codes for the
diacritical characters? Apparently, we have to use the correct diacritic to
search for a word (e.g. vinodetvA with a long a at the end of the word).
Searching with short vowels (vinodetva) the way we can with the online Pali
dictionary doesn't seem to work.
