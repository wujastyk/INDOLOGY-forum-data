Some list members may find the following news item useful, particularly
because of its mention of iron and a Brahmi Tamil inscription ("Brahmin" in
the news item seems to be a typo for Brahmi; it is not clear to me how the
inscription was determined to be Tamil and incomplete if it is not yet
decoded; perhaps "decoded" is to be understood as 'not fully deciphered')
