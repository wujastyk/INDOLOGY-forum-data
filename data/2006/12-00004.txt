The Bharata Itihas Samshokana Mandana in Pune is alive and well; I 
took a group of students there this past summer. It is open 8:30 - 
10:30 and 4-8 daily (somewhat strange hours). The director is Dr. 
Shobhana Gokhale, a wonderful woman who showed the entire collection 
of manuscripts and artefacts to my students.
