Dear Professors:
Pranams! I am looking for this works on Krishnology', on-line, e-mails for contact, etc.
Guy Beck, a well published scholar on Hinduism in general, and on Krishna in particular, has published on the Krishnology of the Vaishnava sect known as the Radha-vallabhaSampradaya. Dr. Beck expounds upon this research in his book Alternative Krishnas: Regional and Vernacular Variations on a Hindu Deity. Through this research he establishes the Krishnology of the Radhavallabha sampradaya.
Tamala Krishna Gosvami, a Hindu studies scholar and Vaishnava guru, elaborated on this term during his research at the University of Cambridge. While a doctoral student, Tamala Krishna Gosvami studied under Dr. Julius J. Lipner and devoted his time to researching the 'Krishnology' of ISKCON's founder.
Sincerily.
Prfr. Horacio Francisco Arganis-Juarez M.A.
Researcher from U A de c; IEFAC; IBCH.
Saltillo. Coah. Northest of Mexico.
