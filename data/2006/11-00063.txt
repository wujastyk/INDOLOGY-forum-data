Subject: Masculinity in Ancient India
Message-ID: <161227078745.23782.5897804252572494028.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Could anyone recommend Indic sources on masculinity, from around 5 BCE 
to 10 CE? I'm particularly interested in notions of the ideal male body 
and what makes one a real man. Are there sources that compare the 
masculinity of brahmans and k.satriyas? And are there non-Buddhist 
sources that discuss the 32 major marks of a mahaapuru.sa, or is this 
unique to Buddhism? Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.
