The Buddha's familiarity with upanisadic ideas
Hallo,
  I now realise that as Gruenendahl pointed out, ChU 8.8.4 contains  
the word anupalabhya.My point is different.ChU 6.2.1 mentions-  
taddhaika aahurasadevedamagra aasiid....Here the asadvaada is, as  
pointed out by  Sankaracharya in his commentary, of the Buddhists. So  
Buddha might have been familiar with Upanisadic ideas.
