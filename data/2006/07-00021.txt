 This book introduces the reader to Western  epistemology in general and some aspects of western philosophy in particular.  The author argues why and how rational traditions of western philosophy yield new concepts and categories for modern contemporary thought, particularly epistemology. He compares the theories of west with the Indian counterpart i.e., Indian rational traditions such as Indian logic, drawn from both Buddhist and Ny?ya philosophies. He coins his own vocabulary for translation and draws his own line of argument. The theories proposed by the author are not only relevant for epistemology but are also intrinsically concerned with scientific methodology. Relationships between these traditions and modern Western philosophy are also explored thereby suggesting how Indian philosophy can engage with contemporary epistemological research.
   
  This is an unique and the ever first effort in the history, I think, that a book in Sanskrit is authored on ?Western Epistemology?. The language and style of the author is simple, marvelous and illustrious. The Scholars and lovers of Sanskrit would beyond any doubt welcome this new entry in the Sanskrit creative literature particularly in philosophy.
