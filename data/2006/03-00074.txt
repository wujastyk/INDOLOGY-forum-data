Dear Colleagues,

Without this posting, perhaps fewer of you than it deserves would become 
aware of the following new publication, covering the full range of 
Indian studies from classical Indology to contemporary issues:

India in Warsaw / Indie w Warszawie, ed. by Danuta Stasik and Anna 
Trynkowska, Elipsa, Warszawa, 2006.  389 pp.  ISBN 83-7151-721-1.

I ought to declare an interest, since Mary and I are among the half 
dozen non-Polish contributors to the volume, which is mainly in English, 
although several articles are in Polish with English summaries.  It 
arises out of a conference held to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of 
the resumption of Indian studies at Warsaw after the Second World War.

Yours

John Brockington
