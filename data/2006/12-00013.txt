BAU or Buddha's life ... which came first?
Dear Professor Houben,
I would recommend your student consult the following passages of
NAKAMURA's important work:
NAKAMURA Hajime. A History of Early Vedanta Philosophy (vol 1). MLBD
(1983) pp.10-16.
This volume is an English translation of Books 1 & 2 of Nakamura's .
The relevant pages in the Japanese Edition are Volume 1 pp.14-23.
NAKAMURA Hajime. "shoki no vEdAnta tetsugaku." [shoki vEdAnta
tetsugakushi vol. 1] . tOkyO: iwanami shoten. 1981
[???. ????????????. [???????????? ; ?1?].
??: ????. 1981 ]
The 1981 Japanese edition of this work contained a substantial
supplement updating the work with further translations, corrections,
explanations and bibliographical material. This material was not
translated in the English edition of this work. Interestingly in light
of the previous discussion, NAKAMURA includes a short article on the
teachings of YajNavalkya as contained in an early Jaina work (the
Isibhasiyaim) - on pages 636-647.
This article and material is not referred to in GOTO Toshifumi's
aforementioned article or in Witzel's recent article:
Witzel, M. "YajNavalkya as Ritualist and Philosopher, and His Personal
Language." in Siamak Adhami (ed). PaitimAna: Essays in Iranian,
Indo-European, and Indian Studies in Honor of Hanns-Peter SCHMIDT.
California: Mazda Publishers (2003) pp.103-143
cf also. Jain, SAgarmal. "RSibhASit: ek adhyayan". [prakRt bhArtI
puSpa: vol 89]. Jaipur: Popular Printers (1988). pp.45-6 (Surendra
Bothar's English translation "Rishibhashit:  A Study. [Prakrit Bharti
Pushpa: vol 90] Jaipur: Popular Printers (1988) pp.34-5).
Another very useful resource is the work by Professor Signe Cohen
(http://religiousstudies.missouri.edu/people/cohen.html) -  in
particular her Doctoral thesis which will soon be published and is
currently available via UMI Microfilms. See her bibliography on her
faculty page for details of excerpted articles and also see the
extract available below:
