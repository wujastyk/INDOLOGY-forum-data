Colophon Date
Greetings,
I am wondering if anyone can help me ascertain if a manuscript colophon date is valid. My knowledge of Indian dates is very limited.
The list of the sixty year names I have is Prabhav, Vibhav, Shukla, Paramoda, Prajapati, Angira, Shrimukha, Bhava, Yuva, Dhatu, Ishwar, Bahudanya, Pramathi, Vikrama, Vrisha, Chitrabhanu, Subhanu, Taran, Prartiva, Vyaya, Sarvajit, Sarvadhari, Virodhi, Vikriti, Khara, Nandana, Vijaya, Jaya, Marmath, Durmikha, Hemalambi, Vilambi, Vikari, Sharvar, Plava, Shubakrit, Shobhana, Krodhi, Vishvavasu, Parabhava, Plavanga, Kilaka, Saumya, Sadharana, Virodhikrita, Paridhavi, Pramadi, Ananda, Rakshasa, Nala, Pingala. Kalayukta, Sitdharti, Raudri, Durmati, Dundubhi, Rudhirodgari, Raktakshi, Krodhana, and Akshaya.
There are 4 manuscripts where the ?aka date given matches the name of the year. These are:
?ake 1711 saumya n?ma sa?vatsare
?ake 1731 ?uklan?ma sa?vatsare
?ake 1754 nandanan?masa?vatsare
?ake 1817 manmathasa?vatsare
Another manuscript however, according to my limited knowledge, doesn't match. It is hard to read, so some of the letters may not be correct.
?ake 1626 vik?tin?masa?vatsare akh??ham?sesittapak?eda?amy?y??ca?drav?sare
According to my list saumya is number 43, so ?ake 1626 would be number 18, which is taran, or t?rana, (not vikriti). Am I missing something here? 
If the year and year-name don't match does that mean that the date is unreliable? (The 6 in 1626 is written differently from the other 6 ? which is what made me suspicious in the first place).
Thankyou,
