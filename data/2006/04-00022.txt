A couple of questions for the experts:
1. I should appreciate it, if some one could help with the rendering of this 
passage:
sobhane hastanakshatre grahasaumye subhe ravau/
purvahne brahma.nair yukta? pariksheta vicaksha.na.h//
2. Any information on a sm.rtinibandha: Jaganmohana composed by 
Srilakshma.nacarya Bha.t.ta
Many thanks,
