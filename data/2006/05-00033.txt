Subject: Form of Visnu as guru
Message-ID: <161227077921.23782.7117222543320939339.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I meant to add that there are also traditions that hold Dattatreya to be an incarnation of Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva combined and also one that holds him to be one of the Seven Rishis.
   
  But the Vishnu incarnation is also quite predominant.
   
  Best,
