Change of URL
=============
John Smith's website, which houses the electronic Mahabharata and a
collection of specialist software and fonts, has moved from its
former URL (http://bombay.oriental.cam.ac.uk). It now occupies a
subdomain of the Indology site:

Please update your bookmarks and any links you may have to the old
site.
The site contains new Unicode Devanagari fonts and substantially improved 
Unicode Roman fonts.
