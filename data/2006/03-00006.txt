Vimzatikaa
In 1989 K Mimaki, M Tachikawa and A Yuyama published photos of the 
only known ms of Vasubandhu's Vimzatikaa. The editio princips was 
published in 1925 by S Levi, on the basis of copies made at his 
request; he did not have access to the original in making his 
edition, although he had seen it in Nepal. All subsequents editions, 
to my knowledge, have copied L, often with conjectural emendations. 
What I am wondering is if there is any published (or unpublished) 
collation of the now published palm-leaf ms.
