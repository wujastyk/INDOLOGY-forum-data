Dear List,

I have become interested in double-accented infinitives in Vedic, e.g., 
?tav?i, from the root i-.  I am unaware of anything more recent on this 
than the old and very brief remarks of Wackernagel, Delbrueck, or Renou.

I would be grateful for references to more recent discussion, if indeed 
there has been any.

Thanks in advance,

George Thompson
