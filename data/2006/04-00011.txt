Double-accented infinitives in Vedic
Dear List,
I have become interested in double-accented infinitives in Vedic, e.g., 
?tav?i, from the root i-.  I am unaware of anything more recent on this 
than the old and very brief remarks of Wackernagel, Delbrueck, or Renou.
I would be grateful for references to more recent discussion, if indeed 
there has been any.
Thanks in advance,
George Thompson
