Yes, I see, this would seem to work. If you copy text into Word, you get the right characters. All you have to do, is to adjust the font choice for each title on the list. CSX+, for instance, gives the wrong characters for titles in German. The weakness of the system is, of course, that you cannot adjust the font for each field in the bibliographic record.
