Form of Visnu as guru
I would disagree with this. Even if the verse is a eulogy on the author's
teacher, it is hardly a coincidence that he chooses to speak of him as
conquering Madhu and Kaitabha, two demons killed by Vishnu as Hayagriva. I
find it quite likely that the author had this particular form in mind, as
it is also the one most naturally associated with a teacher (represented as
displaying the teaching mudra and holding a book, etc).
Interpreting the metaphor to suggest that the guru actually excels the
deity seems to me to be overstating the case, unless it is borne out by the
remaining verses (which I have not seen). It is, after all, not the case in
puranic and other religious lore that 'Vishnu bestows only a lakshmi that
binds one to the world'; on the contrary, Vishnu is said to grant moksha
even to the demons killed by him.
