Hello,
Let me tell you my experience.As I am leftist I find it very difficult  
to get due recognition in my field of Sanskrit, such is the state of  
affairs.All the profundamentalists who were posted at key positions in  
the field of Sanskrit during the last rule, still continue to be  
there.The official team which attended the Edinburgh WSC on the  
expense of the government also made it clear.(I participated in my own  
humble way).
As regards obtaining such books as BP any personal help can be  
extended from my side, be sure.
