Anurddha and the Mallas in the Mahaparinibbana Sutta
Dear members:
In the 6. chapter (6.14, 6.15) of the Mahaparinibbana Sutta, there is an
interesting scene, when the Mallas wish to take the Buddha's body south
of the town, not entering the town and not being able to move it, they
ask Anuruddha for the reason.
He then tells them that the deities wish the Buddha's body be taken to
the north of the town, then through the northern gate into the center of
town, then again by the east gate to the eastern side of the town, where
it should be cremated in the Makuta-bandhana shrine.
I wonder why the northern and eastern side of the town. Is it "only" to
emphasize the difference of the Buddha from other important people (who
are to be cremated on the southern side and whose body should not be
carried into the town)? Or could there be any other reason?
Is anybody aware of any research being done in this area?
Thank you,
Miroslav Rozehnal
