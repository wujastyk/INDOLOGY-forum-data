For the occurrence of the phrase in the Mahabharata please see the
search results of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) version at:

(Please keep in mind that the TEI version has just been loaded and is
the first revision. I am especially grateful to those who have enabled
things to progress so far, but this particular version remains
`work-in-progress'. Suggestions, comments or corrections gratefully
received.)


Best regards,
