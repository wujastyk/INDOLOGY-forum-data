Dear Colleagues,

I am trying to track down the history of this proverbial phrase/ 
cliche ("na bhuuto na bhaviSyati"), which seems to be fairly common  
in epic and puranic literature. As in: "harizcandra-samo raajaa na  
bhuuto na bhaviSyati" (MarkP 8.278cd, DBhP 7.18.52ab). Is this phrase  
attested in Vedic literature at all? smrtis? If anyone has any  
remarks or words of advice, or perhaps even references, I'd be very  
much obliged!

Best regards,

Adheesh
