Dating of the Vaayaviiyasa.mhitaa ?
Ludo Rocher says Hazra concluded that Vaayaviiyasa.mhitaa seems to  have been 
composed in South India between 800-1000AD. (Rocher also cites Hazra's  date 
of 10th century for Garu.da Puraa.na for most of the Puurva ka.n.da.)

The  "Sivapuraa.na's  
Vaayaviiyasa.mhitaa (at least its Dak.sa episode)  would have to be  
dated after this.
