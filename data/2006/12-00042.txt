The Buddha and the Upanishads
Thanks to Lance for reading closely. No, I was not arguing for the 
"strong view." Jonathan, I think, puts it well and succinctly:
This, I would assume, would be the general consensus view in the 
field, which was why I was surprised at intimations to the contrary. 
Given that much the same is true of the Upanisadic corpus as Jonathan 
notes of the corpus of Buddhist aagama-s/nikaaya-s--and given that 
both corpora shows signs of mutual influence--I think Matthew's 
assessment is quite sound; that is:
Thus, one shouldn't (as Tim appears to) take my reservations about 
putting the words of the nikaaya-s in the mouth of Gotama to imply 
that any given Upanisadic passage is necessarily any earlier than any 
given Buddhist passage.
With best regards,

work" to dither around his computer)
