"Studien zur Indologie und Iranistik" (1975-1999) was one of those rare 
journals in German speaking countries focusing on the languages and 
culture of South Asia and Western Iran. It was founded by Albrecht 
Wezler and peer reviewed by O. von Hin?ber, G. Klingenschmitt, H.-P. 
Schmidt and M. Witzel. Its scientific level was consistently high 
throughout the entire period during which it appeared.
After the clusure of the Dr. Inge Wezler Verlag at Reinbek, it seemed as 
if this journal too was destined to fall into disuse. We are happy to 
announce, however, that the Dr. Ute Hempen Verlag at Bremen has agreed 
to undertake the risk of supporting its continuation. With the consent 
of its former chief editor, H. Falk and Th. Oberlies will act as 
editors. The system of peer review will be continued.
We invite all authors to ensure that this relaunch is a success
by sending us articles written in German, French or English. The system 
of peer review will guarantee that articles placed in this journal will 
be recognisable to be of the highest scholarly standard.
Plates are welcome.
Further details can be found on the style sheet which is accessible on 
the homepages of our institutes at Berlin and G?ttingen. Presently, the
