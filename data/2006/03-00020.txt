Name of river in Kathiawar
Dear colleagues,
Thank you to all those who replied on and of list to my hydronyn enquiry --  
and also to my earlier query about the dak.si.naa-patha.
Just one final question for Bindu -- how is the Malan written in devanagari 
?  Does it have long or short "a"s ?
Many thanks,
Stephen Hodge
