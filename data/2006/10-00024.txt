Source of Brahminhood
I have found an almost identical verse in vajrasuuci (23)
kaivartiigarbhasambhuuto  vyaaso naama mahaamuni.h|  
tapasaa braahma.no  jaatastasmaajjaatirakaara.nam||23||
(See _http://www.uwest.edu/sanskritcanon/Sastra/Roman/sastra20.html_ 
(http://www.uwest.edu/sanskritcanon/Sastra/Roman/sastra20.html)  )
Is the presence of such verses in the Hindu texts to be attributed to  
interpolation due to the influence of Buddhism/Jainism?
Thanks in advance.

The  verse you mentioned is perhaps from the Uttara-gita, published by the  
Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Pune. The Critical Edition of the  
Mahabharata notes a conversation between Kr.s.n.a and Duryodhana in the star  
passage after 5.92.37, where Kr.s.n.a gives reasons for having meals at  Vidura's 
house:
kaivarti-garbha-sambhuto vyaso nama mahamunih. tapasa  brahman.o jatas tasmaj 
jatir na karan.am.

Source of  Brahminhood
Dear Indologists,
Can anybody tell me the  source and date of the verse "mastsyagandhastu 
tanayo veda vyasa....tasmad  jaatirna kaaranam" ?  This verse is used by  
some to
argue that  according to Hindu tradition a Brahmin is indeed born   through
austerities and Brahminhood is not the result of physical  birth.
Thanks in advance.
