Having never seen this text before,  may I incautiously (I suppose) write to 
suggest that it looks to me to resemble a dhikr text used by Sufis, or 
imitating such a text, because of the repetition of certain terms/names 
found in the
kalima, and also by virtue alone of sheer repetition. Is that possible?

Best wishes,
Joanna Kirkpatrick

In my view, the Allaa Upanisad, which I happen to have read earlier this
month, does not provide sufficient material for an MA study.  It is short,
and is largely composed of mantras that have a syncretic sound to them.

---------------------------
It begins:

divyaani dhatte dhatte divyaani divyaani dhatte/ dhatta ilala ilale dhatte
dhatta ilale/ dhatta iti dhatte/ ilale varu.no varu.na ilala ilale
varu.na.h/ ilala iti ilale/ varu.no raajaa raajaa varu.no varu.no raajaa/
raajaa punar du.h punar duu raajaa raajaa punar du.h/ punarduriti puna.h
du.h/ hvyaami mitro mitro hvayaami hvayaami mitra.h/ mitra ilaamilaa.m
mitro mitra ilaam/ ilaam ilala ilala ilaam ilaam ilale/ ilala ilaam ilaam
ilala ilala ilaam/

It ends:

sa.m tu.s.ta tu.s.ta sa.m sa.m tu.s.ta/ tu.s.ta devaa devaastu.s.ta
tu.s.ta devaa.h/ devaa iti devaa.h//2//

ilaam ilaam ilaam ilaam ilaam/ ilelaakabarho 'kabarha ilelaakabarho
'kabarha ilelaakabarho 'kabarha ilelaakabarho 'kabarha ilelaakabarho
'kabarha.h/ akabarho 'smy akabarho 'smy akabarho 'smy akabarho 'smy
akabarho 'smi//3//
-------------------------

These quotes already comprise about 20% of the text.


It is included in the book "Unpublished Upanisads" edited by C Kunhan Raja
and published by the Adyar Library in 1938, pp.391-392.  There is a
digital copy freely available in the Digital Library of India,
  http://www.dli.ernet.in

I would say that the Allaa Upanisad is very interesting for the fact of
its existence, rather than for its content.

Best,
Dominik
