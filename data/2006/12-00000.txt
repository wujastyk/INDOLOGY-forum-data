Some years ago a brief work was published in
Jaipur in Hindi, entitled _Islaamii Tantra_.
I don't have immediate access to my copy,
so I can't describe it in detail just now,
but it may be of some interest in this
context, at least as a curiosity.
While I tend to think that the Alla.h-U in
itself does not offer sufficient material
for an MA paper, it might be possible
to construct an adequate context around it.
