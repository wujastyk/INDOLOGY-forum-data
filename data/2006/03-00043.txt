Monotheism (was: Crushing Defeat)
I would not apply the term "theologically correct" to any discussion of 
religion(s) in India. There was no "church" comparable to that in Mexico, 
complete with theological doctrines and institutions.
Buddhism also does not have any one, central hierarchical "church" per se 
from which theological doctrine issues. Therefore, if some villagers or 
non-monastics think and act as if the Buddha were a god, no problem.
Frankly, I find the term "theology" to be not useful in the context of many 
of the world's religions or "spiritual practices."
