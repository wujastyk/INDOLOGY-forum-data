I seem to recall that H. Isaacson, now at Hamburg,
mentioned these editions during a talk at the University
of Chicago at couple of years ago. He might be
able to help.

During the last few years Biblia Impex in Delhi has
succeeded in digging up all sorts of diffcult-to-find
odds and ends I've ordered. They might be worth a
try as well.
