Indonesian "-karta" City Names?
Can anyone help me with the meanings names of the Indonesian cities 
Jakarta, Yogyakarta, Surakarta? 
I have read that _karta_ is "an Old Javanese word meaning 'city,'' and that 
_Jakarta_ comes from _Jaya-karta_," "city of victory."  I am tempted to 
conclude on this uncertain basis that _Yogyakarta_ means something like 
"capable city" and _Surakarta_ "heroic city," given their Sankritic 
appearance, but then I read that _Yogyakarta_ is a simplified form of 
_Ngayogyakarta_ and I'm lost.
Thanks for any insight.
