Dear colleagues:

The South Asia Summer Language Institute serves as a clearing house  
for information about academic summer programs  in South Asian  
languages taught in the US and abroad.

If you run such a program, we would be happy to post a link to your  
website.

Go to:  http://www.wisc.edu/sasli/ and choose "other programs" or go  
directly to:  http://www.wisc.edu/sasli/othersummerprogram.htm

There you will find contact information to have your program listed  
or to set up contact information.

Sincerely,

tony
