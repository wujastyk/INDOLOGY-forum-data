SanskritaPradipika - a Sanskrit e-Tutor
As kindly suggested by Mr. Arlo Griffiths I twice wrote to the e-mail
address for getting a CD of Sanskritapradipika; but each time the mail reply
comes that the mail recipient was rejected by the server. I will be grateful
if someone check the mail ID or if anybody else has also come across such a
problem and if so, suggest me some other way to get the CD.
With thanks,
Ganesan
