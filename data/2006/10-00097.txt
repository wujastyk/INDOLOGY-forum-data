Dr. V. Raghavan students?
Thank you.  We used to play table tennis daily and eat huge beef steaks for a pittance in Madras hotel restaurants.  The three of us attended the first World Sanskrit Conference in Delhi and hiked in the foothills around Ranikhet, visited Sanchi, etc.  I'm sorry we lost touch.  Yes, please give me the address for Watase-sensei (he's obviously achieved great status since I knew him, though I believe he was a priest even then).
Sincerely,
Al Collins
