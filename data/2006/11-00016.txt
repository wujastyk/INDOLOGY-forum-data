I understood that this was "yukti," rather.  The example you give, of the 
seed giving rise to a harvest, is certainly given at Ca.suu.11.23-26 and 
32 while describing the pramaa.na "yukti".  The context is that Caraka is 
giving examples one by one of how each of the four pramaa.nas may be used 
to establish the reality of rebirth.  Yukti here is treated as one of the 
pramaa.nas, although the commentators disagree.  Ernst Prets has written 
on this.  (And I've translated the passage - which is of real interest - 
in my Roots book.)
