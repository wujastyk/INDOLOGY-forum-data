Form of Visnu as guru
Hello Jenni,
     The prime-time form of Visnu as a Guru is that of Krishna as the teacher of Arjuna.  This form, normally called pArthasArathi, is widely worshipped especially in South India.  I typed 'Parthasarathi' on Google image search, and several temple photos showed up.

Form of Visnu as guru
Greetings,
Daksinamurti is the form of Siva as guru. Can anyone please enlighten me
about a form (murti) of Visnu as guru? Is there a particular sampradaya that
worships Visnu in this form? Are there any good books/papers/web-sites etc.
on this subject?
Thankyou,
