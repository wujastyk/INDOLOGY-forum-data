I am not sure if this is a relevant argument. Pazyati belongs to the
conjugation of the verb dRz. This is a suppletive conjugation where the root
dRz handles the aorist, perfect, the future and the absolutive and
infinitive, whereas the present and the imperfect is handled by paz (to be
compared with Latin specio, the s being a "loose" s which comes and goes in
some Indo-European verbs. 

Thus we have pazyati apazyat, but adrAkSIt, dadarza, drakSyati

It is a purely grammatical phenomenon, no conceptual arguments can be drawn
from it.

Best regards,

Lars Martin
