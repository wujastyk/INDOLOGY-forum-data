  this is certainly not true of western tamilnadu where i grew up, in fact (coming from an 'orthodox' vaishnavite family) i was even 'advised' not to go siva temples. no talk about one supreme being, and at times when the local pujari used the word 'bhagawan'  (ofcourse 'perumal' was preferable) he made clear that he meant vishnu and not siva.

  Jan,

I think you have touched on an important issue. I tell my 
undergraduates that, while there are certainly many "gods" in that 
complex family of religious traditions that we have labeled 
"Hinduism," for any given Hindu, there is one and only one supreme 
being. Obviously, if you talk to different Hindus from differing 
theological traditions, you will discover a number of different 
supreme beings (God or Goddess, capital "G"). But if we draw 
conclusions from this about a religion called "Hinduism" we can 
easily be mislead.

All best wishes,

Lance
