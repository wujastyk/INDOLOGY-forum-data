Ulrich Schneider / Vishnus Ausstieg
Dear members of the list!
I am looking for a copy of Ulrich Schneider's "Vishnus Aufstieg", a small
book which we used to have at the university library here in Oslo, but which
has disappeared. Is there a university library in the vicinity of Norway
from which it would be possible to borrow it? I can order it through the
library service, but it would be nice to be able to tell them where to go to
find it.
Best regards,
Lars Martin Fosse
