Is there an online YogaVasishta?/Verse in Vasistha's text
Greetings,
I am wondering if there is a searchable online YogaV?si??ha. 
In particular I need the reference for this verse attributed to a text by V?si??ha.

Does anyone know if this verse is from the YogaV?si??ha?
I would be grateful for any help.
