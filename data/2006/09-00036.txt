Dear John,
Here goes:
The Huntington Archive is invaluable as an online research collection, more 
especially considering that thousands of us scholars do not have the funds 
to travel to all the various museums and foundations that house these arts. 
In addition, no publishing house would print books encompassing such a large 
collection in color, and if they did, nobody could afford it. My work 
benefits from using the archive on many an occasion.
