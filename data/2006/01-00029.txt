Punjabi or Hindustani slurs on British?
Does anybody actually know *why* brother-in-law (actually, wife's 
brother) is a swearword?  I have heard different explanations: either 
(1) that the speaker is implying that he has had sex with the 
addressee's sister or (2) that such a relative is deemed to be a 
nuisance because he is liable to turn up, stay for ages and eat all 
your food, and you can't throw him out because he's family. 
McGregor's Oxford Hindi-English Dictionary offers no explanation; 
Hobson-Jobson seems to hint at the former one.
