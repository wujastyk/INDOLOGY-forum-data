Uha
Dear Lars,
The term "Uha"is chiefly connected with the context of
Prakrti and Vikrti injunctions of the Mimansa.The
injunctions where all subsidiaries are mentioned are
called prakrti and those where all subsidiaries are
not mentioned are called vikrti.There is a
maxim,prakrtivad vikrtih kartavya.This has been quoted
by Kaiyata in his comm.pradipa and borrowed an example
from the Mimansa;a vedic mantra for Agni:
Agnaye tva justam nirvapami.thereafter it is the
statement that one desirous of Brahmavarcasa[Divine
radiance]should offer caru[libation]to Sun.Here the
mantra is modified by making some alterations
i.e.Suryaya in place of Agnaye.
As such,uha should be rendered by
modification.However, its use in Kamasutra may be
understood as the general use of Adhyahara[guess].
