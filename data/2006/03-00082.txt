Leiden Indological Summer School
Dear colleagues,
My apologies for adding another item to the series of announcements  
for summer activities, and a reminder at that. We still have a few  
places open in our Indological Summer School (<http:// 
www.indologicalsummerschool.leidenuniv.nl/>), and would be grateful  
if you could bring the Summer School to your students' attention.
