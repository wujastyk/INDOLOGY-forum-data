It is listed in Boehtlingk's "Indische Spr?che", Vol. 3, 
No. 5848. Literary sources given there are e.g. in 
Canakya-Niti collections referenced as Can. 11 (after 
Haeberlin and Weber), Vrddha-Canakya (after a manuscript 
in Berlin).
A similar verse can be found in Boehtlingk's collection, 
No. 5747:

...(the rest as above)
I am pretty sure that L. Sternbach in his 
Canakya-Niti-text-tradition gives lots of references more.
All the best
