Dear Mathew,
Exactly what passage in Chandogya 8 contains a usage of the verb upa- 
labh?  I don't see it on a quick read nor do I find it in the TITUS  
word list.  I don't see any evidence Buddhist precursors to the ideas  
there either.  The asat of RV 10.129.1 as described by Alfred collins  
certainly implies the idea of anupalabdhi.
Peter
