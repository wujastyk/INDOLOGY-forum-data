Subject: Pali Canon Online Database - new resource

Dear List Members,

An online searchable database of the Pali canon is now available at this
url:
http://www.chaf.lib.latrobe.edu.au/dcd/pali.htm
The advantage of using this version of the Pali canon is that it makes
it easy to search for individual words across all 20,946 pages of Pali
texts input by the Sri Lanka Tripitaka Project and view the contexts in
which they appear.

I have created this resource at La Trobe University, with the permission
of the Journal of Buddhist Ethics and the Sri Lanka Tripitaka Project,
on the basis of the files currently on the JBE site. 

I hope this will be a useful resource for those studying Pali and the
Pali canon.

Peter Friedlander
