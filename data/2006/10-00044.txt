Indian epistemic terms
Friends:
An important concept that is overlooked by epistemologists is that of 
DRISHTI or visual knowledge.
While PASHYATI is a verb there is no verb like DRASHYATI. This is  the 
beginning of an inquiry into visual knowledge.
I am trying to develop this concept further.
Regareds.
