Online Rigveda (fwd)
The Online Rigveda text is wonderful and provides easy access.  I wish someone working on this excellent website would provide the traditional received text of the RV side by side with the reconstructed text for easy comparison.

Online Rigveda
The Linguistics Research Center at the University of Texas at Austin has 
recently added a revision of van Nooten and Holland's metrically restored 
edition of the text of the Rigveda to its online resources, at 
http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/RV/index.html - a joint project 
undertaken by Karen Thomson and Jonathan Slocum, with the encouragement of 
Professor Winfred Lehmann of the Center.
Van Nooten and Holland's edition, in making clear for the first time the 
original poetic form and linguistic style of the Rigveda, constituted a 
watershed in Rigvedic scholarship, but the book has been out of print for 
a number of years. The primary purpose of the Texas online edition is to 
make van Nooten and Holland's restored text generally accessible, and in a 
form that is easy to read. In addition, in doing so we hope to facilitate 
its further improvement and correction by scholars, and very much welcome 
all comments and contributions to this end.
