Commercial Nagari font? (fwd)
Dear Prof. Hanneder:
I would suggest that as a first step you consult the resource guide  
on fonts at the South Asia Language Resource Center, a collaborative  
effort of the US Department of Education's Title VI National Resource  
Centers for South Asia.  The SALRC is located at the University of  
Chicago.
See:  http://salrc.uchicago.edu/
The font section is listed under "resources"":  http:// 
salrc.uchicago.edu/resources/fonts/
Cheers,
tony
