NGMCP Newsletter, No. 2
Dear Professor Zysk,
I will send you the light version in a separate mail.
Also, if other people had difficulty downloading the newsletter,  
please send a personal note to me.  I will send the newsletter  
directly to them.
Nonetheless, the newsletter _should_ download fine by now.
All the Best,
kengo
