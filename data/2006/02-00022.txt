Commercial Nagari font?
Dear Colleagues,
can anyone recommend high quality Devanagari fonts for Sanskrit.
I think that I have probably seen most of the free Nagari fonts
available and I am of course aware that some of them are quite
good. And, of course, looking at the glyph table of some of the
commercial fonts is slightly disappointing, but I have not yet given
up hope for more professional tools for printing. 
Kind regards
