bIbhatsa rasa
B. K?lver has some very interesting remarks on this in:
Zur Fruehgeschichte der Rasa-Lehre, Berliner Indologische Studien,  
Vol. 6 (1991).
See especially ?4 pp. 26--29, where he evaluates N"S 6.39 biibhatsaac  
ca bhayaanaka.h and finds the common translation of biibhatsa-  
(desid. of baadh) as 'repugnant, repellent' etc. too narrow and often  
misleading.
