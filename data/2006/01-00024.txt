bIbhatsa rasa
Dear Colleagues,
I am wondering if anyone might be able to provide references on  
scholarly studies of the bIbhatsa rasa in Skt drama and poetics. I am  
particularly interested in discussions of genre--why (and when and by  
whom) this and certain other rasas were sometimes considered  
inappropriate to be represented on stage.
Thanks and best regards
