Dear list members,

 

I am seeking information regarding research visits to the Maharashtra
State Archives at Elphinstone College in Mumbai and the Bharat Itihas
Samshodak Mandal in Pune. Should I be prepared with any particular
papers or should I expect any difficulties? I was told recently that the
Bharat Itihas Samshodak Mandal may have closed down. Is this the case?

 

Thanks in advance
