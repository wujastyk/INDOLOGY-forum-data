Name of Tibet
The _Vimalaprabhaa_ (early 11th cent.) commentary on the Kaalacakra tantra 
refers to Tibet in a list of countries: ...bo.ta lii ca 
ciinaadide'sesu...sambhalavi.sayaantam... (sic. best MS).  (_lii_ appears 
to be a transcription of the Tibetan name _li_ for Khotan.)  See John 
Newman, "It1neraries to Sambhala" in Jose Cabezon and Roger Jackson 
(eds.), _Tibetan Literature_ (Ithaca, NY: Snow Lion, 1996) p. 494, n. 9 &amp; 
10.  It is likely that the author of the _Vimalaprabhaa_ had contact with 
Tibetans.
