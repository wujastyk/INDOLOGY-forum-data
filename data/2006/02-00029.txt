Dear Colleagues,
I phoned Prof. Pollet, and he told me that the thesis remained not
published, but must be available for free copy at the SOAS. It includes a
critical edition, a translation and a commentary of the Bhaktamaala.
May I add this last reference by the same:
"Vai.s.nava Sacred Places: References in the Bhaktamaala of Naabhaadaas",
in Orientalia Lovaniensia Periodica 31, 2005, pp. 119-122.
