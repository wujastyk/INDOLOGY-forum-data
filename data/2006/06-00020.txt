Pa.n.ditasarvasva
Dear Axel,
That must be it then: which edition do you dispose of? I don't find  
anything as yet in our catalogs, but maybe I'm searching in the wrong  
way. I don't find a reference to a published text on p. xl of the  
Introduction of Durgamohan Bhattacharyya's 1960 ed. of the  
Braahma.nasarvasva by the same author, but maybe an edition has  
appeared by now?
Best,
Arlo
