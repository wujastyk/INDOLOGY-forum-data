an interesting Mahabharata ms
The Library of Congress has bought two minuscule script Bhagavatapurana scrolls, one from Sam Fogg (ex-Newberry Library) and another from an American private person.  
Some art historian, it may have been Vidya Dehejia, told me that these scrolls were particularly characteristic of Alwar.
Ours are not on silk but on paper, in one case backed by silk (probably by Newberry).  The style is to my amateur eyes not dissimilar to the Edinburgh one, but our ills.  take up a smaller fraction of the width of the scroll than yours appear to.  How wide is yours?
