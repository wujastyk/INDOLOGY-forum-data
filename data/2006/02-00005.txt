aaruroha valaahakam
Could it be the proper name of the hero's chariot?

Dear colleagues,
at the end of a long fight, the hero has lost all his weapons and is forced
to flee from the battle-field. The text says:
chinnadhanvaa vasumanaa viniv.rttara.nodyamaH |
vegena mahataa raajann aaruroha valaahakam ||
va- or balaahaka according to MW has several meanings: "a rain or
thunder-cloud", "any cloud" MBh. Kaav. [cf. Kaalidaasa, KS 1,4]; one of the
7 clouds appearing at the destruction of the word, Cat. [where?]; [N. of ]
a mountain, L. [cf. Somadeva Kathaas.]; [and among various other proper
names] N. of one of the 4 horses of Vish.nu, Kaad.
Could the expression vegena valaahakam aa-RUH "ascend the Valaahaka
(cloud?) swiftly" mean something as "to bold", "to skedaddle" (in French,
"prendre la poudre d'escampette"). Has somebody already found that
expression in epic context?
