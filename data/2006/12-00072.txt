The "Digital Sanskrit Buddhist Canon" site 
(http://www.uwest.edu/sanskritcanon/index.html) seems to 
be preparing an online version, but it is not available at 
this moment (go to "download", "Sutra"; Satasahasrika 
appears in the list, but it is not clickable).
By the way, Edward Conze gives some references to 
mAyA-puruSa in his _Materials for a dictionary the 
Praj?ApAramitA literature_ / by Edward Conze. - Tokyo : 
Suzuki Research foundation, 1967, p. 320, s.v.
According to Conze, there are passages in the 
Astasahasrika, Pa?cavimsatisahasrika and Saptasatika (one 
of the Pa?cavimsati- references seems to correspond to the 
Satasahasrika).
Hope it helps
