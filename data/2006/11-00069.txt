The text does not give references to manuscripts or 
variant readings, so it is not what I would call a 
critical edition. By the way, here this Upanishad belongs 
to the group of Shakta-Upanishads.
In 1996, a question concerning this text already came up 
here in this mailing list. I pointed to a manuscript 
catalogue of F. O. Schrader who made a few remarks on the 
Alla(h)-Upanishad, see http://tinyurl.com/ybvq6t
For whatever it is worth, Google Books 
(http://books.google.com) gives some references if you 
look for "Allah Upanishad".
Hope it helps
