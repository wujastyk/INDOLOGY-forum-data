Indology in Berlin
Many thanks to Haru Isaacson for transmitting the message of Dr.s Strauch and
Dreyer.
We had begun to discuss the situation on our intl. Pan-Asian list
(Indo-Eurasian-Research, more than 700 members from 30 disciplines).
<http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Indo-Eurasian_research/message/5607>
and have been preparing an international write-in to the Berlin authorities.
* Please see my next message for details.*
It is essential that as many of us as possible participate in this effort, so
that at least some sections of Berlin Indology at Freie Univertsitaet and
Humboldt Universitaet be saved.
Best,
M. Witzel
