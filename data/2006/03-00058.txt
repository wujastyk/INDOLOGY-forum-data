There is a detailed summary of all arguments regarding this question in Jon Yamashita's (unpublished) thesis on the Chapter on Grammar of the Sarvadar"sanasa.mgraha.

Jon M. Yamashita, A Translation and Study of the Paa.ninidar"sana Chapter of the Sarvadar"sanasa.mgraha. A Dissertation in Asian and Middle Eastern Studies Presented to the Faculties of the University of Pennsylvania in Partial Fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, Ann Arbor, Michigan, UMI Dissertation Services, 1998.

Hope this helps.
Best,

Pascale Haag.

K. Klostermaier's trans. of ch. 16 of the Sarvadars'anasa.mgraha
(Adyar 1999), K. Kunjunni Raja affirms the argument of Ananthalal
Thakur (that appeared in the Adyar Library Bull. vol. 25) 
that one Cannu Bha.t.ta and not Saaya.na Maadhava was the
real author of the SDS. Do any of the kind
readers of the list know of additional critical
discussion of this re-attribution, or have any further information
to bring to bear upon the question?
