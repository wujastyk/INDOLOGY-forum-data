Anurddha and the Mallas in the Mahaparinibbana Sutta
The different directions are ruled by deities called
Dikpalas. South is ruled by Yama the god of death.
Those who are destined for rebirth are under his
influence. The East is ruled by Indra and the North by
Kuvera and are considered auspicious. Perhaps these
directions were chosen because the Buddha was freed
from rebirth.
