Dear Colleagues,
Please, do not ignore either what was published in the WZKS' most recent
volume about the 'historical worth' of the Tipi.taka and related texts:
Alexander Wynne, The Historical Authenticity of Early Buddhist Literature. A
Critical Evaluation. WZKS 49 (2005[06]) 35-70.
With best wishes

Betreff: Re: The Buddha and the Upanishads

This is neither the time nor the place to reopen the very complicated 
debates about what we can know of early Buddhism in general. But one 
small reminder might be in order a propos a recent comment.

Tim Lubin wrote, in referring to some remarks of Christian Wedemeyer:

This is not so. Not only do we now have Gandhari materials some of 
which may contain not only contents but may actually be physically 
significantly older than Buddhaghosa, but we have long had Chinese 
materials which significantly predate him as well. There are, to be 
sure, some significant challenges in dealing with this material, but 
in terms of confirming (otherwise later) Indic language materials, at 
the very least, they cannot and should not be ignored.
