For anyone who uses a Macintosh, and would like to have all the  
conjuncts necessary for Sanskrit readily available to the Devanagari- 
QWERTY keyboard, I have a nicely tweaked Devanagari MT font that  
serves this purpose very well.  It is free for anyone who would like  
it: if you want a copy, please email me with "devanagari font" in the  
title, and I'll send it to you.
