Five characteristics of the student
Dear Indologists,
My 'grandfather' in Orissa once quoted to me a small verse of which I  
remember only one half of an uneven paada plus the final paada:
... bakadhyaayii ... vidyaarthipa;ncalak.sa.nam
Reading Manu 7.106 reminds me of it. I tried googling to fill in the  
blanks, but to no avail. Can anyone help me restore my poor memory?
Best wishes,
