Hi,
This is to announce a new resource for those of you interested in books from
India. Chetana, as some of you might already know, is a bookshop in Bombay
that has, for the last 50 years specialised in books on Vedanta and Indian
Philosophy.

Now Chetana has its own website at http://www.chetana.com. Do browse our
site and let us know what you think of it. Founded by S.Dikshit, himself a
serious student of Vedanta, Chetana is better known the publisher of "I Am
That" - the dialogues with Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj, a contemporary sage.

Please feel free to criticise us - since we are trying to create a quality
resource for your use.

With regards,
Kavi Arya (kavi at chetana.com)
Director, Chetana Pvt. Ltd.
