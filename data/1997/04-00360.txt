Sailendra is one of the names of Siva. Parvati is known as Sailenra 
Dhanaya,or Sailendri.
But in history, the Sailendras were a powerful dynasty who ruled over the 
Malay Archipelago- (Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, Java,and few thousand more 
islands).The region was known at one time,as the Sri Vijaya Empire. The 
Sailendra emperors held sway for over six hundred years. They were known 
as the "Kings of the Mountains" for a reason.The Pandyas of Tamilnadu 
were also known as" Saila raja"s.They were better known as "Malayan"s. 
The mainland part of the Sri Vijaya Empire was known as 
"Malaya".It is known still by the same name.Kings of 
"Malaya"-"Sailendra"s. The Khmer Emperors also were known by a similar 
name for a similar reason. After all,the" Phnom" in" Phnom Phen" also 
means a mountain.
"Silendro"is a derivative of the" Sailendra".The Sailendras had a close 
affinity with East Java.
