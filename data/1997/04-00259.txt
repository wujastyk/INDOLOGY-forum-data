I'm afraid I did not convey my point clearly: I did *not* suggest that
the presence of the metaphor in Semitic would mean that Semitic would
be the source of the Vedic metaphor.

Semitic is simply one a place to look for it, which would not be Indic.
If you don't like Semitic try Polynesian, or Quechua, or Chukchi-Kamcha-
dal. "Semitic" is not important. Replace "Semitic" with "any language
(family) outside India" if you wish.

The reason one might want to look around is that, *if* that metaphor is
found in contexts other than Indic it could simply mean that this is a
natural metaphor.

This in turn *might* imply that its presence in both Vedic and Tamil
might be due to independent development rather than to mutual influence.

Incidentally, I'd never meant to get involved in this discussion. I was
merely reacting to yet another claim that "Western Scolarship (tm)" was
trying to take something away which ought to be credited to India. At
least in this specific instance, this wasn't the case, because, at the
risk of repeating myself, the purpose of the inquiry was *not* to find
a Semitic or any other outside source for the Vedic metaphor, but to
verify whether Tamil and Vedic could not have originated that metaphor
independently (*and* independently of *any* outside source, Semitic or
other)
