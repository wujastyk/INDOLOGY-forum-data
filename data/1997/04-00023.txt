Other festivals, too.
The recent question about the date Mahashivaratri is now celebrated
reminds me that I have been meaning to ask if someone could give a
difinitive date for when the new year begins in Tamilnad. Is it, as one of
my friends claims, ALWAYS on April 14th?  Ie. a fixed calendrical date?
And THAT date in particular?  Is there not (as there is in Karnataka)
several different New Year dates, depending on the tradition ones
community follows?
