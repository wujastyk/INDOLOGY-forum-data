I am afraid that I cannot give you an exact reference, but there is at least
one such book, written, I believe, by a Greek author. This may not be very
helpful, but at least you should keep looking.>>
The book you are referring to may be Hindu Epics, Myths and Legends in
Popular Illustrations by Vassilis G. Vitsaxis. It is a retelling of several
Indian myths illustrated by popular contemporary posters.
