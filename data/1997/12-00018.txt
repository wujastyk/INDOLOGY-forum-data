Nepal-German Manuscript Preservation Project
As one of the former Directors of the NGMPP I can only confirm what
Michaels Witzel wrote about the situation. The agreement between H.M.G.
Nepal and the German Oriental Society was and is for the copy right of
their (!) texts and for the (financial) benefit of Nepal that microfilm
copies have to be ordered directly from the National Archives.
However, to quicken the procedure one can send the order to the NGMPP
office in Kathmandu (present director: Dr. Klaus-Dieter Mathes), P.O.Box
180, Kathmandu, who will look after it. Usually it does not take more
than a few days to receive a copy in Nepal since the staff is well
trained and very cooperative. The rest of the procedure depends
on money transfer and mail service (Getting a microfilm copy from
Cambridge University Library took me two months recently.)
That's it. There are no nationalistic ambitions in it. The NRC and the
NGMPP has always been an international institution with no nationalistic
restrictions at all. Microfilms are available for anybody in the world,
but if the Nepalese side wants to reserve the copy right, one has to
respect it. Such are politics.
However one could think of an addition tothe agreement that copies can be
ordered from Berlin if it is guaranteed that Nepal will get what she
would get if the microfilms were send from the National Archives. I don't
think that the Nepalese side would object it.
I shall send a copy of this e-mail to Prof. Wezler.
Best wishes, Axel Michaels
