             Tamil related Websites
            ************************

Here are some of the websites for the Tamil magazines around the world.
Many more exist. For classical Tamil texts, University of Koeln has
a website. One time, Dr. Gary Hausman asked me the website for
Kumutham magazine, the largest selling weekly in India. Here it is.

Hope one day, a database with article titles, author, etc., in 
Tamil archival magazines like Kalaimakal from 1930s,
Senthamizh, Senthamizh Selvi, Tamizhp Pozhil of Karanthai Tamil Sangam,
Amudha Surabi, Pongal & Deepavali souvneirs, Tamil ChuDar sections of
Dinamani is created and available on-line.

I believe, for no Indian language, a bibliography on
articles in quality journals is available in print also.
It will be enormous help for researchers. There is plenty of
bibliographical help for India related materials in English
and good amount on books in Indian languages. But, almost none
on Indian language quality journals! Hope the librarians, South Asia
studies depts., the funding groups take a look at this.
