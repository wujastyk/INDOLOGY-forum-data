  In addition to the papers already mentioned, I think that it would be 
really worthwhile looking at the following book:
"Was the Ramayana copied from Homer?:A reply to Professor Weber"
by Kashinath T Telang. Publisher:Publishers Parlour
DElhi, 1976
This refutes Dr WEbers( a prof at the university of Berlin) claim
that the Valmiki plagiarised Homers writings. This is arguably the 
oldest comparitive book on this topic...(K.T.Telang passed away in
1893).
