On leave
Dear colleagues,
I will be on research leave until January, 1998. During this period I can
be reached at my usual mailing, fax  and email addresses, however I will
not be available at my usual telephone number.
During this period I will also discontinue my subscription to this list. I
look forward to rejoining it in January.
With best wishes,
Ruth Schmidt
