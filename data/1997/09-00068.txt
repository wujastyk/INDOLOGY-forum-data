Dravidian Cryptography
As one who has studied from Tamil Sangam literature onwards reasonably well
for about 30 years, I want to say that the phenomenon of "inversion/cryptical"
in Tamil is not common at all. May be for some
onomatopoeic words. That's all.
Kannada "hengasu" is from the Old Kannada "peNgasu".
1000s of words of modern Kannada have transformed "p" into "h".
