Dear Colleagues,

_sindhu_ meant not only the River Indus, but "river" in general, and "sea".
It is retained in Shina as _sin_, "river" (from *_sind_, which has been
borrowed into Burushaski as _sende_). Checking in Turner's _Dictionary of
the Indo-Aryan Languages_, I can not find it with any other meanings except
	river
	Indus river
	ocean
	province of Sindh
Perhaps an Iranianist can elucidate.

With best wishes,

Ruth Schmidt
