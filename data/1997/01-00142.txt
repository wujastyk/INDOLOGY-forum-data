Dear Indologists,

Yes, this mail comes from the same person who is being 
considered as the one who is trying to convert INDOLOGY 
into a commercial place. I will respond to this topic on 
a later date. 

Right now I want a suggestion from all my friends on Indology 
on a topic which is more of a personal nature: 

Most of you are already aware that my name is Surya Prakash 
(Sun Light). And my wife's name is Monika (very European name 
indeed). We were blessed with a lovely daughter on 25th Dec. 
(Santa's gift on X-Mas 1996).  We are finding it a little 
difficult to finalise her name as we are looking for an 
Indic baby name with some link to "Surya".  An option that 
I have is "ARUNIMA" (pronounced arunimA). Can INDOLOGISTS 
suggest a few options ? 

Please excuse me for using INDOLOGY once again for personal
interests!

Regards,
Surya P. Mittal
