Translations of Sangam-Poems
To everybody who is interested in Tamil Sangam-Literature:
You will find an Index of Translations of individual Sangam-poems in the
WWW under
http://members.aol.com/ilakkiyam/sangam/index.htm
The page is under construction, hence: not yet very easily to be used.
But all the information gathered so far is already on the site.
A first updating will be carried out in December.
Greetings, ULRIKE
