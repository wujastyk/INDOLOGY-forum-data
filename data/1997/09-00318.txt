Indian religious art
        I would just like to express my great thanks to the many people
who have responded to my query concerning popular Indian religious art. As
several persons have expressed an interest, when I have had the
opportunity to examine these materials, I will post a bibliography on the
subject to Indology. Thanks,
                                        Kristen Hardy
