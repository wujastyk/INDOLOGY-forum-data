Translations of Tamil names into Sanskrit
	Indeed I come from Pu.yapattana or Pu.nyanagarii (= Pune, pu.ne in
Marathi). I don't know how old this usage is, but it is commonly seen not
only in modern Sanskrit publications from Pune, but often also in Marathi. 
The old pre-urbanization name of this place was punava.dii.
