delocutives [was Graha epithets (tArA,tArakA and tAraka)]
In response to Jonathan Silk's post:
Consider other examples: in French one can 'tutoyer' and 'vouvoyer' ['to
address as *tu* or *vous*'], and in German one can 'duzen' ['address as
*du*']. Etc.[lots more examples can be found in Benveniste].
Clearly, delocutive verbs are formed from discourse conventions, not from
the language's regular morphological system.
This is a fairly productive feature of Sanskrit, as it turns out, though I
don't recall that Benveniste cites any Skt examples. I have argued in JAOS
117.1 that the term ahaMkAra is a delocutive term meaning 'the utterance,
or cry, *aham*' [van Buitenen had essentially made the same observation a
long time ago]. Vedic ritual utterances like 'oMkAra, vaSaTkAra,
svAhAkAra', etc., are not derived in the same way as 'kumbhakAra'
['potter'] is. They are derived from discourse conventions: they are
therefore delocutives.
Consider also non-Vedic terms like 'asmitA' and 'asmimAna', both of which
mean something like 'egotism, self-conceit', but which seem clearly to
refer to the activity of saying "I am" a bit too much....
Renou was aware of the term 'de'locutif' and cited a few more examples
soemwhere, I think, in EVP. Debrunner also. Likewise Szemere'nyi. I don't
have access to the too-expensive volumes of Wackernagel-Debrunner, but I'd
be surprised if there is no discussion there.
Thank you, Dominique, for raising interesting issues,
