>?From Muneo Tokunaga,

Does anyone tell me why Scheftelowitz uses I. in
some of his works and J. in others as the
initial of his personal name?

After handing the draft of a new critical edition of the
BRhaddevatA to the publisher, I am still annoyed by
this question. Sounds funny? but serious to me to make
the description in Bibliography perfect.

Thank you in advance.
