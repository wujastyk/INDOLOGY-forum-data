History or Myth? Was: Black Draupadi?
Putting these two questions together is like walking into the same trap
Martin Bernal set for himself with his Black Athena. The first question is
an historical question for which there is no historical answer. The second
question is a literary question for which the text gives all the answer we
deserve.  Mixing these questions up can only reiterate silliness, of
which scholars have produced too much already for over a century. Alf
