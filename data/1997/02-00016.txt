Font problems under Word7
Dear Members,
I start to have difficulties while searching for any strings of letters
(say 'ddh' or 'one' etc; so, nothing special) in a document where I use
the Times New Roman Diacritics fonts ('tmsdiakr.ttf' and
'tmsdiaku.ttf'). This is under Word7 and Win95. With other documents,
where I don't use these fonts, there seem to appear no problems at all
while searching or replacing. 
Does anybody have a clue?
Any hints apprechiated!
