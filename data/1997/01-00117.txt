Indra weakened
Dominique:
While .Rgveda 1.32 may suggest this myth (in its next-to-last verse), full
versions can be found in the Mahaabhaarata:
5.9-17  is a long account that has Indra hiding in water.
12.272-73 (= Ganguli & Roy 12.281-82) has Indra hiding in a lotus filament.
There are many renditions of the story.
