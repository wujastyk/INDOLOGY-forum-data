Hemacandra's AbhidhAnacintAmani
In 1988 and 1990 an organization called the
Kalikalasarvajna Srihemacandracarya Navama Janmasatabdi Smrti Siksan
Samskar Nidhi (Ahmedabad)
published some reprints in honour of Hemacandra (maybe some more recently
that I haven't heard about). Although I'm not sure if they are still active
or even soliciting publications I'd suggest you write to Professor H. C.
Bhayani at the address below for advice. It would be an idea to state if
you have a preferance for publication in Devanagari or transliteration,
although I'm pretty sure Devanagari text would be more acceptable to most
Indian publishers.

A second question though, which edition of the AbhidhaCin. were you
planning to index? I can fax details of eleven separate printings of the
text between 1807 and 1964 if you're interested.
