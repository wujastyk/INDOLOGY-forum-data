The southern pronunciation is still recognizable as samaahaaravar.na, but can
we still say this in the case of the northern pronunciation? When "Maithi(li)"
sounds like "Kathy", the first vowel is not a diphthong. 
The northern short 'a' is more closed, but also weaker than the southern, and
this weakening of 'a' in the northern languages finally led to the final 'a' as
well as medial 'a' in non-stressed syllables being dropped from current
pronunciation altogether. I can imagine that a vowel which is so weak will
leave no trace as a distinct element in what was originally a diphthong but
later became a new single vowel with a distinct quality. This could explain the
phenomenon described in Sukumar Sen's _A Comparative Grammar of Middle
Indo-Aryan_ (par. 41), where he writes that ai and au became e and o in
Prakrit, "pronounced probably as" open e and o. This is what we hear when
Hindi-Urdu-speakers pronounce "hai" and "aur", which are written as if they are
diphthongs.
