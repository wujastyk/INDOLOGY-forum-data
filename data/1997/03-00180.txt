Subject: Question on Patanjali
Message-ID: <161227028955.23782.6390018219974037165.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I would appreciate if anybody could give any biographical information about
Patanjali, the author of Mahaabhaashya. The only thing I know is that he
lived at the time of Pushyamitra Sunga. Do we know anything about his
parents, lineage, teacher, teacher's lineage, place of birth, etc.? Also, is
there any etymological explanation for the word Patanjali?

Thanks.
