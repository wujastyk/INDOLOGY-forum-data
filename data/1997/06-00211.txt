The judgment "this is USENET stuff" is as objective a study
as another participant's "flights of fancy" froth.  Thus,
the contents of the list are indeed "USENET stuff" at the
hands of more than one person.  But to single one out for
target practice degenerates the list further, assuming that
"USENET stuff" is the low standard by which a so-called 
academician chooses to measures himself.  Dhanyavaad for
the foreign book recommendation, nevertheless.
