Could it be an anglicising of Melanie?!
Dear Philp. Patrick and Olivelle,
I have a niece in Bangalore whose name is Melanie. Her friends write it in
all possible ways: Malini, Melleny, Melony.... You know there are about 17
million christians in India and we were until some years ago forced to have
an European saint's name at our baptism. I was for example baptised with
the name "Boniface" which I changed to "Anand" when I was adult. The
European missionaries just couldn't believe us when we said that we were
going to be the first christian  saints with names like "Krishnamoorthy"
Ramagopalachari" "Janadhana" and so forth. And so were forced to have
ghastly names like Victor, Caesar and Napoleon... We have difficulty to
pronounce English names. Sorry. We make spelling mistakes. There is a
beautiful restaurant in my home town  Bangalore  (on the Brigade Road !)
called "Quality". But if you ever wish to find it,  ask for "Kallatti".
Philip, please send my greeting to sweet Melleny or to Patrick's Maalinii..
