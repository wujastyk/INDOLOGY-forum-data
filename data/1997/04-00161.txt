One would imagine that an such a publication would maintain some sort of
constancy in the transliteration of various scripts derived from a single
script such as Arabic. But such an assumption may largely be due to my 
ignorance on academic/scholarly standardizations. I was complexed as to
why certain characters of the Urdu script which are found in the Arabic as
well were transliterated differently from that of the Arabic. There were
also some differences in the transliteration between Urdu and Persian.

Could anyone clarify as to why such variations were decided upon?
