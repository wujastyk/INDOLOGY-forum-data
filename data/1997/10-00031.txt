Mayilvaakanan was his name before joining RK mission. (Father sAmiththampi &
mother KaNNammai).
It was the masterwork of his life; He redesigned (or 're-invented') yaazh
from the information given in the ancient tamil literature and wrote 'yaazh
nool' (The book on Harp).
Under that service he was the first pricipal of my Alma Mater, R.K.M. Hindu
College, Trincomalee; He was the first Tamil Professor in (my other Alma
Mater,) University of Peradeniya, Sri Lanka too as far as I was told.
He did a great job in establishing RK schools in Ezham (in addition to my
Alma Mater, Sivananda Vidyalayam, Batticoloa, Akkaraippaththu R.K.M. Hindu
College)
This is the task, we have to proceed further. It is the right way to respect
his sort of pioneers.
Hopes.
After looking this kind of saints in the yester years, I feel shame for our
contemporary sAmiyArs' behaviors.
fine today a fine day.
