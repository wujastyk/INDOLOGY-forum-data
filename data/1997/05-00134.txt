For more color/social status information in comparative IE traditions, you
might want to check out the essay as translated by John Lindow of
Dumezil's "Rigsthula and Social Structure" in Gods of the Ancient
Northmen, UCLA 1973.
Also, the shield of Achilleus in the Iliad has some interesting
parallels...
