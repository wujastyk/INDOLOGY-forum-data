Devanagari for the Mac

there were some public domain fonts around several years ago, 
of which I put a modified version at:
 http://www.newciv.org/jhs/fonts/fonts.html
these are old-style Mac bitmap fonts in 12 and 25 point,
not TrueType or PostScript. I didn't try them on 7.5.x, tho.
If you can't retrieve them immediately, I'm reshuffling the
sites on newciv.org currently. Ultimately they should 
resurface at 
 http://www.newciv.org/Sanskrit/
and
 http://www.newciv.org/Pali/  
If so, try again in a day or so.
This site contains also TTF and PostScript Roman-Translitared 
fonts compatible with  Prof.Norman's font (which unfortunately
do not scale very well at all).
If there are problems, pls send me private e-mail and I'll
try to take care of it..
