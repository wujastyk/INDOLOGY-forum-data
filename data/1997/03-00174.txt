I note of warning! I downloaded and installed this font, and then tried to
read the doc-files into Word6 for Windows. Since then, all letters are
printed more or less above each other. In order to get a readable text on or
off screen, I have to define a distance of 4 points between each letter.
Something is wrong, and I have not been able to solve the problem yet.
Anyone out there witha similar problem?
