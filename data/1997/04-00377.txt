so i hope you'll forgive me if i don't answere all the interesting points you
made.
another reason is that since each darZana has it's own answere, the discussion
could go on endlessly.
science
the
descartes never could have seen the ego as a sociolinguistic phenomena since
he believed it's a substance, 'something existing and being known by itself'
(spinoza). my point is that a soul needs a community and a history (or karma
if you want) in order to be aware of itself and to exist. to exist in a
community means to have a name. think of the patiens of psychiatrist Oliver
Sax who were cured of a kind of sleep during some 20 years. they found they
couldn't live in this time because their memories stopped 20 years ago. some
of them committed suicide others begged to stop the treatment. of course in
everyday language people talk about souls as things hidden inside bodies, but
i don't have to explain how problematic this view is.
