        The MMW gives the meaning potter in MBh to be in a scholia of
nIlakaNTha. But bhArgava is a frequent name in Adiparvan. At the end of it
(who seems match with your ref in K or B ed.) you find it in (critical ed.,
Tok. file):
        1-169-14, 1-170-9, 1-182-1, 1-183-2, 1-184-1, 1-184-2, 1-185-6
and, in same environment, kumbhakAra at 1-176-6

        I hope this can help you, but a rapid overview of this passages in
the hard Poona don't gave me anything.

        Namaste,
Dominique
