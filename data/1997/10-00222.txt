Hello
Dear Dr. Stern,
I hope you and your family have been well these days.
Thank you very much, as always, for your kindness.
It seems in Hiroshima that autumn flew swiftly by and winter followed. TV
says that it's snowing in Hokkaido, the northern part of Japan.
It has been quite busy these days. We are working hard to prepare for The
World DharmakIrti Conference which will be held here soon. Lots of
DharmakIrtian specialists, including Profs. Steinkellner and Hayes, will
come and present their papers at that conference.
If you need something from Japan, please let me know.
With best regards,
Jeson Woo
