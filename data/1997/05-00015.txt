Since this is, at least for now, a thought-experiment only, 
let me speculate.
Presumably you will have taught your hypothetical students the _present_
tense before approaching any form of the past. Perhaps also the
imperfective past, if not before the perfective, then at about the same
time. 
So _my_ guess is that the students will always perceive the _ne_
construction as some weird thing, an imposition, and never fully
internalize it, or at least not as deeply as the present-tense
construction. When
they learn that not all verbs use it they will be relieved, and more
likely than not, will develop a strong tendency to dispense with it
altogether.

What do those who actually teach or have taught Hindi think about this?
