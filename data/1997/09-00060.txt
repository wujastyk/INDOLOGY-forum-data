Tobacco
tobacco introduced to India by the Europeans?
Dear Poornima Kirloskar,
tobacco was introduced in Europe after the discovery of America. It is an
American plant and smoking is an American Indian custom. I doubt very much
that the Harappans smoked tobacco, whatever unhealthy habits they may have had.
At the same time, let me thank Dr. Houben for his introduction to Thadani's
work. This gives me an entirely new perspective on things. I never really
thought of K.r.s.na in that way. Indology at Western universities is really
so imperfect!
Best regards,
