I recommend reading what he has written, and then thinking about it.  It's
the method I most often use, and it works surprisingly well.

Sorry -- I'm being cheeky.  :-) I guess you mean getting an assessment
from *someone else*.  In which case you compound the epistemological
problem by adding the question of the informant's probity to that of the
subject himself.   In the end, there's really no way out of this one,
which is why book reviews are so often so unsatisfactory.

In a spirit of amusement,
Dominik
