Pali Canon on CD-ROM from Vipassana Research Institute
Dear friends,
We are happy to announce that the CD-ROM of the Chattha Sangayana Tipitaka
from the Vipassana Research Institute is finally ready for distribution.
The CD-ROM contains the entire Chattha Sangayana (Sixth Council) edition
of the Tipitaka, including the Tipitaka itself, the Atthakathas
(commentaries) and the Tikas and AnuTikas (sub-commentaries) and the
Vissudhimagga and its commentaries. In printed form this collection
would comprise approximately 140 books.
The text has been transcribed from the Burmese print edition produced
after the Chattha Sangayana. Special care has been taken to ensure the
correctness and authenticity of the text on the CD. The entire text was
typed twice into computers by separate typists and then thoroughly checked
and corrected by comparing the two corresponding texts with specially
developed computer software. Finally the text was carefully checked by a
team of highly competent Pali scholars in India and Myanmar (Burma).
