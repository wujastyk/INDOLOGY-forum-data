I'm not fluent in Tamil (which is a South-Indian language, last I heard),
but my understanding is that the idiom suggests either speaking
incomprehensibly or talking dirty, depending on the context. I don't really
know how much the phrase is used in TN these days since I don't live there.

Anyway, it was just a (very small) jest. As a rule, jesting falls rather
flat when it has to be explained! <g>
