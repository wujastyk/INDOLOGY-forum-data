International Journal of Hindu Studies holdings?
I wanted to order an article from the new International Journal of Hindu
Studies  vol. 1/1, but the library interlibrary loan folks tell me that no
library is listed yet as holding the journal.  Any help?  (The article I
want is Forsyth's on Ajatasattu).
