Jain Muni Ghasilalaji
Does anyone know anything about a Svetambara Sthankavasi Jain monk Muni
GHASILALAJI or have referencs to information about him?
I've traced details of more than thirty of his Hindi and Gujarati
translations of Jain canonical texts published in Rajkot (Gujarat) between
1936 and 1973 (some of the later ones edited by Muni Kanhaiyalala) but none
of them give any information about him.
