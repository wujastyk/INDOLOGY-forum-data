Update 3 to Pali Canon online
The third update to the machine-readable version of the Sinhalese edition
(BJT) of the Pali Canon from SLTP (IBRIC) is now available from the Journal
of Buddhist Ethics (JBE) sites in the U.K. and U.S. This is a minor update.
We hope for a more substantial update in January or February.
For those who already have a copy of the files, the only change is to the
Sa.myutta-nikaaya and only this need be downloaded.
As before the files are available from the JBE websites:
http://jbe.la.psu.edu/
Or, they can be obtained by FTP:
ftp://ftp.cac.psu.edu/pub/jbe/Pali
ftp://scorpio.gold.ac.uk/jbe/Pali
The main changes to the texts for Update 2 were as follows:
 One volume of the Vinaya (BJT Vol 1/PTS Vol IV) and the whole of the
Diigha-nikaaya and the Majjhima-nikaaya were proof-read once. The versions
of the Mahaaniddesa and Cuu.laniddesa were partially spell-checked. Further
missing pages in the Kathaavatthu were added. All the PTS page numbering
was completed, including the the four postcanonical texts. Some 30,000
errors were identified and corrected  in different texts.
The main changes to the texts for Update 1 were as follows:
Missing sections in the Diigha-nikaaya, Jaataka and Kathaavatthu were
added. Revised version of AN is included. There is some additional PTS page
numbering in the Khuddaka-nikaaya. Amendments were made to the
Mahaaniddesa. Small numbers of errors in various texts were corrected.
