MAY 4 FESTIVAL OF CULTURES CELEBRATES REOPENING OF JEFFERSON  BUILDING, LIBRARY OF CONGRESS
        LIBRARY OF CONGRESS MARKS PUBLIC REOPENING OF 
        THOMAS JEFFERSON BUILDING WITH COMMUNITY EVENT 
     To herald the completion of the decade-long restoration and 
modernization of the Library's original 1897 Thomas Jefferson Building and 
to celebrate its centenary, the Library is inviting the metropolitan area 
community for a free "Festival of Culture s" on Sunday, May 4. 
     The event is supported by The Xerox Foundation, which is also funding 
the exhibition, "American Treasures of the Library of Congress" that opens 
May 1. 
     Highlights of the celebration, which will run from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., 
rain or shine, are tours of the magnificent art and architecture of the 
building's interior; views of the new colonnaded area studies reading 
rooms of the European, Asian, and Afri can and Middle Eastern divisions; 
and visits to some of the decorated rooms that are normally not open to 
the public. 
      Performances by nationally known musical groups (see following 
schedule), celebrity readings, and treasure hunts for children will take 
place throughout the day.  Food vendors will be available for those who 
wish to purchase lunch and snacks.  All e vents are free. 
     The Capitol Hill community is also celebrating Friendship House's 
"Market Day" on May 4, providing yet another reason to spend the day on 
the Hill.  The 34th annual Market Day, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. at 7th and 
Pennsylvania Ave. S.E., features food, games for children, crafts, music 
and much more.  It benefits Friendship House, a Capitol Hill fixture since 
1904, which provides a wide range of child development and community 
services. 
     Visitors are advised to use Metrorail (Capitol South on the Blue and 
Orange lines or Union Station on the Red Line) to reach the Library of 
Congress as well as Eastern Market (Eastern Market on Blue and Orange 
lines).
