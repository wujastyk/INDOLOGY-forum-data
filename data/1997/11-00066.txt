The MBh ref. in the critical edition is 1.182-185. The Pandavas return
after Draupadi's svayamvara to tell Kunti what has happened: they enter
"bhArgavasya nivezanam"/"bhArgavakarmazAlAm" and say "Look what we got!",
and Kunti replies without looking up, "Make sure you all share it!". The
commentator Nilakantha (on the variant reading "bhArgavavezma tat" at
crit. ed. 1.181.40) glosses this as "kulAlagRham" - "potter's house" - and
this has been accepted by the translators Ganguli and van Buitenen.
