The vowel .r/ri in Sanskrit and Hindi
Dear list members
Would you agree with the statement:
'Most Hindi speakers pronounce the vowel .r as if it were the ri in rip.'
If you do then when do you think this change from the vowel sound .r to ri
began to take place and is their a similar variation in Sanskrit?
thanks
