Attitudes to Hindi, Tamil, etc.

Who was it who said "never attribute to malice
that which can be explained by stupidity"?  I
think India would be a less quarrelsome place
if everyone would make that their motto.
What an irony to write a confrontational
letter to a "Honorable Siv Mukherjee" -- a Bengali -- 
virtually accusing him of being a Hindi bigot?  The 
poor man is surely a bureaucrat mindlessly following 
some routine mandated by another bureaucrat -- who, 
for all I know, could easily be a Tamilian.  
In general, I think that the "system" in India
is well-intentioned, even idealistic in theory --
though usually bungling in practice.  And if one is 
friendly rather than confrontational, people will
usually see your point and try to cooperate.
And I wish our foreign friends would pick up some
of our good points, not our tendency to waste time 
striking poses of self-righteous martyrdom and
bickering with one another.
Sounds like the Hindi-speaking states at least
pretend to study a third language, while we
great and glorious Tamils have dropped even the 
pretence of studying any language other than Tamil 
and Hindi.  Which one sounds more fanatical?
I think more people in the world would study Tamil 
if we Tamilians would achieve something remarkable.  
Many people are now learning Japanese and Korean.  
It's because of those peoples' achievements.  Not 
because of their boasting, quarreling, and being 
just plain unpleasant.  You can't even sell a Big Mac
by being confrontational.  Much less convince people 
to study your culture.
Anbudan,
Raja.
