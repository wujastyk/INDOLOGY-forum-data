To this list the following may be added:
        4.  B. Datta and A. N. Singh, History of Hindu Mathematics, Part 1,
pp. 54--57,
which lists 'ari' for 6 (not for 3).  Mahaaviira's GaNitasaarasaMgraha
(SaMjJaadhikaara 53--62) mentioned by Dominik has also a long list of word
numerals (bhuutasaMkhyaas), but unfortunately it does not contain ripu or
its synonyms.
All the best,
