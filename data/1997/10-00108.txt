According to S. Radhakrishnan (Principal UpaniSads, p.p.899), jAbAla upaniSad
6 says, "tatra parama-haMsA nAma saMvartakAruNi zvetaketu durvAsaRbhu nidAgha
jaDa-bharata dattAtreya raivataka prabhRtayaH,....zuddha-mAnasah
prANa-saMdhAraNartham yathokta-kAle vimukto bhaikSam Acaran udara-pAtreNa

kuhara-kandara-koTara-nirjhara-sthaNDileSu teSv aniketa vAsya-.....".
He translates it as "saMvartaka, AruNi, zvetaketu, durvAsa, Rbhu, nidAgha,
jaDa-bharata, dattAtreya, raivataka and others are paramahaMsas...With a
clean mind (or a pure heart), for the sake of maintaining life, they must
fill at fixed times the vessel of their stomach with the alms obtained,
treating gain and loss as equal. They must live in places like a deserted
house or a temple or a shrub or an anthill, the root of a tree, a potters's
house, fireplace, a sandbank in a river, hill, cave, hollow of a tree, stream
in a deserted place......."

I would like to know if the translation is accurate, and if so, does not this
show the importance accorded to the potter's house? Could this indicate some
special relationship between potters and RSis?

Thanks in advance.
