        MOnsieur Patte,
                
                        The "Hala" is indeed a land measure.
        There is an equivalent measure which is still used
        in rural Ramanathapuram District of Tamilnadu.
        It goes by the name of "Eer saal thuuram" This is actually
        an arbitrary distance that a plough drawn by a pair of oxen,
        usually covers at a time. This is about 100 yards in length 
        in Ramnad.
                        There was an equivalent measure, that was 
        used in Britain. 
                        This was called a "Furrow long".
                        It subsequently became the "Furlong"
                        This is 220 yards.
