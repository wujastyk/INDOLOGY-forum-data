I have been told that OmniPage professional for the Macintosh can be
'trained' to convert practically anything to any desired character or
string of characters.  Since there are often problems with "i" versus "l"
in OCR I imagine the same would apply to e.g. ".h" versus "b".  As far as
Devanagari is concerned the nature of the script, where long strings of
characters are 'amalgamated' by the head-stroke there would probably be
some problem, unless the program could be taught to disregard the
headstroke!
