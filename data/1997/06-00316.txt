EkakSara and other ingenious forms of Slokas
There are 'plenty' of them in Telugu; Ekaakshara, dwitwaakshara, palindromes,
dwyarthi kaavya-s, use only: sa ri ga ma pa da ni, ..... you ask for it and
you get it!
A good start would be the compilations; _chaaTu padya maNimanjari_ and
_chaaTu padya ratnaakaram_ by  Veturi Prabkakara Sastry and Deepala Picchayya
Sastry respectively. Many such verses are attributed to Tenali Ramakrishna 
(aka Tenali Raman). Also check for pingaLi soorana's  (one of the 
'ashTadiggaja-s in Krishnadeva Raya of Vijayanagara's court) works; 
esp. _kaLaapoorNOdayam_.
_raaghava paanDaveeyam_ is probably the best example of a "dwvyarthi kaavya",
narrating the stories of both Ramayana and Bhaarata in same.
