delocutives [was Graha epithets (tArA,tArakA and tAraka)]

Yes, Dominique, I accept Saussure's distinction and find it useful. It is
the same distinction made by Benveniste, when he asserts that the
delocutive verb is to be derived from discourse, rather than from grammar.
The distinction is 'facile' when we have direct citation of a delocutive,
as in Allen Thrasher's nice example "to sonny-boy." It is more complicated
when one encounters a secondary formation like my example "yes-man", which
is built on a presupposed verb "to yes." I think that forms like the Skt,
*ahaMkAra* and *asmitA* are secondary formations built upon direct
delocutives.
In fact, both *aham* and *asmi* appear to me to be primary forms of the
delocutive in Vedic, that is, they both appear in Vedic discourse as
ritualized, or as you suggest, 'stylized', discourse. I find direct
examples of these discourse phenomena in the Vedic brahmodya, as well as in
the RV Atmastutis. In these contexts both *aham* and *asmi* function in "la
reponse a une question" and in precise ritual contexts. It is in the
context of such ritualized utterances that forms like *ahaMkAra* and
*asmitA* can be generated.
Agreed.
I'm not sure what you are asking for here. Deverbatives? Denominatives?
