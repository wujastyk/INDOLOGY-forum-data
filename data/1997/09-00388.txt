Grave Found, Possibly 5,000 Years Old
Namaste!
Lars Martin Fosse <l.m.fosse at INTERNET.NO> commented:
Perhaps because the smilies were deleted.  They are
now restored (see above).  I have run across many
Eurocentrics who refuse to realize that the world
existed before them and that others accomplished
a lot in science before them.  Some of these jokers
even teach in universities, misinforming others.
