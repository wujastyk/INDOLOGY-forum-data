================================
The Dharam Hinduja Indic Research Center at Columbia University
invites you to join us for a reception inaugurating a spring program  on

Domestic Conflict: Images of Brokenness, Strategies for Healing.
South Asian Perspectives

with an exhibit featuring the works of artist Malati Narsu

4:00-5:30 pm, Friday, April 11, 1997
Columbia University
Lehman Library, West Reading Room
International Affairs Bldg.(IAB), 3rd Floor
420 West 118th Street, New York, NY  USA

This recent series of drawings and paintings by Malati Narsu portrays
hardships of women in India, bringing practices such as female
infanticide, sati, dowry deaths, child marriage and prostitution to public
attention.   An artist from Long Island, New York living in the US since
1959, Narsu combines a background in Indian art with Western influences.
Her works have been shown at numerous venues throughout the greater New
York area, most recently at the American Museum of Natural History (1996).
Malati Narsu will be present at the reception on the 11th and will speak
from 4:45-5:00 pm about the inspiration for her works on domestic
conflict.  
Light refreshments will be served!
