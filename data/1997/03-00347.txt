(Fwd) query: Gita tapes
Dear Bhagavad-Gita lovers on this list,
I have a recording of a performance by students of Samdeepany
Sadhanalaya (sp?) from the late 70's. 
For my own study purposes and to save the contents of the damaged 
tapes, I transferred the audio to CD-ROM (WAV files). I also
made a program to index the chapters and many of my favorites
verses. In other words, I can select '5-4' and get the chanting
of Chapter 5, verse 4. This way, you don't have to try to follow
through 3 (three!) hours of audio tapes to find a specific location,
a task that may be undoable for a beginner.
I was not successful in locating anybody who could/would claim
a copyright on this recording. I heard that India Book House Pvt.
in Bombay has a similar recording. I wrote there a year ago
but never got an answer (address is: Mahalaxmi Chambers, 5th Floor 
22, Bhulabhai Desai Rd, Bombay-400 026).
I suggest you try to contact them. 
Regarding my CD-ROM, I do not wish to make any profit off a 
recording of the Bhagavad-Gita, copyrighted or not, but I cannot
give the CD away for free (a blank CD costs still over 7$).
Perhaps someone on this list has a bright idea about how such a tool
could be made freely available (it's about 150 MBytes of disk space).
