What a wonderful utility! It makes typing all the diacritics in romanised
Sanskrit so much easier than the usual shift + option + deadkey + letter! I
haven't explored all the possibilities of SILKey (with Devanagari fonts,
for instance), but I readily recommand it to everyone. And it's free. Thank
you Mr. Jonsson.
