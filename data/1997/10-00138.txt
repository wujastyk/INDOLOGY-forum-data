Terminology for conical structure on top of temples
        The Sanskrit term 'shikhara' (meaning 'peak') is used to refer to the
'tower' which rises over the sanctuary of Northern Indian temples; the flat,
ribbed part which rests above this is known as an 'aamalaka' (like the fruit
which it resembles), and the finial is a 'kalasha' (a 'pot'/'pitcher'). While
'finial' is normally used in English for the kalasha, I'm not sure of the
'official' architectural terminology in English for the other two parts (the
sources I have with me at the moment use 'tower' or 'superstructure' for the
shikhara, and I have seen the term 'ring-stone' used by Indologist Stella
Kramsrisch in reference to the aamalaka.
