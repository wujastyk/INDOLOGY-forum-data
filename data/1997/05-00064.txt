The vowel .r/ri in Sanskrit and Hindi
In Buddhist Sanskrit (as attested in manuscripts from Central Asia and from
Gilgit), Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit and Epigraphical Hybrid Sanskrit .r and
ri are very often confused; see F. Edgerton, Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit
Dictionary, 3.94,95, and Th. Damsteegt, Epigraphical Hybrid Sanskrit,
Leiden 1978, p. 22 f. This shows that the pronounciation of .r as ri must
have been common already in the first centuries AD, but it may be much
older, though perhaps not accepted by the Panini tradition.
Georg v. Simson
