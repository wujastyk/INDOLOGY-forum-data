Subject: Explanation for 'SaDja'
Message-ID: <161227032752.23782.11799652325358133481.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I have seen two explanations for the name of the musical note 'SaDja'.
According to one, 'SaDja' means 'the note born as the sixth'. The other
explanation is it means 'the note which gives birth to six'. Can anybody give
the linguistically correct explanation? Thanks in advance.
