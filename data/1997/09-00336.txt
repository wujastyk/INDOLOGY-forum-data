Yes, but I don't think many scholars *do* accept Goldman's dating. I
certainly don't; when I reviewed the Balakanda volume I commented that it
was difficult to concur with a chronology that gives the Ramayana a
sporting chance of predating the Satapatha Brahmana. Of course early
Indian textual chronology is hopelessly vague in absolute terms, but the
broad relative chronology is reasonably clear; the only way to accept
Goldman's date would be to push the whole lot back by several centuries
(which is not something Goldman proposes, as far as I recall).
The reference (R 5.28.17-18) is nonetheless an interesting one:  thanks
for drawing attention to it.
