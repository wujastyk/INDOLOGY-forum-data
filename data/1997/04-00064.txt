Subject: Nagarjuna in Vidarbha
Message-ID: <161227029339.23782.5561146674897593591.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I have been asked if I can provide any documentation for the tradition
holding that the Buddhist philosopher Naagaarjuna resided for some time in a
cave located on Ramtek Hill 30k north (or northeast) of Nagpur. I am
guessing that there is no archeological evidence to support this story, but
Bu-ston's History of Buddhism does locate Nagarjuna's birthplace in Vidarbha
so there may be some historical basis for the tradition. Can anyone provide
any further leads or references?

Many thanks in advance.
