Soma and fivefold rasa
Dear fellow indologists,
In adhyAya I, 29 of the ViSNudharmottara PurANa the lunar orb is described, among others, as:
zarIriNAM zaroreSu (read: zarIreSu) rasaM paJcAtmakaM smRtam / (5)
AlambakaM kledakaM ca tathA caivAvabodhakaM /
saGghAtakaM tarSakaM ca dehinAM dehagocaram / (6)
Since the numbering appears to span the zloka boundary, the following  half-zloka may also be connected in meaning:
manaH sarvendriyANAM ca sarveSAM nAthamaK tathA.
Does anybody have a hint as to the origin and meaning of this doctrine of soma as fivefold bodily essence: sustaining, moistening, awakening, holding together (?) and appetite-stirring?
Thanks,
