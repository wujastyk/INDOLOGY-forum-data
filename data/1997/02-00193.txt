An Exciting New Development
On the question of creation of technical terms in Indian languages, it may be
true that languages other than Tamil depend on Sanskrit. But in Tamil,
technical terms, at least for the past 30 years or so, have been based on
Tamil roots. Earlier terms which were created using Sanskrit roots have been
replaced with terms with Tamil roots. 
Example:
for chemistry
old term - 'irasaayanam' (from rasa)
new term - 'veediyal'
