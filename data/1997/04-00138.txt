Beekes, in his book on IE, reconstructs two different words, Hebhi
and mbhi. Is this an idiosyncrasy or does it find some agreement among
ohters? [I don't have Beekes' book at hand, so I am not sure what
words he gives for Hebhi. I guess he does not like the same word to
come out to mean `towards, against' as well as `on both sides'.]
