 what about early references specifically to the Sanskrit language? For that

Please refer to the following postings in Indology.

It was interesting to me that only PataJjali unambiguously calls the language
Samskrta. Madhav Deshpande's Sanskrit and Prakrit has some information on
this topic also.

On the Tamil side, the first grammar, tolkAppiyam, uses the word 'centamiz',
the correct Tamil. The attitude of ancient Tamil poets towards their language
was similar but secular.
