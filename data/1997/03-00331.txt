This has become the most prevalent practice nowadays. A symbolic cutting
followed by a quick shower, and then the rest of the upanayanam ceremony
goes on. One variation (sAmavedins?) insists on a complete shave of the
head before an upanayanam, but the standard version is to shave off an arc
at the front of the head.

This is the standard "kuDumi" in the Tamil regions. Nowadays, only
professional purohitas and temple priests sport such a knot. 

Among the nambudiris, the knot is tied not behind the head, but
above the forehead. It's called mun-kuDumi.
