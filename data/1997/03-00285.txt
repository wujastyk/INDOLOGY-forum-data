Tamil spoof request - Jana Gana Mana ...
3/27/97
Hi Friends,
I have a tamil poem by Kirubananda Variyar in the identical tune of 
"Jana Gana Mana Adhinaayaka ...", India's national anthem.
Variyar praises Murugan of six paDai veeDu temples in that song.
Of course. who else will he sing?
In the high school days, I have heard a spoof on our national anthem.
It has words like " ... iDli, vaDai, saambaar ..." in the tune of 
"Jana gana mana ...". A gentle mocking imitation.
If anyone remembers, please mail it to me.
Thanks,
N. Ganesan
