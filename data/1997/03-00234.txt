Message-ID: <161227029032.23782.13487993848756442604.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear members of the list, could someone please provide me with the
reference to Fritz Staal's work on "Rites without meaning"? I am for the
moment unable to find it, and need it for a student of mine. Thanking you
in advance, Jens Braarvig.
