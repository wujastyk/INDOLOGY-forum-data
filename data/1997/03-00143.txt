Indo-Germanic
I myself wonder about the "agenda" of people who are more disturbed by
political correctness than they are by what Dominique Thillaud eloquently
calls "nazionalism".  It's a matter of personal preference, I guess.
We all know that languages change [*even* one's own, by the way], and
sometimes for poltiical reasons.  American English has not suffered, as far
as I can see, from the disappearance of the "semantically inoffensive" word
"Negro" but I haven't heard or seen anyone use it, except quotatively, in a
very long time.
I apologize to Georg von Simson and others, because I know that this thread
has annoyed them, but to tell the truth sneers at political correctness
annoy me.
In any case, we have learned a little bit more about who we are talking to,
haven't we [a few years ago, by the way, I would have written "whom."  Not
anymore: I'm flexible].
