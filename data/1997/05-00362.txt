  If your question is in response to ancient Hindu "microbiology"
the question that would arise would be "Did the concept of microbi
ology exist then, as we understand it now?"
                                         In general, if you look
at Hindu thought as regarding food and its medicinal value, then
I can provide an example where modern science contradicts ancient
Hindu ideas. Modern Science tells us that garlic is very good for 
health i.e. it helps reduce blood presuure, whereas in Ancient
Hindu writings, garlic has always been more vilified than praised
(probably on account of its smell). The same is true of Onion, there 
are any number of ancient writers who had negative things to say 
about "Palan~Du", including a few subhashitaas which are normally
taught to children who have started learning Sanskrit. Modern
Science holds this to be incorrect.
                                  As regards conflicting ideas 
in conception, Srini Pichumani wrote yesterday that there seemed
to be a conflict between Hindu scripture and Modern Science as
regards the time period for a sperm to come to a stage where it
could fertilize the egg.
    If you are willing to consider  Western thought from the middle
ages, then what Dr Jonathan Silk has to say would be true in
many cases i.e. the theory of vegetative force, leaching and 
"bad blood" are just a few theories that come to mind...
