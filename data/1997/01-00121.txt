Pt. T.S. Srinivasa Sastri
Some of the students, colleagues, friends and disciples of the late Pt.
T.S. Srinivasa Sastri, formerly of the Deccan College Sanskrit Dictionary
Department, have been talking about the establishment of a trust to aid
Sanskrit scholarship and perpetuate the memory of this remarkable man. Some
possible projects in this connection would be publications, a scholarship,
etc.
This project will be coordinated by Dr. V. N. Jha of the Centre of Advanced
Study in Sanskrit, Pune University, Pune 411007
If you are interested in participating in or supporting this undertaking
please contact me or Dr. Jha.
