A genetic study of N. Indian population
Probably the results of this study must be qualified in the light of the
earlier evidence assembled in Tsuji,K. et al. HLA 1991. Proc. 11th Int.
Histocompatibility Worshop and Conference. Oxford Sc.Publ.: OUP 1992:
- D.P.Singh et al 'Distribution of HLA antigens in Asian Indians'
investigated 167 Indians (48 Bhargava, 72 Iyer, 47 Punjabis: Delhi Sikhs)
and 99 of a mixed Indian background in canada. The result is that all of
these groups clustered together and are clearly distinct from 'the rest of
the Caucasoid populations studied'. In addition differences between castes
were found, indicating the impact of endogamy.
- Tadashi Imamashi et al 'Genetic relationships among various human
populations indicated by MHC polymorphisms' also identifies 'Indians'and
'Iyers' 'Bhargavas' and 'Tribal Indian' to be closer to the Caucasoid than
the Mongolid populations in terms of 'standard genetic distance'. And
"Gypsy [Spanish] was interestingly the closest to Indian populations [in a
dendrogram constructed by NJ method, p.629]. This is consistent with the
idea that the Gypsy is of Indian origin" (p.630)
However, in another dendrogram (UPG method, p.628) the 'Gypsys (Spanish)'
appear far closer to 'South African (Blacks, Capetown)' than to the Indian
populations. For me this shows that a lot of work has to be done in this
field (related to transplant medicine) until more reliable results are to
be expected.
