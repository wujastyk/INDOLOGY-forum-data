Middle Marvari word
For this word, one may explore the possible connection with the Sanskrit
root chind "to cut, to tear".  In Marathi, the word cindhii occurs in the
sense of a torn strip of cloth, but in a Marathi poem, the soldier/gaurd
says to the intruder:  "Be warned.  Don't take even one step forward, I
will cut you down to pieces" (khabardaar, jar .taac maarunii yaal pu.dhe
cindha.dyaa u.davin raai raai eva.dhyaa).  Here the word cindha.dii is
used in the sense of torn pieces.  It is conceivable that the  Marwari
word cindhaRa/cindhaRiyo is a derivation from the agentive formation from
the root chid with the affix t.r : chindit.r, (already Prakritic, because
the standard Paninian form will be chett.r).  While the Sanskrit form is
chinatti, the form chindati is widely attested in Prakrits.
