Rig Veda, ta'ntra, nUl, and sUtra
Well, let me put it this way.  If someone shows me something and says that
it is one of a kind, and then I find something else that is of the *same*
kind and show it to her, I have not merely shown that her argument is
*improbable*.  I have shown that it is wrong.  No?
In any case, I do not accept the premiss that there are no such
resemblances between Vedic and the rest of IE.  As far as I can tell S.
Palaniappan's argument depends on a false distinction between tan- "stretch
[a warp]" and the other roots that belong to the semantic sphere of weaving
[e.g., u-, ve-, "weave"; vRt- "turn, spin", sIv-, syU- "sew"].
By the way, would anyone care to contest Monier-Williams's analysis of
UrNavAbhi, wherein -vAbhi is "from an obsolete root vabh- [= Grk. hyphainO,
Old High Germ. web-an, "to weave"]?  I myself cannot find any discussion of
this in the literature available to me.  Does anyone with easy access to
Wackernagel-Debrunner care to look it up?
One last note: I am willing to entertain S. Palaniappan's claim that there
is a historical connection of some kind between the Vedic and Dravidian
material.  But in order to consider the claim, for example, that the author
of RV 10,71 "was cleverly punning with the concept of 'panuval' since he
knew the two-fold meanings of Dravidian 'panuval' and its Indo-Aryan
equivalent 'ta'ntra'", I think I'd need more evidence.
Why?  Because there seems to be enough evidence, both from IE sources and
non-IE sources, to suggest that one could come up with the metaphor, speech
= weaving, independently of any knowledge of Dravidian.
For example, I would consider demonstrable *quotation* of a Dravidian
source in Vedic compelling evidence indeed [no question!].  But beyond
that, what other evidence would be considered *compelling* by others on
this list?  S. Palaniappan himself has acknowledged the possibility that
"we may be talking [about] some universal concepts."
