What exactly do you mean by "download the fonts ... and open it?" The PC
fonts on the server you are using are stored in archive files using the
zip format: to extract the actual fonts you have to run pkunzip, or some
equivalent program, on them. Have you done this?
Once you have successfully downloaded and extracted the fonts you want,
open up Control Panel and double-click on Fonts: then choose "Add fonts"
(or whatever exactly it says) and select the new fonts. This will install
them: they will be available for use by any program on your machine.
Hope this helps.
