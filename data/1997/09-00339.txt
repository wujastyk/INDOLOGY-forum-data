Nightmare. It wouldn't be impossible, but it would be *very* difficult:
writing the conversion program would require a skilled programmer with a
good knowledge of Devanagari, and would take perhaps a month of full-time
work. If you insist on using Word (or any other word-processor), rather
than following the suggestions that were made previously that TeX would be
the best route, you had better start all over again from the beginning.
