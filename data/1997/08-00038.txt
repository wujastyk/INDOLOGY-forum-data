Shrikrishna Patil
        Does anyone know the e-mail address of Shrikrishna Patil, resident
of Cupertino CA and  developer of a group of South Asian  fonts in
collaboration with Avinash Chopde?  Two years ago his address was
sapatil at aol.com, but now that address does not respond.
Merci d'avance
