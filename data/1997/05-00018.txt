`Conversational Sanskrit' vs `Real Sanskrit'

Or they might think of `ne' as the auxillary or even the whole
verb (because the participle agrees with the object). As long
as the construction is presented in neutral terms (instead of
`ne' is the `instrumental case ending') with `ne' as a particle,
I doubt that we can predict how this will be interpreted.
