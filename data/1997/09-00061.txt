Message to Prof. Parpola
I have tried to reach Prof. Parpola using his own email address twice, but
my emails bounce. Therefore I try Indology.
Dear Prof. Parpola,
concerning the dwindling circulation of Acta Orientalia: May I suggest that
you consider creating a subscription for private individuals that is cheaper
than the one paid by institutions (e.g. about 200 kroner / USD 25). Symbolae
Osloenses, which presumably has similar problems, is now offering individual
subscriptions at the price of NOK 195,- as against "normal" subscriptions at
NOK 320,-. Such a policy might help to keep the number of subscriber above
the magical number of 200.
Best regards,
Lars Martin Fosse
