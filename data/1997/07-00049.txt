How a buck/stag could have become a lion!
Well folks,
        My article on Durga/Korravai as seen in Pallava and Chola sculpture
is now posted, at this URL:
http://www.sxu.edu/faculty/rabe/Durga/Index.htm
I recommend having something else to read along side your computer during
the image downloads, though there's aways text of the article itself coming
in faster...
Enjoy,
Michael Rabe
