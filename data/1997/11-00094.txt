Ifthe IE root did not end i/u/r/l, the Sanskrit root as given in
dhatupaa.thas will have an `a' in them, like badh, pad, pat (from *bhedh,
*ped, *pet).

The real fun part is explaining such things as bhuu. This seems to
depend on the flavor of the laryngeal theory that the explainer
is believing in at the moment.

Is Ce:C a variant of CeC or from a totally different root (CeHC)?
