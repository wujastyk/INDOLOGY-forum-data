Indic baby names with a link to SURYA
"sAyan" is a synonym for "sUrya". So, how about "sAyanI"or, even, "sAyanA"?
Since we are talking about Indic names...I thought I'd ask you folks if
anyone knows the meaning of the GArgi. I know who she is in the upanishhads,
but what does the name mean?
Thanks.
