I think the answer to the question might be found in YudhiSThira's role as
a king. As such his position would be in the centre of the battle, and that
is the reason why he was called 'He who is steadfast/immovable in the
battle'. Compare the (relative) immobility of the king in the game of
chess, who in the same way would deserve the name YudhiSThira though he is
not a great fighter.
