Blind men and elephants
The story also appears in UdAna 6, 4 (p. 66-69) in the edition of THE  PALI
TEXT  SOCIETY.
A version of the same story is also to be found in the Massnavis of
Dschalaladdin Rumi, the persian poet who lived in the 13. c.
But sorry, I don't know exactly where to find it.
Best wishes,
Arash
