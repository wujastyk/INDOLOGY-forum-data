It would be nice if the word 'scientific' could be replaced by 'logical'
or 'rational' in the above. For an entity as elusive as god(s), science
can contribute almost nothing to a discussion on *what* a god is, let
alone prove or disprove *that* a god is. In a discussion of agni and
dIrghatamas, contemporary science just has to keep silent. 
Although most science adheres to a philosophy of logical positivism,
theories like quantum mechanics make scientists worry about what is meant
by 'existence.' But that is besides the point here. 
And, although a scientist myself, I see no need to invest the word
'scientific' with the exalted status that it seems to enjoy among
non-scientists nowadays. Somehow, being scientific is equated with being
certain. Even scientists would disagree with that perception.
