Hoch/Neben/Vor
Working through an article from 1889 on Vedic Accent, I'm trying to be
sure I'm translating these three terms correctly, as Leumann is arguing
for a restructuring of Vedic accent viz. ZB, so it's not always clear what
he means:
Hochton-- udaatta
Nebenton-- svarita
Vorton--  anudaatta
I'm feeling like nebenton/vorton are more likely anudaatta/svarita-- but
the evidence he cites seems contradictory.  To rule out a variable--can
anyone tell me the traditional German terms viz. Vedic accent?

It is ludicrous to consider language as anything other 
than that of which it is the transformation.
