Much like the Church of the Latter Day Saints, if you convert, and become a
Mormon, you can convert ALL OF YOUR ANCESTORS posthumously.

Or, as I discovered years ago, while I was a "practicing Unitarian,"  all
progressives and liberal thinkers who have ever existed, are defacto or
retroactively Unitarians (for they would obviously and innately HAVE BEEN
Unitarians, had the Unitarian Church existed in their era and/or locale).
