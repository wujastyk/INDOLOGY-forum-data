Query: Yoyombo script.
I've been trying to find books about the Yoyombo script, which is
traditionally used to write Mongolian, but have had no luck doing so.
Would anyone happen to know of any books on the Yoyombo script, and where
they may be located? I'm interested in learning the background of the
script and the conventions used in writing it.
Any help on this matter is greatly appreciated!
Thanks.
