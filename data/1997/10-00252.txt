Leitner
Dear Colleagues,
those interested in G. W. Leitner will find some interesting new,
unpublished and often unflattering information about him in
E.Errington's freshly published article:
"The 1878 Florence Exhibition of GandhAran Sculpture" in pages 139-214
in Maurizio Taddei (ed.), Angelo De Gubernatis. Europa e Oriente
nell'Italia umbertina. Volume 2. Naples 1997.
With best regards
Klaus Karttunen
