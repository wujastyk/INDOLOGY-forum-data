Dear Members,
I am very sorry for having sent a mail to INDOLOGY
to receive an unexpected response from a member.
Perhaps my expression was not appropriate.
The participants from India were all excellent scholars and
the Symposium was very successful in advancing mutual
understanding between Indian and Japanese scholars.
I seem to have over reacted about the very rapidly changing
cultural climate of urban areas in India.
I try to be more careful about the contents and
expression of my mail I will send to INDOLOGY here after.
