	This exchange between red and yellow is very interesting to me
because I believe this two colours are linked to warriors in eurindian
myths.
	So I have some requests about dice game:
	What is the meaning of -para in dvApara ? (if 'more than', that's a
bit confusing).
	I know kRta the better and kali the worst, but what about treta and
dvApara ?
	Regards,
