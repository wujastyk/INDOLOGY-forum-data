Subject: 'muzavu' in TiruvArur temple
Message-ID: <161227031244.23782.14044599531074480994.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

A few years ago, someone told me of a huge muzavu (drum) in the TiruvArur
temple. I do not recollect the details. Apparently, it is so big that it is
either sunk into the ground or has a ladder to climb on for playing. Also,
the only person who knows how to play that is in his 80s and after him the
knowledge of playing may be gone. Does anybody in the list have factual
details? R. Ghose does not talk about this in her book. (I am not talking
about the panca-mukha drum.) Thanks in advance.
