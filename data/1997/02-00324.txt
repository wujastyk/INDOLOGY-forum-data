Public domain vs. copyright

Hmmm, I'm quite confused... Are we speaking of the rights of the

created the machine-readable version of these texts?
Those e-texts available on the net are value-added ones reflecting
intellectual efforts of scholars, and are indeed copyrightable, aren't
they? Or should all the scholars working on classical literature put
their works in the public domain???
I think the notion of being copyrighted and that of being freely
redistributable are not incompatible ones, as the GNU Genaral Public
License shows. Those e-texts should be protected by copyright, *not*
to restrict their usage, but to guarantee the freedom of their usage,
freedom which will potentially be threatened by their commercialization.
