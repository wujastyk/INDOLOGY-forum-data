Pronunciation of Brahma
	The metathesis of h-initial consonant clusters in Sanskrit due to
Prakritic (and other possible) influences are indeed very old.  I have
discussed some of the problems created by this inversion in Sanskrit
sandhis in my paper "Linguistic Presuppositions of Panini 8.3.26-27",
Proceedings of the Intrernational Seminar on Studies in the Astadhyayi of
Panini, University of Poona, Pune 1983, pp. 23-42.
	While the Pali orthography keeps alive the cluster -hma- in words
like Braahma.na, the inversion is operative in words like guyha < Skt. 
guhya; mayham and tuyham < mahyam and tubhya.  The pronunciation of the
word Braahma.na as assumed by the Pali authors was in all probability
something like B(r)aahma.na, as suggested by the folk etymology of the
word as baah(ita-paapa-dha)mma.  The folk etymology seems to assume the
sequence of baah followed by mma.
	All the best,
