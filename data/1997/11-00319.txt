"Pedantry" was not used in a "bad" sense here! I just repeated the wording
of the question. As for the two methods for teaching skt. to beginner: In my
opinion, the "pedantry" of Renou and Gonda is preferable if the student is
an Indo-Europeanist. Otherwise, Aklujkars method is preferable. Which method
you should choose depends on your perspective.
But above all: There was no slight intended against the French language! :)
