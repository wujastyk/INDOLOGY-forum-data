Ancient Bardic Tradition in Indo-Aryan
Is there any comprehensive work on the bardic tradition in the Vedic and
post-vedic periods? Specifically, I am looking for information on whether the
bards called suuta and maagadha were also musicians? Or was there a
specialization whereby the suuta and maagadha were non-musical chroniclers
while the gandharvas were the musicians? Thanks.
