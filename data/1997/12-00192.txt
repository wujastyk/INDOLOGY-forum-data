tArakAmaya
Dear list members
I have been following the correspondance on tArakAmaya. It
seems to me that the answer to the question of its meaning is
quite simple. We have here a clear case of the use of the
suffix mayaT as marked by PANini "mayaT ca" in the sense of
"hetuvAcakAdAgataH". Thus tArA is tArakA plus mayaT. It
qualifies samaraH. Meaning there was a battle for the sake of
tArA.
I hope this is of some use for the people who posed the question.
