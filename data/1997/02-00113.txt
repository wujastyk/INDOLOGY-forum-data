with the Hindu and Jain bans on meat. From the beginning it was banned to
accept meat from animals that were explicitly killed iot provide for the
sangha, since that would be to encourage killing. Later the view arose
quite logically that meat eating per se was to encourage killing. It must
be noted in this context that the Buddhist and Jain concepts of karma are
quite different.

"Peace is not simply the absence of war.
It is not a passive state of being.
We must wage peace, as vigilantly as we wage war."
(XIV Dalai Lama)

"A coincidence, as we say in Middle-Earth"
