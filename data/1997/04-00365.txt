`real' Sanskrit vs `conversational' Sanskrit
The pronunciation of 'Jaina' as 'jane' is interesting indeed.  Clearly
there was a lot of dialectal variation in the pronunciation of the
diphthongs.  I have discussed some of this variation in my forthcoming
edition of Shaunakiiyaa Caturaadhyaayikaa (HOS, 1997?).  The coloring of
the components is an interesting issue.  For example, while most southern
speakers cannot distinguish between vaiyaakara.na and vayyakara.na, notice
the Pali veyyaakara.na.  This is a sign of some old dialectal coloring. 
For Patanjali, the constituents of e and o are fused with each other
(pra"sli.s.ta), while the constituents of ai and au are not so fused. 
These two are called samaahaaravar.na, groupings of vowels.  But for
Patanjali, the constituents of ai and au are viv.rtatara "more open" than
their independent occurrences.  This is, in my opinion, not the case with
the modern south Indian pronunciation of ai and au, where the initial a
seems, if anything, shorter and less open than the normal a.  In any case,
modern regional pronunciations of Sanskrit are more closely connected with
the regional vernaculars, than with anything inherited from Patanjali.
