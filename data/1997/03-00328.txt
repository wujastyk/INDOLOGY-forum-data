Middle Marvari word
I am interested in the derivation of the MiM word cindhaRa/cindhaRiyo,
which refers to a type of soldier in Middle Period Rajasthan.  Might it be
related to the Sanskrit compound cihnadhara?  Has anyone ever encounted
cihnadhara in a context that suggests "soldier" would be an appropriate
meaning?
Any suggestions?
Thank you,
