On Sun, 15 Jun 1997, JR Gardner expressed interest in gaining access to an
article by
C.  K.  Raja read at the V All-India Oriental Conf.  in Lahore, 1928: "The
Relation of Accent and Meaning in the Rig Veda." Peter Wyzlic informed on
16 Jun that the article was not published in the Proceedings, it appeared
only in the "Summaries of Papers" and referred to some sources in which a
bibliography of Kunhan Raja's works is likely to be found.  One should also
note in this context that this last January a conference to celebrate the
centenary of Kunhan Raja's birth was held in Kerala. Information on his
writings is likely to have been collected at that time. Contact:  Dr. N.P.
Unni, Vice Chancellor, Sree Sankaracharya University of Sanskrit, Kalady,
Kerala.  One of the most versatile Sanskritists of our time, Dr. Kunjunni
Raja, Adyar Library and Research Centre, Theosophical Society,
Madras/Chennai 600 020, is a nephew of Kunhan Raja. If the latter's Lahore
paper remained unpublished, Kunjunni Raja may be able to locate its
manuscript or typescript.
