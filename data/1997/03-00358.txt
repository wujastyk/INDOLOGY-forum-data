on hand right now).  From his annotations & such in *Peacock's Egg*, 
one got the impression of Masson as a serious Sanskritist (unlike 
poet Merwin, who simply worked -- as poets sometimes do -- from notes 
provided by his language-expert collaborator).  I do recall 
references to other works (or articles) Masson had published re: Skt. 
poetics or the like.  I guess I'm simply wondering or curious about 
Masson's general repute in the field -- as well, more particularly, 
abt. *The Peacock's Egg* (in terms of critical assessment).
Also, from N. Ganesan's presentation of Sakta reference works (for 
which, thanks), I begin to wonder if my recollection is amiss, re: a 
sense of what's intended by "twilight speech" -- but perhaps as a 
technical term in Skt. poetics, *Sandhya bhasa* was broad enough to 
encompass various (general & specific) sorts of irony? (including 
those practiced by the So.Indian Saktas, as referenced by Ganesan)?
