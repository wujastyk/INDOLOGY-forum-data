To which calendar do these modern movements adhere now that the Gregorian
calendar seems to be nearly world-wide?  The interesting thing about
numerical symbolism in eschatologies is that the particular calendar does
not seem to matter.  Millenarian movements are very syncretic -- using
everything from Jaina yugas to Mayan astronomical calculations.  Even
Christians who worry about the year 2000 use the words of Jesus, the
Apocalypse of John, Nostradamus and Joachim of Fiore who all lived by the
Julian calendar.
