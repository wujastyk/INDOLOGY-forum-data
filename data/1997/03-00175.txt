Well, Su"sruta's Nidaanasthaana 1 describes a range of "wind" diseases
some of which may well have been coincident with what we call cerebral
palsy today.  The trouble is that the aetiological categories,
terminology, and explanatory models are so different from contemporary
bio-medical discourse that it is often not possible to equate syndromes or
nosological entities with modern categories. 
All the best,
