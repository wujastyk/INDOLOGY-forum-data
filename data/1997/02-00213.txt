Subject: A text on cooking by Bhima?
Message-ID: <161227028485.23782.14718281115803667074.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

In an Old Tamil text called 'ciRupaaNaaRRuppaTai', when they describe the
quality of food given to some bards, it is described as "food prepared
without any error according to the text produced by the one with chest like
Himalayas and who was elder to the one with the holder for arrows which burnt
the grove (forest?)". The commentators identify the author of the text as
Bhima. Is this just a myth or is there really any Sanskrit text on cooking
ascribed to Bhima? Thanks.
