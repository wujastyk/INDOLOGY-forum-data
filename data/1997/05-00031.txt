hair's colour in Sanskrit
I have found quite the opposite of this opinion. In fact, it seemed
extremely ironic to me, as an American with light skin, that many Indians
were so obsessed with the minute differences of skin coloring. I have, on
several occasions, found a person that I considered to be very dark in skin
color make very snide remarks about another Indian based on the fact that
the other Indian had "dark" or "black" skin. I had to actually see the two
people standing together and look quite carefully to determine a difference
in skin color, but the one that was very slightly lighter clearly
considered himself "fair" and the other quite an inferior person due to the
fact that his skin color was "dark." I have also observed Indians referring
to clothing  as "black" (and therefore unsuitable) because it was a color
that an American would call light beige or off white.
