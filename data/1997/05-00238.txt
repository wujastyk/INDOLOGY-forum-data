Leitner
To all 19th century specialists!
Has anyone out there information about Gottlieb William 
Leitner (1840-1899,) and especially about his Oriental Institute in 
Woking, Surrey, which he was head of in the 1880's. It was somehow 
connected with the Punjab University in Lahore. Leitner and his 
Institute is mentioned in several letters we are holding in our 
library. Aurel Stein even stayed there for a short period.
Any suggestion welcome.
