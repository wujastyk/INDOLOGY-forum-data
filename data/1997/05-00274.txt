	Howard's comment, as I read it, is neither promoting scholarly
neutrality nor advocating metaphysical bias.  It is merely dilineating the
respective boundaries of the two.  How, then, is the posting
of his personal theological orientations, taken from a completely
different context, relevant to the argument he is making here?
