>Dear Members,

>On Nov.22--23, the Indo-Japanese Symposium was held in Tokyo
>in celebration of the fiftieth Anniversary of India's
>Independence.  Several scholars were invited from India
>(mainly Japanologists) and from Japan (mainly those
>specialized in Indian Culture, both ancient and modern). I
>made a report on the Indological studies in Japan in the
>last 50 years. What impressed me (or even shocked me) in the
>Symposium was the lack or even intentional neglect of their
>own traditional culture among Indian intellectuals.
>
>I want to remind Indian intellectuals that India is
>considered one of giant countries of the world mainly not
>because of today's India but because of her rich cultural
>heritage of the past. If their lack of interest in their own
>traditional culture continues, Indians will have to go
>abroad to study their our culture in the 21 century. I don't
>want India to be simply a field for collecting manuscripts
>for us Indologists. Nor do I want traditional India to
>become `India's Past,' as entitled in one of Macdonell's
>books.
>
>I am also afraid that the decreasing interest in their own
>culture among Indian people will affect Indian studies all
>over the word in some way or other.
