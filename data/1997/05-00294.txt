Internet access to the British Library Catalogue
Thanks for the British Library Catalogue information from Dominik.  I tried
it and got a "no DSN entry" [i.e., no address] message.  Is the service
already up and running?  If so, perhaps it is just too busy at the moment.
And, by the way, will be Portico service continue?  I've not been able to
get through to that URL either.
