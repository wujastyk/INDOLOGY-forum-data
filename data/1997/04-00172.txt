ivy's berries
Midnight is a fine hour to work, all is quiet, namaste!
	Searching the translation of 'berry' in the English-Sanskrit
dictionary of Vaman Shivram Apte, I've just found 'gulii' and 'guDikaa'
whose meaning is 'ball', 'pill'.
	Searching for 'ivy', just the periphrastic 'taru-rohiNii' and
'vRkSa-lataa'.
	Why ? no berries nor ivy in Bharat ?
	If anyone knows better words (genuine and more precise),I'll be
very grateful.
	And a second request: if there is ivy in Bharat, where ? (Arrien in
his Anabasis (record of Alexander's expedition) said it was a mountain
plant from the Meros (obviously the Meru), it's true ?
	Regards,
