Dear Dr. McClintock,
        thank you very much for your exhaustive information on the Sanskrit
Madhyamaka-hRdaya and its study in recent years. In a week or so I hope to
recieve some additional data bearing on this text, and I'll be glad to share
it with you. If you don't mind, I shall use your private E-mail address.
        With my best regards and deep gratitude,
                        Yours sincerely
                                        Yaroslav Vassilkov
