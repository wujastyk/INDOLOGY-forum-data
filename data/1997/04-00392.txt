We need to determine *what kind* of connection there is between these
terms.  It seems to me that it is not valid to jump from the assumption of
a semantic connection [or similarity] to a genetic connection.  The
semantic similarity is obvious, and is not disputed.  But I would dispute
the assumption of a genetic connection, unless you can provide *specific*
evidence of such.
There are *many* such in IE languages, and I have cited them already.  To
cite just one again: see Avestan vaf-, = "to sing, to weave".  Bartholomae
cites the Modern Persian form bAfad = "he weaves", whereas the Old Avestan
forms of this root = "sing, song, etc."  Compare Skt. ubh-, vabh-, clearly
a root extension of u-, ve-, already cited.
Maybe, maybe not.  But how can we determine whether this semantic
association, attested elsewhere in IE, the Near East, and Africa, is NOT
coincidence?  Surely, there is equally strong evidence that the metaphor is
widespread in IE.  It seems natural to assume that the Vedic RSis thought
that speech was like weaving because *it is* like weaving, and because IE
poets had been thinking so for millennia.
