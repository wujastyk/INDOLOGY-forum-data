I have a copy of the video on 'Acharya Sri Shankara' in Sanskrit
with English sub-titles, Produced/Directed by Sri G.V. Iyer.
The title is: "Adi Shankaracharya".It is in color.
I think you may get a copy & other details of the movie by contacting:
        National Film Development Corporation,
        D-6 Srisagar Estate,
        Worli, Bombay 400 019

Good Luck!

Sincerely,
