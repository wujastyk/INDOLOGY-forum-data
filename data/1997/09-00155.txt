The examples cited are just the tip of the iceberg. My job includes
copy-cataloguing Indian imprints and I see these all the time.
Just this afternoon I handled an item from Ejukeshnal Buk Ha'us
(Educational Book House), and a couple from Atmarama enda Samsa (Atma Ram
and Sons).
It took me the longest time to figure out that the Bengali-language
publishing house "De'ja" wasn't like in "deja vu" but rather "De's."

As for what became of the "Women for Women Research and Study Group," I
will leave it to your imagination...
