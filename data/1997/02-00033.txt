World Sanskrit Conference last month
Can I request someone in the list to post a short report
on the Sanskrit Conference held in India last month?
Topics on discussion, panels and projects will be interesting
to know.  Thank you for sharing.

PS.  We did hear about the disorganization and the political
participation etc..
