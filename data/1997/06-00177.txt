Is there any SEA by name Cape Comorin? Well, I can't see it on
any map! There is a PLACE/TOWN/CITY called Kanyakumari/Kanniyakumari
which was known as Cape Comorin in the British India days. But to quote 
your own self, how can we continue to call Kanyakumari "Cape
Comorin" when we believe that calling Bharat "India" or refering to
study of ancient Bharatvarsha as "Indology" is flawed and an insult
to our culture?
I would also like to discuss the meaning of the word "sarovara"
which Jai Maharaj/Krishna Kumar translate as "sea". According
to the Amarakosa, varivargah of the prathama kaandah, we have:
"samudrO'bdhirakupAra: pArAvAra: saritpati:
 udanvAnudadhi: sindhu: sarasvAn sAgarorNava:
 ratnAkaro jalanidhiryAda:paritarapAm pati:"
This is the first stanza in this section and gives us synonyms of the 
word "sea".I realise that sarovara: can be regarded as a variant of 
sarasvAn,but Bhides dictionary i.e. (vidyAdhar vAman bhiDe: A concise
Sanskrit-English dictionary) lists only "lake" against sarOvara:
( and not "sea"). Likewise "amarkOsh kA koShshAstrIya tathA bhaShA
shAstrIya adhyayan" by Dr kailAshchandra tripAThI (This book is in
Hindi) says on Page 104 regarding the word "saras" - amarkoSh mein
"jalAshay" kE paryAya sangrahit hain. iske atirikt "hradah" ( agAdh
vAlE jal sarovar) tathA alpasara: shabdon kA bhI ullEkh hai. He does
not mention anything about the word "sarovar" under the entry for 
"samudra"(sea).
To the best of my knowledge the word "sarovarah" CANNOT be translated as 
"sea" but would translate more as "A body of water" i.e. lake/pond.
So, my question to you is: Is the author correct in assuming that 
"sarovarah" is "sea/ocean"?
