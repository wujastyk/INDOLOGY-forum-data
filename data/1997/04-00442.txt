      Searching Indology Archives
     *****************************

With Indology postings growing, it will be great if
we can search for a WORD in all of the postings in
the archives.

Not only the titles, but inside the postings too.
I request Dr. Dominik Wujastyk to take a look at this.
It will be very useful.

Thanks,
N. Ganesan
