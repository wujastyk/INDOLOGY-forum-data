         From *ag- 'to lead, sacrify, burn': *ag-n- 'fire', locative in
 Agnideva 'the God in the fire' > 'the fire'. With a nasal infix with
 causative sense *ang- 'to make a fire, a sacrifice', with agent suffix
 *-h1-l- : *angir- 'sacrificer'. The masculine sigmatic thema is an
 intensive abstraction: 'THE sacrificer'.
         We don't know the first rapports between Aryans and Dravidians. To
 suppose one of them better than other is just a fiction intending to attise
 the hate between today's people. In fact, both contribute to give birth to
 India. Compare the best known rapports between Greece and Roma: who was the
 winner ? >>
I defer to IE specialists in this regard. Only when they find available
etymologies unsatisfactory, I explore the possibility of a Dravidian
influence. I had already quoted the etymological discussion by Staal. I
think, Staal and other IE scholars were not satisfied with an etymology which
could not explain the whole word aGgiras. Since IE scholars had settled on a
non-Vedic origin of aGgirases as a people, and "aGgi" was an attested form in
Dravidian for the borrowed "agni", exploration of Dravidian borrowing and
re-Sanskritization seems a potential way to explain it. On the other hand, if
you could come up with an etymology which will explain the whole word, that
should be seriously considered.

While we do not know a lot about the interaction between early Dravidians and
IA-II peoples, I try to base my analysis on findings of scholars such as D.
D. Kosambi whose works, I presume, are well-respected by Indologists. I try
to call a spade a spade without any political considerations.
