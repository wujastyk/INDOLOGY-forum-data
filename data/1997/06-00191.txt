In Karnataka:
 
Excerpt
 
   "Sri ADICHUNCHANAGIRI MAHASAMSTHANA is situated on 
a rocky hill at an altitude of about 3,300 ft., above 
sea level, 110 kms west of Bangalore, the capital of
Karnataka, India. 
   "In ancient times, this abode of green woods and 
small lakes enlivened by the wild peacocks and birds 
must have attracted Sages and Rishis for doing penance. 
Lord Gangadhareswara is the Presiding diety. Sri 
Kalabhairaveswara is the Kshetrapalaka of this 
Mahasamsthana. The Pancha Lingas, the Jwala Peeta, 
Sthambamba are all held in great reverence by the 
devotees. The peak point of this Giri [hillock] is known as
Akash Bhairav and the scared pond is called Bindu Sarovar."

That means Bindusarovar is not the sea near Cape Camorin.
 
Are the two Bindosarovars mentioned wellknown enough to serve
as the southern boundary of Hindusthan ? If so which one of them
is the southern boundary ? It will be nice if some rationale
behind the choice is also mentioned.
