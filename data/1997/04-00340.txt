AOL4FREE.COM IS NOT A HOAX
A Trojan horse program called AOL4FREE.COM is circulating on the Internet. 
This is not a virus and cannot be detected by most anti-virus programs. The 
program is executed by the individual user and deletes all files on a hard 
drive.
PLATFORM: DOS/Windows-based PCs
DAMAGE: When the AOL4FREE.COM program is executed, all files and directories 
on the user's C: drive are deleted.
DO NOT execute this program. [Note:  Double clicking on.com 
or .exe will start a selected program.]  If the program starts      
executing, quickly pressing Ctrl-C will save some of your files. If 
this has happened, shut down immediately and call for         
assistance.  DO NOT attempt to write anything to your hard drive. Files 
that have been destroyed may be able to be recovered IF you have 
not written anything to the hard drive and IF your system has not written 
anything such as when utilizing a auto-save program.
Please see CIAC Bulletin H-47 available on the CIAC homepage 
(http://ciac.llnl.gov/) for detailed information.
