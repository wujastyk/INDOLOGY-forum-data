There is an intriguing thing about the corresponding word for brahmin
in telugu. It is not with ordinary `r' but with `R' the sakaTa rEfa.
Thus in 7th century inscriptions we find the word `pARa' used for
brahmin. In the classical literature we find `pARuDu' , `pARuvADu'
denoting brahmin.

Some telugu scholars feel that this is due to mixing up of the two
`r's. But I do not think so for the following reason.

In the evolution of a language the natural tendency will be to replace
the difficult to pronounce or difficult to write letters with easy ones.
In telugu the tendency as far as I know has been to replace `R' with `r'.
I am subject to correction on this point.

For the root `pa' or `paravu' denoting spread we have, in addition to
the `r' form (`parapu'), we have also the form `PaRuchu' with the same
sense.

Now my question is, how strong is the etymological evidence for
derivation of pArpan from `pAr' to see.
