A text on cooking by Bhima?
While I am not aware of any text on cooking ascribed to Bhiima, I would
like to point out that the association of Bhiima with cooking is old. The
Mahaabhaarata itself depicts Bhiima as working as a cook for Viraa.ta. The
Paa.n.davas are then living incognito. Bhiima assumes the name Ballava. (MB
4.2.1-7).
The other well-known MB character associated with cooking skills is Nala.
One comes across attribution of texts to him too.
