Etymon: paTTaN, pattan, patan
One of major Buddhist pilgrimage places is today's Sarnath which was
"back then" called Isipatana.
Now, some derive this "patana" from pat-, thus the meaning would be (isi
is of course r.si) "falling of sages" - which sounds funny.
Other explanation is again Skt. patna etc.
