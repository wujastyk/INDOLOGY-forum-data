My notes remind me:
rasa                  colour               deity
S.rn.gaara  erotic:   bluish black         Vi.s.nu
haasya  comic:        white                Siva
karu.na pathetic:     ash colour           Yama
raudra  furious:      red                  Rudra
viira  heroic:        light orange         Indra
bhayaanaka terrrible: black                Kaala
biibhatsa  odious:    blue                 Mahaakaala
adbhuta marvellous:   yellow               Brahma
Saanta  peaceful:     jasmine              Naaraaya.na
B.N. Goswamy did an exhibition catalog for the Asian Art Museum in San
Francisco that was titled <Essence of Indian Art> (1986) I think there's
quite a bit of rasa theory in there and an attempt to correlate rasa theory
with the visual arts.
