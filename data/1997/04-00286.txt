I have made a TrueType font, called LeedsAccent, containing all the
Latin-alphabet characters I can cram into it, plus all the
diacriticals that I know of. The diacriticals are coded separately,
so almost any accent(s) can be combined with any character. The font
is free for non-commercial use.
It's not particularly beautiful, being based on Bitstream Charter,
but it works. (I'm working on another version, to look more like
Times New Roman, as well as a Cyrillic equivalent.)
I'd be happy to send copies to anyone who is interested.
I suggest that you send such requests off-list.
