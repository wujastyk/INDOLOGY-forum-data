Dhaatuko'sa
Dear Members of the List:
I am about to embark on a research project that looks at the importance of
the __Dhaatupaa.tha__ in the revival of Indian grammar.  I will start with
the debate between Whitney and Bhandarkar and from there expand my
examination.  My principal source has been Frits Staal's __Reader on the
Sanskrit Grammarians__: beyond that, I've not had much success. Any source
that muses on the Dhaatupa.tha would be much appreciated.  Thanks in advance.
