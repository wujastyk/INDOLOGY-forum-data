Vol. 50 in the Harvard Oriental Series is Rig Veda: a metrically restored
text with an introduction and notes, ed. B. A. van nooten and Gary B. 
Holland, 1994. It contains a disk with (a) the Aufrecht edition in
more-or-less standard CSX transcription, (b) the metrically restored text
in a version of CSX that has been extended in various undocumented ways. 
The Aufrecht text (which seems very accurate where I have looked at it) 
would probably suit Dr Leavitt. As I recall, there are few if any
restrictions on its non-commercial use.
