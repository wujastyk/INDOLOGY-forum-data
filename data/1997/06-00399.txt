Dear members, for some technical problems I am not receiving the mail from
indology-l. Anyone who posts something connected with my recent queries
(Translations of Gitagovinda; Kavya commentaries; or anything equally
interesting :-) please send a copy to my e-mail address:

I may have not received all of the postings from the last two or three
days. If you have replied something to my queries, please bounce that to
me.


Thanks 
	Jakub
