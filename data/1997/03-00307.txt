Dear Colleagues!
We are promoting a Thai- Austrian Friendship Project on
the web. The primary goal is to present a new approach to Asia 
today and to help enhance intercultural understanding.
If anyone of you is interested in creating a link from your 
homepage to our website, please e-mail to us.
In addition we would like to contact South East Asian orientated
study centers. Could anyone send us contact addresses?
Thank you.
Kind regards
Sachsenmaier
