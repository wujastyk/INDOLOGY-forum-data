I'd like to thank Sundaresan Vidyasankar for answering my questions in
a relaxed, factual, dispassionate, informative manner.

I hadn't realized the "three-language formula" was something which had
to do only with educational policy, so I might have asked what could
seem like somewhat odd questions.

Thank you for clarifying it all.

Jacob
