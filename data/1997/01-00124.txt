R. Soneji gave a list of books on Durga Saptashati (=Devi Mahatmyam). Here is one more, plus a question:

Devi Mahatmyam Translated & with a commentary by Swami Siddhinathananda. Bharatiya Vidya bhavan, Kulapati Munshi Marg, Bombay.

This book was reviewed in Vedanta Kesari (Oct. 1996) by P.S. Ramamurti. 

Question:
In the above review Ramamurti says: "There are seven existing commentaries on Devi Mahatmyam."
Does anyone know more about these commentaries?

Thanks and Om,
Swami Vishvarupananda
