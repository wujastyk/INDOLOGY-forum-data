Creation of Durga
R. Soneji gave a list of books on Durga Saptashati (=Devi Mahatmyam). Here is one more, plus a question:
Devi Mahatmyam Translated & with a commentary by Swami Siddhinathananda. Bharatiya Vidya bhavan, Kulapati Munshi Marg, Bombay.
This book was reviewed in Vedanta Kesari (Oct. 1996) by P.S. Ramamurti. 
Question:
In the above review Ramamurti says: "There are seven existing commentaries on Devi Mahatmyam."
Does anyone know more about these commentaries?
Thanks and Om,
Swami Vishvarupananda
