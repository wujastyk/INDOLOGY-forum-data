Aalim aalam
Just to add to this, and to put more simply,
"aalim" means the one who knows, reference to a scholar, especially 
religious scholar in Persian and Urdu usage of the terms.
the second word "aalam" means the world/universe and in Urdu also refers 
to a 'condition' for want of a better word.
and yes it is also the name of a computer software.
