time to meet?
Hello Peter,
I am finally able to stick my head above water briefly and so I am taking
the opportunity to write. I hope you remember the brief conversation we had
at the Tamil conference about the possibility of doing one of my MA field
exams in South Asian folklore?
Can we meet sometime next week to talk about this?  Any of the following
days will work for me: Monday (5/26), Wed (5/28) or Thurs (5/29) in the
afternoon (1Pm to 3Pm). Would one of these times work for you?
Jeyanthy
