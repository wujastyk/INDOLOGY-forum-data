Nice to see some mathematics on this channel! Actually, I think that your
observation is well worth looking into. The number 3 is sacred, and the
ancient Indians (and not only them) had a thing for mystique. Indologists
with an interest in mathematics or numerology might find something of
interest here. One caveat: Beware of drawing uncritical solutions!
