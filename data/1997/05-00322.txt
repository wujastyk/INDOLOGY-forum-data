locative compound: 'the Celestial *in* the fire'. From here perhaps Agni as
a God's name and agni as the new fire's name.
	So, if I'm right, Agnideva is not a God but the name of the
Celestial *when* in the fire (sun, lightning or sacrificial fire). This can
explain why Agni is too Soma, Apaam Napat, &c.
	Hoping to help,
