mathematics , mysticism......
I confess that I am entirely ignorant of mathematics, and I don't
understand the first half of this paragraph, but: there is considerable
information available about old Indian ideas of embryology and gestation.
One interesting fact -- I think it is a fact, and I plan to write about it
in the context of a study of the Buddhist text Garbaavakraanti-suutra -- is
that discussion of gestation in terms of *weeks* in this text, which almost
certainly comes from the Northwest, and probably belongs to the
Muulasarvaastivaadins, appears to show Greek influence.  Unfortunately this
text is not extant in Skt, only Chinese and Tibetan, but probably the word
for week is saptaka.  The progress through the various embryonic stages is
denoted by weeks, and the total gestational period is, if memory serves (I
don't have the text at hand) 38 weeks.
is all entirely irrelevant!
