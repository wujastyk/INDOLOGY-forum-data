There are several important aspects of using this list which *ALL* members
need to be aware of. I have posted this information several times.
However, many of you just seem to ignore it. As a result keeping the list
running is taking more and more time. I'm not an Indologist and my site
has little if any research/teaching interest in this area. We run the
list simply as a favour (in particular to Dominik) and get no renumeration.
I find it difficult to justify running the list when I have to spend about
30 minutes a day sorting out problems which people could have fully or
partially resolved themselves.

Phew got that off my chest!

Here are 2 recent postings from me which you should take careful note of.

Can I again remind all subscribers that you *must* post from the
address at which you subscribed. To protect you from unsolicited
email we only allow Indology subscribers to post. In this context 
the list processing software decides if you are a subscriber by
looking for the address you are posting from (ie what's in your
From: field) in its list of subscribers.

In the last few days there has been a deluge of attempted postings
which have failed for the above reason. In the early days I did
help people who had this problem and we sorted most instamces. 
If you have recently hit this problem then please email me c/o 
indology-request at liv.ac.uk . Simply trying again won't work!

We are currently in the process of changing list servers from listproc to listse
rv. At 
the moment there is a shadow version of the Indology list of subscribers under 
listserv. This is there for us test various things. Therefore, at the present time
the real version of the list is the one managed by listproc. This has several 
consequences:

1) You need to advise potential subscribers to use the listproc address. We're 
starting to see new users trying to subscribe via listserv - this won't get them
 any 
email at the present time.

2) Any change in subscription options need to be sent to listproc.

3) Signoff requests must go to listproc. Again, we're seeing existing members of
 the 
list using the listserv address. A signoff to listserv will remove you from the 
shadow 
but won't stop any emails.
