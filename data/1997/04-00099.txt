In Tamil the writings of cuppiramaniya parathiyar (I have used a spelling
which will be useful for library catalog searches) and especially his work
"pAJcAli capatam" dealing with the episode where draupati swears not to braid
her hair until duhsasana is killed . Here India is supposed to be
figuratively portayed as draupatI.
