   Q. kOtAri, vAytAri/vAytArai, pazu
   **********************************
Again, I need some help in literary citations of three words
from Madras university Tamil Lexicon.
1) kOtAri - epidemic, pestilential disease
          - koLLai nOy, peruvAri nOy, vishak kAyccal
2) pazu  - round of a ladder, rib
         - ENip paTi
3) vAytAri/vAytArai - humming, talk musically
                      meTTu, tana-tana ennum cantam
Thanks a bunch,
N. Ganesan
PS:
In JayamkoNTaar's aatinaatan vaLamaTal that I am editing these words occur.
pazu, not in the usual meaning of 'to ripen', but as a ladder step.
kuLam, not the regular pond, but as forehead (neRRi)
(kallATam also has that usage: tirukkuLam muLaitta kaN tAmarai,
The eye-lotus on the forehead(kuLam) of Shiva).
