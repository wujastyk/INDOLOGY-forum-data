reference in Shorter pw?
I wonder if someone with access to the _Sanskrit-Woerterbuch in Kurzerer
Fassung_ could very quickly look up something for me: A reference I have says
"Accordin
g to Boehtlingk (dict. vol. VI, page 130) Sitaa is a "Beiname" of the
Ganges." Is this a reference to this shorter dictionary?  Is the mention of
Sitaa found on
 that page?  (It is not in the big dictionary, which I do have.)
Thanks in advance!
