Message-ID: <161227031650.23782.3933637486957866741.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>



I need a poem starting with the word "collarum" from the
Tamil Jaina epic, ciivaka cintaamaNi. Can anyone send that
viruttam for me please?

The University of Koeln library catalogs, tamil classical texts,
Tamil lexicon cannot be searched nowadays. Can somebody look
into that please?


Thanks
N. Ganesan
