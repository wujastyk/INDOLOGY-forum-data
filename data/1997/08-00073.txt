When I visited India in January of this year the Vrindavan Research
Institute was closed and had been so for about five months because of an
industrial dispute.  I am planning to return to India again in December and
would dearly like to look at some material there.  Can anyone tell me
whether the VRI is open again?  Maybe someone from SOAS  would know.

Merci d'avance

Adrian Burton
