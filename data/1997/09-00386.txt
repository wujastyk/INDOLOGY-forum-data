CONSTRUCTING TIBETAN CULTURE: Contemporary Perspectives
Edited by Frank J. Korom
 =======================================================================
_Constructing Tibetan Culture_ provocatively explores the numerous
ways in which Tibet has been represented to the outside world in the
past and present. The volume attempts to move away from earlier
colonial and romantic descriptions of Tibet as either an utopian
paradise or a degenerated wasteland. By interrogating such dichotomous
representations generated by foreigners in both historical and modern,
ethnographic contexts, the authors demonstrate that culture-building
is an ongoing and dialectic process involving a number of different
cultural groups, both indigenous and foreign.
   Through an examination of a wide variety of themes ranging from the
terminology we use to describe Tibet, its people, religion, and
culture to the virtual exclusion of Tibet from the literature on global
diasporas, _Constructing Tibetan Culture_ attempts to relocate modern
Tibetan studies squarely within the realms of anthropology and cultural
studies. By addressing such theoretical problems as the foreign
appropriation of Tibetan artifacts and religious practices, as well as
the emergence of newly created or renegotiated expressive traditions in
exile, the contributors to the volume share a common concern for moving
away from essentialist understandings of Tibetan culture in favor of
more critical approaches within an interdisciplinary academic context.
   With its extended set of case studies about Tibetan culture and
worldview, _Constructing Tibetan Culture_ suggests that the concept of
"authenticity" is not easily defined in the modern world, for it
becomes a contested concept when it enters the world marketplace of
culture. In this global arena, many communities bring their own
interpretive agendas to bear on matters relating to Tibet and its people,
forcing Tibetans themselves to enter into a densely layered conversation
about their own identities, cultural traditions, and religions.

PRAISE for _Constructing Tibetan Culture_
"The first book to explore the entire range of international
representations of Tibetan culture. In one brilliant sweep, the
contributors examine such diverse phenomena as orientalist ideas about
Shangri-La, romantic conceptions of Lamaism, the influence of the Tibetan
Book of the Dead on Western literature, and the role of exile art in the
contemporary development of Tibetan culture. Fascinating!"
                                        Andre Gingrich
                                        University of Vienna
"This is the first book to take a serious look at...the refiguring of
Tibet in Western consciousness and of the complex and ambiguous position
of Tibetan refugees....[The contributors] examine Tibetan issues with the
full range of theoretical resources of contemporary scholarship. This is
an important book for Tibetan studies and is likely to interest many in
the wider fields of cultural studies and postmodern studies."
