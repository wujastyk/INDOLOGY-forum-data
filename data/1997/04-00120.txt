VYAKARAN: Re: Classical Sanskrit Accent
I don't normally post corrections to my English mistakes but this one
could lead to misunderstading. I wrote:
I meant "I hope this [how I had just paraphrased MW] is correct", and
of course not "I hope it [what MW had said] is correct".
Cheers

ps: and while I'm at it, I wrote
Of course I meant, "the post Madhav Deshpande was responding to".
