This subject of death in ancient India, brings to mind one nagging lexical issue:
amrtam.

amrtam has alchemical overtones; it seems to refer
to the imperishable nature of gold as the early seekers
found means to smelt rocks, extract and purify the metal.
And hence, extension of the concept of imperishability
to the body...??

Regards, Kalyanaraman.
