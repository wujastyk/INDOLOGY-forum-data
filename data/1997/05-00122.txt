Query: Pseudo-Nagari/Roman script.
Here's another orthography-related question that I've been meaning to ask,
but keep forgetting. I've seen a certain typeface which is the Roman
script written in such a manner as to resemble Devanagari. Would anyone
happen to know the name of this typeface/style?
Thanks.
