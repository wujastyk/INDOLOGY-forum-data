measures
Speaking of measures there is an anectode in which the word `ziva' is
interpreted by the vaiSnvaiTe to mean a measure, to refute the
argument of an opponent.
zaivaite: zivAt parataram nAsti. (There is nobody greater than Lord Ziva)
vaiSNavaiTe: drONamasti tatah param. ( Why, `drONa' is larger than it)
`drONa' happens to be a larger measure of volume than `ziva'.
