hair's colour in Sanskrit
I have been told by reliable sources that Amharis (who are
chokolate-coloured) look down upon the blacker Sudanese, who are regarded as
inferior. In Norway the Amharis suffer the misfortune of being regarded by
Norwegians as "negros", which apparently is a bitter pill to swallow. 
As these stories appear on my screen, the sheer folly of racial prejudices
becomes apparent. If you manage to forget the suffering that invariably go
with them, they are always absurd and ridiculous, sometimes hilarious. Man
is a hierarchical animal, but there should be limits to the ways and means
used.......
I suppose this is the ultimate absurdity: Millions of white people spending
hours in the sun (and often rather a lot of money to get to a sunny place,
as we do here in Scandinavia) in order to look like someone they would
despise if s/he where born with the skin colour they strive to obtain.
