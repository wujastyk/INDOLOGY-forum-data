If you do manage to get the book and accompanying audio
tapes for your library,  please tell the library folks
to put a huge "DO NOT THUM" sticker on the audio tapes...
at the U of M, Ann Arbor, the tapes have been rendered
useless by someone at the check-out counter who ran it
thru the machine that sensitizes/desensitizes the labels.
