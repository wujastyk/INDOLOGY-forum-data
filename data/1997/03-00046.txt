I am working on an Edition of Paippalada Samhita for my dissertation.  I
have a practical question: is anyone aware of any editing program with
automatic numbering of varients in the old copy-book style.  Meaning that
the variants of each mss are arranged under each individual head word?
Thanks for your help.
