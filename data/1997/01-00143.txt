Though the first and most common name that came to mind was Usa, on later 
speculation, the following also seemed appopriate:

Amsumati - possessing (mat) rays (amsu)
Bhanumati - possessing (mat) sun-like nature (bhanu)
Dinakartri - maker (f - kartri) of day (dina)
Jyoti - light
Prabha/Prabhavati - the luminous
Prakasini - shining one
Tejasvini - having tejas
Tejomayi - made of tejas
Ullasini - forth (ut) shining/delighting (lasini)
