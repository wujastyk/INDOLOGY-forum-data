So the _only_ difference between R and R' is that a cluster beginning with
R' does not make the preceding vowel heavy?
Can that R' occur at the beginning of clusters of more than 2 consonants,
and _if_ the answer to that is no, could one analyze the situation as if
for example R'y was not a sequence of two phonemes but one single phoneme?
