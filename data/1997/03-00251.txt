Finishing the second (e.g. the last) volume of the Czech translation of the
novel A Suitable Boy by Vikram Seth, we've encountered some more problems I
hope some of you will be able to help us with.

At first, the translator has asked me to make an inquiry about two places
which could refer to some English texts (so it is not an indological
question today, so if you know about any other better place where to put
this questions, please forward it there).

1. p. 1109 (Chapter 16.7, 2nd page)

	Amit's face grew troubled. 'It's better than spending my life doing
the law like my father and grandfather before me. And the main reason is
that I often like my work when it's done - it's just the doing that is so
tedious. With a short poem there's the inspiration of course. But with this
novel I have to whip myself to my desk - To work, to work, Macbeth doth
shirk.'

Now, does the sentence 'To work, to work, Macbeth doth shirk.' refer to any
generally known piece of English literature?

2. p. 1140 (Chapter 16.20, 2nd-3rd page)


[on a cricket match]
	Pran looked acros at the pavilion section and was completely taken
aback.
	'Oh, Malvolio!' he said, as if he had seen Banquo instead.
	'What was that?' said Haresh.
	'Nothing. I suddenly remembered something I had to teach next term.
Cricket balls, my liege. Something just struck me. No, I - I can't say for
sure that I recognize him - I think you'd better ask the Calcutta people.'


Again, the same. The phrase 'Cricket balls, my liege.' Any suggestions?

Thank you, Jan Dvorak
