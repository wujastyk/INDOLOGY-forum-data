As far as I know the Mora is a metrical schema not following the single 
syllables (longum or breve or anceps) but the short syllable in a bulk, e. 
g. a mora is always breve. In the poetic always the number of Mores is 
important for certain metra, for instance the Arya metre which follows the 
Mora system: in this system  breve breve longum would be 4 Mores. Always 4 
Mores together are 1 gaNa.
So simplified  you could say 1 Mora is a short syllable
In my opinion there is only a sense to speak about Mores when you have a 
quantum of short syllables. More is included into the bulking 
(quantitierende) poetik.
Am I right?
