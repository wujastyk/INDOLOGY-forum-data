In spite of the impressive number of examples in the paper, I am afraid that
abhi has nothing to do with the root bhI (to fear). abhi is related to the
Greek preverb/preposition amphi < *(a)mbhi, compare Latin amb(i)Gallic ambi,
Old High German Umbi and the Albanian preposition mbi. The Sanskrit abhi
comes from a form with another accent pattern than the one in Greek and
Latin, .mbh'i, which in the regular manner of Sanskrit sound change becomes
abhi. (The .m is a vowel in Indo-European). The original concept related to
the word is "on both sides".
