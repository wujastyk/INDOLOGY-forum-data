	The best source for these are not Sanskrit dictionaries per se,
but terminological and administrative dictionaries published by the
various state governments for the regional languages.  The Indian states
are almost all, except perhaps Tamilnadu, involved in developing new
replacement-terminologies in the local language and these are by and large
Sanskritic in their derivation, though modern in their reference.  In many
regions these new terminologies get routinely used especially in the
school textbooks, and through them they become accessible to the new
generations.  Modern Sanskrit simply borrows these terms back into
Sanskrit usage.  The use of newly coined Sanskrit terms for modern
linguistics can be seen in a modern Sanskrit work like Dr. G.B. Palsule's
