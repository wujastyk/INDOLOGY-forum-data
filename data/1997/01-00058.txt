N. Ganesan referred to a conference at Uppsala in Sweden on the Manimekalai. 
Does anyone have more information about this conference?  I am a graduate
student considering doing work on the Manimekalai as part of my dissertation,
and would be interested in hearing from others who have studied or are
studying the epic. Thanks in advance, Katherine Ulrich (keulrich at midway.uchicago.edu).
