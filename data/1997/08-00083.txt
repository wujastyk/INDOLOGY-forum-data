Oh yeah, polyandry is primitive, polygamy less so, lifelong monogamy
is feudal and serial monogamy is the height of civilization.

In RV, Maruts are described as travelling with a single woman,
concieved of as a common wife. This is usually explained in
naturalistic terms, but if ``Nature religion'' is not subscribed
to anymore, should we conclude that the Maruts are not really
`Aryan' gods, but come from a more primitive source?

And, of course, Dumezil had a very different explanation for this.
I have never seen any of those who claim that Draupadi's polyandry is
a sign primitivity to attempt to explain why Dumezil must be wrong.
I am not even sure that many of those even knew what Dumezil had to say.
