Q. identification of scholars
I would suggest:
1. Dr C. Ram Prasad, Trinity College, Oxford. His academic background is in
Western philosophy, but he is also very much interested in study of Hinduism.
2. Dr Anantanand Rambachan, St Olaf College, Minnesota.
Dr Dermot Killingley
Dept of Religious Studies
University of Newcastle upon Tyne
Newcastle upon Tyne NE1 7RU
