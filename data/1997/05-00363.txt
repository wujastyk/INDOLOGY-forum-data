	(You mean sub-caste?)
Yes... if you insist ! 
	I'm confused by the expression "to receive the vedas".
What I meant is that there are groups of Nambudiris, on
the whole a minority, who were traditionally not permitted 
to learn/recite the Vedas.  The explanation given is that 
these groups lost their "purity" at some point in history...
due to their involvement with medicine and healing, martial 
arts etc.
