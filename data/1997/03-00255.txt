SECOND ANNOUNCEMENT

The Institute of Asian and African Studies, Moscow State University, is organizing an International Conference on South Asian Languages on June, 30 - July, 4, 1997. The Organizing committee has decided to widen the initially proposed focal theme, and now we invite papers on various problems of grammatical structure of the languages of South Asia. 
We also decided to shift the time of the conference in order to enable the overseas scholars to participate both in the Moscow conference and in the Oriental Congress to be held in Budapest in early July, 1997. 

Registration fee
The registration fee is US $ 70. This will cover the expenses for lunches, coffee breaks and the printing of the booklet of abstracts. 

Abstracts
The abstracts for publication should not exceed 1000 words . We would like to receive Your abstract by the end of April 1997. We would also appreciate the abstract  being sent via e-mail (one should only keep in mind that e-mail format does not always read all the transliteration symbols). In case You sent the abstract in hard copies please backup them with a floppy disk copy in Word for Windows format.

Hotels
We will try to provide the participants with appropriate hotel  accommodation. Please inform us whether You would like us to do so or whether you are going to make your own arrangements. It is possible to get decent accommodation via the University for approximately 30 US $ per day. Otherwise it is probably much more expensive.

Visas 
Participants are advised to start the visa procedure well in advance. We shall send the questionnaire  form as soon as you contact us.

Please send your application and the abstract to organizing committee: 
do. Lyudmila Khokhlova or doc. Boris Volkhonsky or Alexandre Elizariev.
