Nyayabhashya encoding
     Dear collegues,
I work on encoding the Nyayabhashya to make its electronic version. I would like to
place  this  version on the indological  server but I don't know how to. I will be very 
grateful  for any useful information.
Now first five Nyayasutras with commentary are encoded (font is roman) and first ah-
nika of the first adhyaya will be finished till june.
    Thanks in advance,
                              Yours Tattvarthi,  tat at quel.stu.neva.ru
