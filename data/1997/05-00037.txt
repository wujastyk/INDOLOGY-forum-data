pronounce it voiceless. From the facts that
(1) both /h/ and /H/ were described as glottal
(2) /H/ was recognized as having a velar allophone
(3) it was important to keep /h/ distinct from /.h/ by being voiced
I deduce that it would have been OK to pronounce /h/ as a voiced velar
fricative. I do agree that the [braxman] mostly heard from Scandinavians
and Germans sounds ugly!
Incidentally I trained myself to pronounce /h/, /H/ and all aspirates etc.
in the prescribed way, only to find that they became inaudible to my
teacher, who reprimanded me! I swiftly switched back to /Q/ and /x/, and he
at least did not comment on these pronunciations. To this day I don't know
if anyone really notices that I make a distinction...
