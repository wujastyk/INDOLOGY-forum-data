Subject: The Number Nine
Message-ID: <161227030335.23782.2920478617198754785.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

The number nine was of great importance in ancient China as well as it
represented the heavenly regions.  More recently, in the time of Timur,
most royal gifts were made in nines.  Did Chinese and Indians discover the
mathematical qualities of nine independently, or did ancient central asian
tribes take this idea with them wherever they went?
