Dear Members,
I have been and will be working on a 'multimedia presentation / publication' on
INDIAN WIDOWS. In very short, I plan to combine the results of anthropological
fieldwork, a literature study, slides/photography and video in a multimedia
production (apart from presenting the 'ingredients' separately).
In connection with this plan, I would be grateful for some help:
ON WIDOWS:
* I collect as much information (scientific, historical, novels etc.) on Indian
widows as possible. If you have references, that would be very helpful.
* I would like to have addresses of organizations (NGO's etc) in India working
for/with Indian widows. I would like to visit several organizations and learn
about their experiences.
ON MULTIMEDIA:
By combining text, graphics, images, souns, animation and video, multimedia can
provide a strong and efficient way of transmitting information. I would like to
know from people having experience in the field of multimedia, whether there
are good reference guides on multimedia productions.
Thanks in advance for your help,
With kind regards,
Mirjam
