We do not have the addresses of any of these scholars but the
following information might be of some use.

A work of K. Parameswara Aithal was published by Motilal Banarasidass
and a work of Boris Oguibenine was published by Bhandarkar Oriental
Research Institute. The respective publishers should be able to
give the desired addresses.
