Dear Indologists,
	The name of the eldest pAndava seems to be 'steady in the fight'
but he's not a great warrior as bhIma or arjuna ...
	Can we understand this nominal compound as 'steady about the
fight', hence 'not giving way to the violence', the 'i' in yudhi- being
perhaps an ancient low grade dative ? Are other names or words ending by
-sthira ?
	Advices and/or references would be welcomed. Thanks in advance,
Dominique
