VYAKARAN: Re: Speaking in Sanskrit
Well, Edwin, I don't know what "speaking double-Dutch" means exactly, and I
don't know Arabic either, but my guess is that "speaking in Sanskrit" in
Arabic means "uttering mantras", since that is what Sanskrit is famous for
around the globe...no?  cf. "mandarin" [= mantrin], etc.
