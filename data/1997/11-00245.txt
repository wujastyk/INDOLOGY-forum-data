 Bh. Krishnamurti had "comparative linguistics" instead of " ..... "
 but his characterization applies to much what has been going on in
 INDOLOGY over the past year or so.
 Did members notice that many of the professionals have simply shut up and
 kept away?
 Why? - No one wants to waste time in re-inventing the wheel or engage in
 inane debates (Holi,India & Greeks, German Indology, Kratylos type
 etymologies, IE & semitic roots,  potters & stupas, etc. etc.)
