Celebrations of Milleniums
If you mean apocalyptic ideas, it would be surprising to find a connection
to any of the 'historical' eras, such as the Shaka one.  Escathological
concerns would be linked to the yuga system of chronology, the Puranic
version of which describes the current Kali yuga as lasting 432 000 years,
starting in 3,102 BCE.  However, the equivalent of current Western
apocalytic preoccupations related to the millenium is the idea that the Kali
yuga is coming to an end and a new Satya yuga is dawning.  Many modern
movements claim that this is currently taking place.
