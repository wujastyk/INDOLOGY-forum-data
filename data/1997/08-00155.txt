In my reply earlier today, I absentmindedly erred on a page reference:

for (JN 2nd ed.49.18-50.19, quoting NyAyakaNikA Pandit ed. 136.4-137.8 = my
dissertation 527.526.7-530.5), please read (JN 2nd ed.49.18-50.19, quoting
NyAyakaNikA Pandit ed. 136.4-137.8 = my dissertation 526.7-530.5)

I should also have given the dissertation reference: "VidhivivekaH" of
MandanamizraH, with commentary, "NyAyakaNikA," of VAcaspatimizraH, and
supercommentaries, "JuSadhvaGkaraNI" and "SvaditaGkaraNI," of ParamezvaraH,
critical and annotated edition: the pUrvapakSaH (University of
Pennsylvania, 1988). I hope to have the whole work (pUrvapakSaH, and
uttarapakSaH) ready to send off to a publisher in the spring of 1988.
