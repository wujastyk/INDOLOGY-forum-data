Dear Members of the List
                        Some time back Kamal Adhikary had asked for
information on Study India Programs. Our University is starting one
in 1998. Here is some information about it which may of interest to
some of you.
                              STUDY INDIA PROGRAMS
                         AT THE UNIVERSITY OF HYDERABAD
                                Beginning in 1998


        0. About the University

             The University of Hyderabad (UofH) in India, located in  the
        historic  capital  city of Andhra Pradesh, is one  of  the  dozen
        premier  universities of post-graduate teaching and  research  in
        the  country, and is easily regarded as one of the best  academic
        institutions  in  South Asia. The  UofH  was  the  first  Central
        University  to be established in 1974 in the culturally and  lin-
        guistically rich southern part of India. Located on a serene  and
        green  campus miles away from the hustle and bustle of  the  city
        life,  and  yet  in an institution ideally  suited  for  pursuing
        serious  learning  programs,  this  relatively  young  University
        outstretches its arm to all those who are looking for an exciting
        study abroad program of a short duration. A detailed brochure can
        be had from the O.S.D., Centre for Distance Education, University
        of  Hyderabad, Hyderabad 500046.

             The advantages of locating a special program of this kind in
        Hyderabad are many - its rich linguistic and cultural  tradition,
        salubrious  climate all the year round, concentration  of  educa-
        tional  institutions (five major Universities and three  institu-
        tions  deemed to be universities), and its connectivity  both  by
        air  and  rail/road with many principal cities of  the  country.

             UofH  has  218-odd faculty of the University,  including  70
        Professors, 75 Readers and 73 Lecturers - with a high publication
        profile  (496  books and 3,757 research papers in   National  and
        International  journals in the last 20 years), and with many  na-
        tional and international awards and honours in different  fields.
        So  far, about 6,000 candidates have been awarded degrees of  the
        University including 384 Ph.D. degrees, 1,561 M.Phil. (=Pre-Ph.D.
        research degree after Master's) degrees and 346 M.Tech.  degrees.
        Besides, it has produced about 4,415 post-graduate students.  The
        present teacher-student ratio is quite favourable: 1:8.


        1. The Focus:  The  STUDY  INDIA  PROGRAM of  the  University  of
        Hyderabad  focuses  on India. It has a special  emphasis  on  the
        HERITAGE, CONTINUITY AND CHANGE in India. The program is  created
        as an extension of STUDY ABROAD program available in many Univer-
