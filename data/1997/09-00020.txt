Q: mArjArahatyA
(Now that we've beaten the dog to death, what about the cat?)
In a short story that is used by many of us Hindi teachers in the 
intermediate level, "PrAya"scit" by Bhagavati Charan Varma, a cat is 
apparently killed near the beginning of the story. The pandit, who is fat 
and obviously trying to milk this one for all it's worth, tells the 
guilty family that the killing of a cat is as bad as brahminicide. Did 
he, or the Hindi author, just make that up? Is there a source for that in 
nIti"sAstra or dharma"sAstra somewhere? 
Gratefully,
Bob Hueckstedt
PS: I do remember asking this one before, but the members of the list 
always change, so please forgive the repeat.
