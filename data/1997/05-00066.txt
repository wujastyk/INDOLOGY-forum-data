Thoughts on Sanskritization

Shouldn't we be distinguishing between the script used for writing a
language from the language as a spoken entity? Does anyone *pronounce*
gan(g)gaikoNDacOzhan as kan(g)kaikoNTacOzhan? Surely, Tamil speakers
distinguish between k and g in speech, although not in writing. Similarly,
the sounds s and S frequently occur in speech, although the script allows
strictly only for c (e.g. sol/Sol as variants of col). 
Another question - do the old vaTTezhuttu and the older brAhmI used in
southern Indian inscriptions distinguish within a given varga? If yes, at
what period did this change? In other words, did Tamil script drop already
existing signs within a varga, or did Malayalam import additional signs to
extend an existing set? 
This seems to be putting the cart before the horse. It is the old
resistance to excessive use of Sanskrit words that leads to the modern
resistance to include additional letters in the script, not the other way
round. Note that I am not making any value judgments here. It is the Tamil
resistance to excessive use of Sanskrit that has helped it to maintain its
identity to date. Varying degrees of accommodation of and resistance to
words of Sanskrit origin are seen among all south Indian languages.
