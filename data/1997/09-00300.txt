There are some ekaak.sara-ko;sas in Sanskrit which contain lists of
one-phoneme or one-syllable words. Claus Vogel's book on Sanskrit
lexicography should have their list.
That many of these ekaak.sara words have Tantrika or religious meanings is
generally known. Whether one can give truly historical etymologies of them
is something I do not know. One author, probably named ;Sa:nkaraananda,
tried to use the traditional information to decipher the Indus Valley
script.
