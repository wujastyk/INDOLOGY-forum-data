The vina used by Samudragupta is clearly a harp as can be seen from the
coin. As late as to the time of Krishnadevaraya of Vijayanagar it was
necessary to retune the vina for each raga as can be seen from poet
PeddanA's Manucharitra. In that
poem an attendent tells nAyika:

" See, yesterday you were playing NAta with your pointed fingures. You did
not touch the veena again and the strings disturbed by the morning breese
are doling out NAta notes today at the wrong time ( because NAta is not a
morning rAgA). You better retune it to DEzAkshi."

For those people who know telugu the poem starts " vAlArun konagOLLa nI
valasatan vAinchuchO......"

sarma.
