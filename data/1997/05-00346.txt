the gods
Adi Hastings observes:
Well, I never had the good fortune of meeting Max Mueller [7:00 AM is a
little before my time], so I cannot confirm these reports abt his early
morning habits. I did, however, have the opportunity to disagree with Frits
Staal rather frequently. I can report that Frits did a very good job of
concealing his Calvinist upbringing, and making it appear that his views
were based on, of all things, logic, and even pleasure.
So there must be other factors involved besides one's upbringing. One thing
that Frits has always displayed is a willingness to take risks. I have
never disagreed with this methodological principle.
As for Adi Hasting's main point [also S. Krshna's], in general I agree: who
you are will be a factor in what you say, how you think, what your biases
are. But with regard to the Vedas, there is the additional fact that you
have to work *very* hard to make any sense of them.  Frits simply realised
that if you had to work *too* hard, maybe the meaning was not so much in
the Vedas as in you.
Best wishes,
