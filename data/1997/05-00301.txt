Absolutely.  In this respect I am equidistant to remarks by Howard Resnick,
a Lubavitcher Rabbi from New York, or the Pope in Rome.  You could also add
the Dalai Lama, a Candomble priest, an Evangelical Christian preacher, a
Mormon, a shaman, or anyone else you like.
I am neither Catholic nor Jewish (you seem to think I am either, or both!).
I do not belong to any religion so, as far as these things are concerned, I
have no axe to grind.
It did sound like it, though!  While we're at it, if disclosure is called
upon, it would be interesting to know how many of those who jumped into this
discussion to "defend" Howard Resnick have his same religious affiliation.
Otherwise, we can just leave it at that.
