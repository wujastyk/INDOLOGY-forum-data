Bhavanakrama of Kamalasila
Prof. Richard Hayes (rhayes at wilson.lan.mcgill.ca) has translated one of
Kamala"siila's Bhaavanaakrama into English, and it may well be the second
BK. To my knowledge, however, it hasn't been published yet, but Prof. Hayes
may be willing to send you a copy. We worked on that text a few years ago
as part of the 2nd or 3rd year Sanskrit course at McGill.
Now with regard to the first and third BK, would you (or anyone else) be so
kind to post the full bibliography of the translations to which you refer?
I have a copy of Etienne Lamotte's French translation of the third BK and a
brief analysis (in French) of the first BK by Paul Demieville. Both appear
in:
        Demieville, Paul. 1952. Le Concile de Lhasa: une controverse sur le
        quietisme entre bouddhistes de l'Inde et de la Chine au 8ieme siecle de
        l'ere chretienne. Paris: Imprimerie nationale de France.
Is there any other (English or French) translation of the three BK?
