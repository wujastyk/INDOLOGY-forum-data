Encyc of Hinduism
I also received this announcement from Vedams Intl. I looked through it
very hurriedly before consigning it to the circular file. I did notice,
however, that one article is attributed to me, and at that an article that
I cannot recall writing. I hope it is a good one. Maybe it will be deja vu
all over again when I see it. Did anyone else have a similar experience?
