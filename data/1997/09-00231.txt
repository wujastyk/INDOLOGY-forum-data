Sorry, I missed a phrase in a crucial sentence in my previous post on
cevvazhippaN today. The correct version is below.

Read "not in the kural tiripu manner, but according to the vaTTappAlai"
instead of "not ......" in the marked sentence above. cevvazhi is obtained
from neytaliyAzh, by redefining the notes with respect to the minor
second, according to the vaTTappAlai technique, and not by a simple shift
of tonic.
