IE & Semitic roots. Was: Script on excavated terracotta seals              from Harappa deciphered????

Right.
I had in mind PS or classical Arabic when describing the
vowel system, but the fact that vowels are not "significant"
(not part of the meaning) but determined only by morphology
(or a lexical category in the case of nouns)
is pretty much the same for all Semitic languages.
