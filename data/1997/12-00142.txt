        Yes, there are good reasons to have a linguistic technical term
such as "delocutive". But not only for pragmatical purpose and
English/American, poor in derivations and compounds (but 'yes-man'!), don't
show well this reasons.
        That's to explain some irregularities in the words' formation as
Latin 'salvere', French 'saluer' against Latin 'salvare', French 'sauver'.
And, from this point of view, we can reintroduce words such ahaMvAdin,
showing an unusual aham- against the usual mad- for 'aham' compounds.
        Even if a dubious vocative tAra was a wrong track to explain
tArakAmaya, some other words could be derived from vocatives of imperatives
(remember recent posts about bodhi). Were such formations aborded by pANini
?

PS: about 'yes-man', you can compare the funny French equivalent
'beni-oui-oui', an Arabo-French chimera 'son of oui!oui!' (issued from the
Maghreb colonization by the France, but today completely naturalized, the
'beni' beeing understand 'blessed', 'simpleton').
