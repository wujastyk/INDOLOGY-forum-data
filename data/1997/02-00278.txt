Roman transliteration of Indian languages
 2/23/97
Dr. S. Kalyanaraman's idea of roman scripts
for Indian languages is excellent. With each language
experts & scholars agreeing to an accepted transliteration
scheme with diacretical marks.
First, central government has to take a lead and start 
printing their stuff in Roman letters.
