Dirgha-agama,
It is in the Theravada Canon at Udaana 67 
It is also in Shankara's Commentary on the Chandogya Upanishad at 
5.18.2, and in Naiskarmyasiddhi at 2.70. Ramakrishna quotes it on page 
125 of the Gospel of Ramakrishna, and the Persian Sufi Rumi quotes it at 
Mathnawi 3.1259. Take your pick!
