Yet doesn't some of the Skt. literature refer to the yuga sequence also in
a different way at times? I mean, instead of 4-3-2-1 for k.rta, etc. there
would be the first yuga (k.rta), the second (tretA), etc.  If I remember
correctly,  in one of your own previous posts there was a MBh quote that
inverted the colors of the second and third yuga. In this kind of account
of the yuga sequence, of course, the names tretA (etymologically connected
with 3) and dvApara (etymologically connected with 2) are in metathesis, so
to speak.
What's the logic behind one and the other accounts of the yuga sequence?
