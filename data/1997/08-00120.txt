The story according to the MSV tradition is translated by Prof. Schlingloff in 
his life-work dealing with the Ajanta-paintings. There in Ajanta this avadana 
is painted according the MSV-tradition. The tibetan version is translated by 
the Tibetan scholar Lobsang Panglung from Munich in Germany. All works are 
written in German: "Panglung "Die Erz?hlstoffe des Mulasarvastivada-vinaya" 
Tokyo 1981; D. Schlingloff "Zur geschichtlichen Bedeutung der fr?hen Seefahrt" 
Munich 1982. The Ajanta book of Prof. Schlingloff will be published at the end 
of 1997.

(1.18/1.73/13.43/11.37/9.22), also in connection with the root dh.r, further 
instances are to be found in Palicanon.
