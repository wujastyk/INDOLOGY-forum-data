memorization and cosmic order
Dear Indologists: The recent thread over memorization and oral
transmission neglects an importnat aspect of the practice. In Barbara
Holdrege's _Veda and Torah: Transcending the textuality of scripture_,
she argues that "Accurate reproduction of these primal sounds through
periodic recitation and sacrificial preformances is considered essential
for the periodic regeneration and maintenance of the cosminc order....
Conversely, any inaccuracies in either recitation or the sacrificial
ritual are believed to have calamitous effects on the cosmic order."
The upshot is that there was a punishment for inaccurate transmission
of the Vedas. This, of course, doesn't mean that mistakes did not occur,
but it does indicate that people would work hard to get it exactly right
