hair's colour in sanskrit

I think the colour of brass would be to "strong". "Municipality-coloured"
means something that is drab and dreary, the sort of stuff your municipality
might produce when making a public building, or blessing you with public
information in a particularly unappealing brochure. It could probably be
described as light brown shading into grey, and is as I said very
lack-lustre. Beautiful hair has strong, vibrant colours, whether it be
blonde, chestnut or black.
