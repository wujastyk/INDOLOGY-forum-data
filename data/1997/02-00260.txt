Epigraphy
Our University library cannot locate its copy of Konow's KharoSThI 
Inscriptions (Corpus Inscr. Indicarum). Could anybody check, whether it 
contains the so-called Hidda Earthen Jar Inscription of the year 28 
(mentioning the Macedonian month name Apellaios). If it is there, I just 
need the number given to it by Konow to make my reference complete.
Thanks
Klaus
