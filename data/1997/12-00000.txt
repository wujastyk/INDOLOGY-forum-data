rescuing things
Simple suggestion:
Instead of talking, one could simply visit a few villages on one's next
trip to India, -- in B. Misra's case, Orissa, -- and film/photocopy
(important) MSS, make tape recordings of the Vedas, and deposit them at a
local library, say at the Puri Skt. University.
Of course, one could also donate some money to the local MSS Gavesana
Society, at Bhubaneswar.
THAT is how one could respect India's heritage. Not by TALKING,
however fashionable.
