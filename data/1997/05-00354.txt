The lunar month and gestation
According to Charaka SaMhitA, gestation occurs 
thus:
First month -  the discharge of the male 
and female unite.
Second - the unified fluid condenses and
becomes shaped like a kidney bean.
Third  -  The bodily organs are formed.
Fourth - the bones are formed.
Fifth - skin develops around the body.
Sixth - hair develops.
Seventh - knowledge enters the
fetus.
Eighth - The fetus takes nourishment through the
umbilical cord.
Ninth - the desire to be born develops (Udvega).
Tenth  - delivery takes place.
According to certain Indian lore, the sex of the child is 
determined by whether the sexual discharge during union
is greater for the male, resulting in a male child, or the 
female, resulting in a female child.
When you combine this belief with the general desire 
for male offspring, I wonder if this had an adverse
effect on female satisfaction...;)
