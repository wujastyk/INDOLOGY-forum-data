Our library does not hold the volume mentioned below, so I am asking the
esteemed members of this list whether anybody is in possession of a copy
of the following article and would be so kind as to mail one to me: 

V. Varadachari: Conditions for the Rise of Perceptual Cognition. Prof.
Suryya K Bhuyan Commemoration Volume, ed. M. Neog and H.K. Barpujari,
Gauhati 1966, pp.248-251.
