Indian computing?
1. Does anyone know of places on the net where I can find the various
   official specs relevant to computing & Indian languages (ISCII, etc.)
3. What's the 8-bit standard that has the characters needed for translit-
   teration (letters with macrons, underdots, overdots, etc.)? (Incidentally
   does Unicode make room for such characters? where do I find the Unicode
   spec?)
2. Is there a reference book for computing & Indian languages (I'm thinking
   of something along to lines of what Ken Lunde's "Understanding Japanese
   Information Processing" is for Japanese)
Thanks
Jacob
