Korean/Tamil/Hindi (was Re: Query on var.nabheda)
I'm not sure what you mean by complete. They have nearly fifty letters a
piece. They are consonant+vowel combos, (e.g.: na, ni, no, though there are
long vowels that can be added). They are purely alphabetic and have no
semantic significance  beyond their use in constructing phonemes.
