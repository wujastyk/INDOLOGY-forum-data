decipering a colophon
Lists of words used in chronograms are given in:
	1. P. V. Kane, History of Dharmasastra V, pt.1, pp. 701-3.
	2. G. Bu:hler, Indian Paleography..., 84-6.
	3. D. C. Sircar, Indian Epigraphy, pp. 230-3.
These sources (esp. Sircar, who gives ripu = 6) would seem to support your
interpretation of the date in question.  I don't find vairi- in any of the
lists, but it is obviously a synonym of ripu/ari, etc., and hence
presumably also = 6.
