I remember acquiring a font called PCS Nepali once from an archive site,
but I think that it is a commercial font which someone inadvertently
placed at the site thinking it was in the public domain. The quality of
the font was commendable, but once had to manually create a character map
as there was no documentation accompanying it. I've long since deleted it
as I've made myself partial to TeX and it's brilliant devanaagarii
Metafonts.
