Yes, I did not go into other details. It is true that Jaffna Tamil,
Malayalam and Toda preserve the distinctiion of the two r's.I was addressing
the limited question of how to phonetically define and transliterate the
different n's, l's and r's that Ganesan was interested in. In modern spoken
Tamil, word initial n is also an alveolar and not a dental as it is in
Modern Malayalam. In Old Tamil word initial n was described as a dental, as
also the n preceding dental stops; elsewhere it was an alveolar (except for
three words werin, porun, etc.). In spoken Telugu and Kannada also word
initial n is a post-dental/alveolar. Dental n occurs only before dental
stops. For Modern Malayalam we need seperate symbols for dental  n and
alveolar _n/n'.Malayalam is one of the few languages in the world with six
phonemic nasals which may be transliterated in text mode as: bilabial m,
dental n, alveolar _n or n', palatal ~n, retroflex N, velar ,n.
