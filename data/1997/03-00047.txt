decipering a colophon
Indologists,
I have come across the following date mentioned in the colophon of a MS:
ripuvairisaptap.rthvii
I would have read that this as 1766 VS, but the catalogue for the MS says
1733 VS.  
Can anyone clarify the usage of "ripu" and "vairi" as anka?
Is there any reference book for these usages?
Merci d'avance,
Adrian
