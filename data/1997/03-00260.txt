Liberation Philology Software offers full sets of low-cost,
no-nonsense, user-friendly computer programs to help beginning
and intermediate students of a variety of languages master
the basics of grammar and vocabulary.
Each set of programs includes, as appropriate,
full paradigms and drills for all necessary
regular and irregular verbs, declensions of nouns,
and flash-card vocabulary quizzes of hundreds of
basic words derived from standard textbooks
or from frequency analysis of a suitable corpus.
In the self-testing quizzes which follow instruction,
students may alternate between multiple choice tests,
"fill-in-the-missing form" tests, and parsing tests.
Except as noted, the programs run on any DOS (IBM-compatible)
computer or on any Macintosh (or MacOS compatible)
computer (System 6.0.5 or higher).

Each set is individually registered to a single user.
The programs may not be "shared" with others.
