CS Utopia updated
I am trying to use CS Utopia for transcribing tamil. Unfortunately, a few 
signs are missing for that purpose: long e (i.e. e with a stroke above), 
long o (i.e. o with a stroke above), r, l, and n each with a stroke below 
(which can be made with the "underline" function, but it s not very 
nice). Would there be a possibility to get these signs made for CS Utopia?
Thanks, ULRIKE.
