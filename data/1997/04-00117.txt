Call for co-op: webpage on different standards of  transcription/transliteration
(Apologies to those that get more than one copy of this message!)
Dear friends,
I'm preparing a webpage dealing with transcription of various scripts and
languages, as well as phonetic notation, in ASCII and HTML. Any suggestions
and/or pointers to existing standards/proposals/existing habits are most
welcome. ALL languages and scripts are of interest.
Thank you,
Philip Jonsson <bpj at netg.se>
