Help!
Dear netters!
I need page 247 from Aula Orientalis 7, 1989, which is not available here in
Oslo. Is there a kind and benevolent soul out there in Cyberspace who would
make a copy of the page and fax it to me? (Fax. no. +47 22 32 12 19).
(His/her punya will increase dramatically!)
Best regards,
Lars Martin Fosse
