But wasn't it Tilak's opinion that the ayanas were defined by the equinoxes
instead of the solstices?   I don't have Tilak's book with me, but,
according to Macdonell $ Keith (Vedic Index 1:529-539; 2:467,n.21) that was
his interpretation.
This interpretation, by the way, has no support in Vedic literature.
Nevertheless, there are translators who seem to have accepted it, such as
Ganguly/Roy (Mbh. vol.9:167-168) and Pargiter (the Markandeya Purana, p. 226).
