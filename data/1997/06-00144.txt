Experiences with D. K. Agencies
Dear Tina,
In case you missed this. If you can't get on the web site (which seems to
deal with books in English), perhaps you could send e-mail to him.
Glad to hear that you are going to Europe with your daugther. This is the
sort of activity that both of you will be completely natural doing (or you
aren't doing it right.)
