I didn't know that blockprinting of books was employed in India. Are these
books similar to Tibetan blockprinted books, and if so is there any actual
technical historical connection? One always hears that the Tibetans learned
blockprinting from China, and from what I've been able to gather the
technique used in Tibetan and Korean blockprinting is identical, which
should indicate a Chinese origin.
