For what interest it may have, there is currently a strong push by the Sri
Vaishnavas (Jeeyar Swami) to get rid of the word Hindu and replace it with
either Vedic or Bharata. He said that the word, Hindu, came in to use
during the period of Parsi rule and was used as a negative term, [perhaps
not literally meaning, but at least] implying the characteristic of all
those people that were not believers in the Parsi religion of the time. He
thinks it is quite strange that the people of India continued to use it
afterwards and in trying to get them to stop. For example, he is
encouraging groups like the "Hindu Society" or "Hindu Temple" to change
their name to Vedic Temple or Vedic Society, etc.
