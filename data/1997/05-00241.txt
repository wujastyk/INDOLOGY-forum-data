Leitner was *deputed by the Panjab Government in 1866 on a mission of
linguistic enquiry to Kashmir and Chilas, late on special duty with the
Government of India in the Foreign Department*. His main contributions
are: The Languages and Races of Dardistan, Lahore 1877 (3 parts)
The Hunza and Nagyr Handbook, Calcutta 1887 and Dardistan in 1866, 1886
and 1893: beeing an account ...., Woking 1894 (repr. Karachi 1985).
There should be biographical notes in books on Hunza and the Burushaski
language.
