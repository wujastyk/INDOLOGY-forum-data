Science and beliefs (was: the gods)

	I agree completely. Using Eliade's definition of a religion as
'founding the reality' it's clear the science is today a new sort of living
religion, with cosmogony, origin of life, of mankind, gods (Energy,
Entropy, &c.), sacred and hermetic language (mathematics), well-developped
magic (technology, flying, far-talking, fireballs, &c.), necromancy (old
movies, archeology), clerics (I'm one) with studies, initiation, hierarchy
and heretics (I'm one too) and underlying philosophy (the concept of the
world's modelisation by scientific theories is platonician). The science is
apostolic (a subtle form of neo-coloialism) but, perhaps, the main today's
problems come from his lack of an eschatology!
	I don't agree fully: translating a text is not just translating
words, syntax and semantic but translating too the *pragmatic*. A law-text
must be translated by a law-man. A religious text is not like a novel, it
vehicles strong religious intentions and I prefer the translator of a
buddhist text to be a buddhist. The exceptions are dead religions (as
egyptian one) and too much evolued religions: are bad translated Bible by a
protestant or Veda by an hinduist! (warning: I'm saying they are bad
translated from philological point of view, not from translator's religious
one). And if I recall right, muslim law prohibes the translation of Coran.
