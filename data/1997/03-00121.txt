Indo-Germanic

It's still remarkable that someone invented the word "Indo-Germanic" and
nobody came up with "Indo-Dutch", "Indo-Irish" or "Indo-Italian". If it's a
nazi-word, then it shouldn't be used anymore. If not then it still is a sign
of blunt and naieve nationalism. And maybe some people could be tempted to
jump to conclusions. There have been quite a few German philosophers, like
f.i. Martin Heidegger, who really believed that the German people were "das
metafysische Volk" and the true heirs of ancient Greek civilisation. Some of
those have still followers today. I would rather not be forgiving about it,
better safe than sorry. Let's drop the word.
