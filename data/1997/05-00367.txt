a simple (silly?) question (was Re: Metric Melodies)
Yet that subgroup of the Nambudiris are still considered
to be brahmans? In other words the statement that the first
three varnas are permitted to learn the vedas (whereas
shudras are not) is an oversimplification, as in fact there can
be subgroups of the first three varnas who also were not taught
the vedas?
