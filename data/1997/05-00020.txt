Bitstream charter csx font and Word 97
I have been try to use the unicode settings on Word 97 however I haven't managed to figure out how to get them to work for diacritics used for Indian transcription. Basically the Lucinda Sans Unicode provided with Word 97 has the possibility of using Latin 1, Latin 2, (New) Greek, Cyrillic, Turkish, Baltic and Hebrew, and when openning up the font I found that it also has some extended Cyrillic (Old Church Slavonic), but it was missing classical Greek, Arabic, and certain necessary diacritics for Indian language transliteration (although there are diverse phonetic characters). The problem is, naturally, how to get these to work on the keyboard. When working on my Pan-European platform, as an experient, I managed to play around with the registry to include Hebrew, and them I made a keyboard driver that very nicely "opens up" the Hebrew in Lucinda Sans, with the problem remaining of the right to left cursor. Presumeable something similar could be done for Indian transliteration. There is a problem, however, in that their are no code pages (as far as I know) predicted for classical languages - Sanskrit, Ancient Greek and even Latin. For Latin I have basically been using the Baltic setting, since they include macrons.

Actually Windows 97 contains much better support for Unicode
than Windows 95 and - when applications are available to 
take advantage of it - you should be able to easily generate *all*
the diacritics necessary for transliterating Indian scripts
as well as those scripts themselves in Windows 97.
Windows 97 supports all the Unicode character pages 
not just the WGL4 sub set that was intoduced with Win 95.
As for fonts not working - many font development tools 
generate poor quality TrueType fonts or fonts with 
missing table information. Some of these tables were not
required by Windows 3.1x or Windows '95 (although they 
have been in the spec for years).
Windows 97 requires some of these additional tables and
if fonts have been made without them they may not work.
Word 97 does contain Unicode support. 
Microsoft seem to be developing add on language packs for most
Unicode scripts and languages which will be available for 
Windows 97 & NT 5. AFAIK these language-packs should contain
fonts for the appropriate script(s) and a keyboard driver and 
it it will be possible to switch bettween installed IME's / keyboard 
layouts /scripts/ fonts on the fly.
To make Microsoft aware of the demand for an add-on language
pack and fonts to handle the diacritics used in
transliterating Indic scripts it might be a good idea for as
many institutions and individuals as possible to  contact
"Nadine Kano" <nadinek at microsoft.com> and "F. Avery Bishop"
<averyb at microsoft.com> of Microsoft's Globalization group.
I have also found David Meltzer <davidm at microsoft.com>
of their Typography group to be very helpful regarding 
difficulties with fonts etc..
