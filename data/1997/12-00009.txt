Tripurasundari
I have given one historical answer in my paper "The coming of the Aryans to
Iran and India and the cultural and ethnic identity of the Daasas",
published in Studia Orientalia vol. 64, 1988, pp. 195-302. See especially
the chapters entitled "The goddess and the fort" (pp. 256-259) and "The
'autumnal fort' and Zambara" (pp. 259-264).
