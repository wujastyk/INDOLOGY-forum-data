book Yubhaata.h sa.msk.rta.m prati ("From IE to Sanskrit").  Sanskritic or
pseudo-Sanskritic terms were used in Marathi science textbooks when I was
in school.  Thus, our textbooks used praa.navaayu for oxygen, natravaayu
for nitrogen, karba-dvi-praa.nila-vaayu for Carbon-di-oxide, etc.  I
remember modern Sanskrit use of these terms on some occasions.  The same
happens with respect to administrative/civic terms like loka-sabhaa,
raajya-sabhaa, vidhaana-sabhaa etc.  One can hear these terms routinely
used in Sanskrit on the daily All India Radio news broadcasts.
