Chinese texts often refer to Buddhist teachers as tsang-shih (zangshi, for
the pinyiners), (tri-)pitaka master. Other types of titles are fa-shih,
Dharma-masters; sha-men (Shaman, early on used for Buddhist monks), etc. I
don't know the origin of these terms, except that they were used regularly
by the 4th century. Occasionally the full san-tsang-shih (tripitaka master)
is used.
