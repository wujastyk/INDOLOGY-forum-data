        2. Why join SIP at UofH?
             There  are  many reasons as to why one may do  SIP  at  this 
        University  other than the variety or attractive  (and  variable) 
        fee structure. These are the distinct advantages:
        * Internationally acclaimed/honored faculty
        * A large number of faculty have research experience abroad
        * Many teachers have been visiting professors abroad
        * SIP has a modular structure - extremely flexible
        * SIP will surely be a value-addition program for its takers
        * SIP at the UofH is quite economical with a flexible tuition fee
          related  to the credits earned and to the  parent  University's
          pattern
        * A polution-free naturally endowed campus with about 1000 hect.
        * One of the few Universities in India where the Semester  system
          has been followed so rigorously in the last two decades
        * A fully computerized library (the first of its kind in  India)
        * A well-equipped computer centre networked to all schools
        * E-mail/internet facilities (not readily available elsewhere)
        * A heterogeneous campus with already some international students      
        * Well-connected campus away from the hustle of city life
        3. Accreditation: The courses being offered as listed here  range  
        from   levels  2000 to 6000 equivalents, and accordingly 2  to  6 
        credits could be earned by the students attending them from their 
        parent  Universities.  It is, however,  possible  that  different 
        Universities abroad will recognize different sets of these cours-
        es  and may ask its students to opt for some among them. 
        4. Specialized Program: The list of courses as described in  this 
        chapter is only indicative of what the University can offer.  But 
        if necessary, the University can create specialized programs  and 
        packages  of  courses for particular countries  or  participating 
        Universities.
             Teaching  will include lectures, tutorials (by doctoral  and 
        post-doc  students/Teaching Assistants), discussions,  practicals 
        or  hands-on  experience),  seminars,  field-work, take-home  and 
        other  assignments,  project  reports, and a  week-long  trip  to 
        different  parts  of India (at least, South India).  For  certain 
        courses,  audio-video  component and performances  will  also  be 
        employed.   Evaluation  here will  include  teacher   evaluation,  
        peer   evaluation as well as for feed-back, course-evaluation  to 
        be done by students.         
             Advanced reading lists to be made available so that partici-
        pating students can come with some preparation. In most cases, an 
        orientation  is  expected to be organized  by  the  participating 
        Universities  from  abroad. But a week-long  orientation  can  be 
        organized by this University, too under a special arrangement.
        5.  Timing: At the moment, the courses are being organized  on  a 
        quarter pattern (10 weeks of course-work followed by two weeks of 
        field  tour/trips),  beginning three times a year  -  around  the 
        second  week of January, June and September every year.  However, 
        these could also be offered on a semester pattern of 16 weeks  of 
        teaching and two weeks of trips and tours.
        6. Quantum of Options at a given time: The maximum credits possi-
        ble  to  earn  in a given quarter will vary between  12  and  16. 
        Depending  on registration and faculty availability  (which  fact 
        could   be  checked  easily  through  e-mail  with  the   Program 
        Director), at least six courses are to be offered every quarter.
        7. Quantum of Students under SIP:  While  there is  theoretically 
        no upper limit of students admitted under SIP, it is not expected 
        to be a crowded program. The idea is to take special care of each 
        student.  But it is expected that the participating  Universities  
        will send at least 5 to 10 students for a particular quarter. For 
        a course to be viable, there must at least be 3 to 4 registrants.
        8.  Teaching  medium, methods and evaluation: The medium  of  in-
        struction  will  be English in which  proficiency  is  essential. 
        Teaching  will include lectures, tutorials, discussions,  practi-
        cals,  seminars,   field-work, take-home and  other  assignments, 
        project  reports, and a week-long trip to places of interest. 
        9.  Orientation/Preparatory  Help: Advanced reading lists  to  be 
        made available so that  students can come with some preparation. 
        10.  Who can apply?: The program is aimed at   overseas  students 
        from  all countries provided they meet the general  pre-requisite 
        of proficiency in English and special pre-requisites, if any. The 
        following could be possible applicants:
        * Universities and their International Studies divisions
        * Study Abroad Program Directors of Universities & Colleges
        * Heads of Academic Programs or Departments of Universities
        * Universities with South Asia/Area Studies program
        * Individual students could also  apply, but  getting  accredita-
          tion will be their own responsibility
        * Higher  Education  Institutes or Ministries of Education
        * NRI groups or associations could also send in  requests
        * Trade or Business delegations or groups (for crash courses)
        * Foreign scholars/technocrats already in India could also apply
        * Individuals who may only wish to audit or attend courses
        11. A Modular Structure: The SIP has been envisaged as a  Modular 
        Program with three modules - the first one being introductory and 
        panoramic, where either of these courses could be given:
                  Level 2000 ; No.1-200 INDIA TODAY (Credits: 2)
                  Level 3000 ; No.1-300 INDIAN CULTURAL HERITAGE  (Cr: 2)
        All the courses described above could be arranged under both  12-
        week  module (10 weeks of teaching plus 2 weeks of  India-travel) 
        [=MODULE 3] or  five- to six-week  MODULE 2 upon request. 
        12.  Fee  Structure: Tuition fee payable by a student  will  have 
        four components:
        (1) Tuition fee, if any,  payable to the parent University:   [?]  
        (2) TUITION payable to UNIVERSITY OF HYDERABAD:       US  $ 2,000
            [or, roughly US $150 to US $160 per credit; however,
            for the students paying higher fee  to their  parent
            University, the UofH tuition will be higher/negotiable]
            * For non-degree participants/For auditing   :    US  $ 1,000
            * For the NRI-groups sponsoring a candidate  :    US  $ 2,000  
        (III) International and within India Travel & Visa cost: Variable
        (IV) Boarding & Lodging/Misc./Local transport :[Approx] US $  800
             To summarize, including air-fare, the candidates are expect-
        ed to spend about US $ 4,300 for a SIP quarter.
