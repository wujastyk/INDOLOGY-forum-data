AREA STUDIES COLLECTIONS and PROGRAMS FOR SCHOLARS

A special program of the US Library of Congress

Saturday, February 15, 1997
2:00-4:00pm
Hispanic Reading Room (LJ-205)
Thomas Jefferson Building
Library of Congress
Washington, DC

In 1997, three area studies divisions of Library of Congress (Asian,
European, and African and Middle Eastern) will be joining a fourth
division (Hispanic) in new reading rooms in the Thomas Jefferson Building.
Come and hear about plans for these remarkable collections in their
resplendant new quarters. Learn about the Federal Research Division, which
produces the popular "country studies" books. Get a briefing on special
research opportunities at the Library of Congress and the projects of
Scholars Programs. Selected items of unique interest from the area studies
collections will be displayed, and informational brochures made available.
