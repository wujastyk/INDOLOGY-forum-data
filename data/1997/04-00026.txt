This interesting curiosity has inspired a modern play in Kanna.da by my
brother Wasant Kawali, prducer of drama at All-India radio. The play is
entitled "bere ko?ca madhu pAtrakke hAki". It was published on or before
1975 in Bangalore. It was enacted around the same date in Bangalore, Hassan
etc. In the play the Greek words are interpreted as hale kanna.da. It is
the story of Greek sailors reaching the port of Malpe. The action takes
place there. The theme is the love of a Greek girl with a local chieftain,
Malpe NAyaka.
Attempts to interpret the words of the greek play in Tulu have been done
several times. See Saletore, History of Tuluva.
