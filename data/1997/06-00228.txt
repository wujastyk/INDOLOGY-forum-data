The article you are referring to was not published in the
Proceedings, it appeared only in the "Summaries of Papers". I am
relying here on: 
	K.V. Sarma: Index of Papers submitted to the All-India
	Oriental Conference. Sessions I to XII (1919-1944). Poona
	1949, p. 127: "(summary) [Vol.] V, 23".
You will find a very sketchy bibliography of Kunhan Raja's works in the
Kunhan Raja Presentation volume of 1946. There are many contributions
to Vedic interpretation and/or commentators listed but at first sight
I couldn't find anything similar to "accent and meaning".

I am not sure if there was published a Kunhan Raja commemoration volume
(perhaps in Adyar Library Bulletin?), if it was it possibly contains a
better bibliography.

Hoping you'll find better references
