To the best of my knowledge, there is nobody in Gokarna who knows the
Saunakiya AV, or any other AV "saakhaa. And I would venture to guess the
same is the case in Varanasi. A few vaidikas may know a few mantras, but
the last of the "Saunakiiyas, in Gujarat, may be gone by now (to fiveness).
A taperecording of this text was made several years ago (in Gujarat) by the
Tirupati Devasthanam and is on file there, though it is virtually
impossible to get (I have tried). The IGNCA also has a copy of this
recording, but the procedural problems there are nearly as forbidding. I am
currently working on a proposal which would enable copying the material in
Tirupati. (Ask me in a year what has come of it).
