Explanation for 'SaDja'
S Krishna wrote:
In *A Descriptive Catalogue of the Sanskrit Manuscripts of the Government
Oriental Manuscripts Library, Madras. By the Late M. Seshagiri Sastri. Vol.
I, Vedic Literature, First Part. Madras 1901.* on page 76, there is explained
that there are seven notes in the chanting of the sAmaveda and that these
seven notes correspond to the notes of the gamut of Hindu music in the
following way:
prathama ..... madhyama
dvitIya........gAndhAra
tRtIya.........RSabha
caturtha.......SaDja
pancama........dhaivata
SaSTa..........niSAda
saptama........pancama
Then, there are quoted two verses of the nAradazikSA:
yaH sAmagAnAM prathamaH veNor madhyama? smRtaH
yo *sau dvitIyo gAndhAraH tRtIyas tv RSabhaH smRtaH
caturthaH SaDja ity AhuH pancamo dhaivato bhavet
SaSTo niSAdo vij?eya? saptama? pancamaH smRtaH.
I hope, this is of any help
