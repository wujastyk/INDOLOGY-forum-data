Yogavasistha
As regards the YV?s concept of akasa - basically expressing the idea 
of space[-like emptiness] -, it has been treated by me in a monograph 
entitled:
	Walter Slaje, Vom Moksopaya-Sastra zum 
	Yogavasistha-Maharamayana. Vienna 1994.
References to cid-akasa etc. can be found by using the index.
Kindly regarding, W. Slaje
