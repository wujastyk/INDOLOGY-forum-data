Subject: Macdonell's dictionary - what's the correct title?
Message-ID: <161227029982.23782.156647962192485614.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I have 2 names for Macdonell's small (about 400 pp.)
dictionary at OUP: "A Sanskrit Dictionary for Students"
and "A Practical Sanskrit Dictionary". Which one is the
correct one? (Or are we talking about 2 different ones?)

Thanks
Jacob
