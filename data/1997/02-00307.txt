We are currently in the process of changing list servers from listproc to listserv. At 
the moment there is a shadow version of the Indology list of subscribers under 
listserv. This is there for us test various things. Therefore, at the present time the 
real version of the list is the one managed by listproc. This has several 
consequences:
1) You need to advise potential subscribers to use the listproc address. We're 
starting to see new users trying to subscribe via listserv - this won't get them any 
email at the present time.
2) Any change in subscription options need to be sent to listproc.
3) Signoff requests must go to listproc. Again, we're seeing existing members of the 
list using the listserv address. A signoff to listserv will remove you from the shadow 
but won't stop any emails.
