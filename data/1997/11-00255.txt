I have read S.Krishna's posting and do not find any thing offensive or

appreciate the sentiments expressed there. I do not understand all this talk
of demonising Tamil or Tamil Scholars. I do not have in my mailbox any
posting of Sri Palaniappan dealing with the linguistic part of S.Krishna's
posting. I think Sri Ramalingam is refering to some private communication.
I do not consider the word Pro-Sanskrit as a demeaning or degrading term.
We do not belong to Veera Dravidian sect to think that everything
Dravidian is good everything Aryan is bad.
