I mentioned this discussion to a friend of mine, who is a Baroque (sp?)
violinist. Although himself a vegetarian he goes to great hardships to
obtain gut strings, because he feels that their "sound" is significantly
different from that of wire strings, and more "original". He wondered if
this difference in sound have any role wrt to the choice of string material
in Indic music?
