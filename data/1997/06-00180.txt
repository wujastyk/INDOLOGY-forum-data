Not a mass but Allegri's "Miserere". A few pages of music.

Although this particular feat is considered to be true, much
Mozart folklore is pure myth though, and there's no evidence
that Mozart had a so called "photographic memory". Music is
highly structured material and Mozart's excellent musical memory
seem to have had to do more with his musical capacities of
analysis and his ability to grasp structure than with purely
mechanical feats of memory.
