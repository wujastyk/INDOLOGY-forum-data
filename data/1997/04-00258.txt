Rig Veda, ta'ntra, nUl, and sUtra
Thank you for this reference.  The phonic, morphological, and semantic
similarity of UrNavAbhi and UrNanAbhi caught my attention too.  But the
point is that the form UrNavAbhi displays a nice cognate of the Avestan
root vaf-, uf-, "to weave, sing".  Thus, no chasm at all between Old
Iranian and Old Indic re this verbal root.
Perhaps with a lot of hard work we can get to the bottom of this problem.
Best wishes,
George Thompson
