Thank you for this reference.  The phonic, morphological, and semantic
similarity of UrNavAbhi and UrNanAbhi caught my attention too.  But the
point is that the form UrNavAbhi displays a nice cognate of the Avestan
root vaf-, uf-, "to weave, sing".  Thus, no chasm at all between Old
Iranian and Old Indic re this verbal root.

Perhaps with a lot of hard work we can get to the bottom of this problem.

Best wishes,
George Thompson
