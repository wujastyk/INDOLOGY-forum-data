	In this regard, could someone comment on any possible relationship between
the Brhaspati linked to Carvaka, politics, hedonism etc., and the Brhaspati
of the Mahabharata, Bhagavat-purana, etc., i.e. the father of Kaca, the guru
of Indra, etc? This Brhaspati, in order to advise the gods, was presumably
learned in political science, but is not linked to hedonism. Is this supposed
to be the same person?
Thank you.
