Since you mention Vaiyapuri Pillai,
you should also say that the date he proposes
for _tolkAppiyam_ is the second half of the 5th century A.D.
(see his _History of Tamil Language and Literature_, P.48,
 second revised edition, 1988, NCBH, Madras)
which is 600 years later than pataJjali
whereas Zvelebil tries to explain that there is an original
version of _tolkAppiyam_ which is pre-cangam
and a final editing and redaction which took place
in the 5th Cent. A.D.
(see _The Smile of Murugan_, 1973, Leiden, E.J. Brill, P.143-146,
where he gives his "first conclusion" and his "second,
but not [...]final conclusion" on the date of _tolkAppiyam_)
