rescuing things
Indian governmnet has extractive policies such as in Ethnobotany research.
iN THSI OPROGRAM TRIBAL AND LOCAL KNOWLEDGE OF PEOPLE IS COLLeCTED BUT
ARCHIVED IN FORMAL SCIENTIfIC INStITUTES AND NOT MADE AVAILBLE TO LOCAL
COMMUNITIES ON CASSETS ( ORAL HIStory) or in print form
we know that literacy levels and drop out rates are highest in regions with
highest diversity ( cultural as well as biological).
I do feel that we need to have a comprehensive initiative in Voluntary
sector in which local art, literature and folk history etc., are recorded
and mae avaoilbale to local communities to foster lateral learning as well
as for future geenrations.
To me any research which is not fed back to those who provided data in
their language is unethical. At least that is my position and I do not want
to pass judjments on nay body else's morals.
We shoudl not look up to governmnets. Literature will survive not just by
Indology insitutes but by keeping it alive as a subject of discourse.
