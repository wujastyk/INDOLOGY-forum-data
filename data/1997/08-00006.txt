Text references on 'kalasha/ kumbha/ ghaTa'
The poet Bhartrihari speaks of comparing breasts to golden jugs
(kanakakalasha) in one of the poems from the Vairagya shataka.  In D.D.
Kosambi's edition of the Shatakatrayam it is poem number 159.  The text
runs as follows:
stanau maa.msagranthii kanakakalashaav ity upamitau
	mukha.m shle.smaagaaram tad api ca shashaankena tulitam
sravanmuutraklinna.m karivarakaraspardhi jaghanam
	aho nindya.m ruupa.m kavijanavishe.sair guru k.rtam
Though this is obviously not a ritual text, perhaps it will be of some use
to you?
