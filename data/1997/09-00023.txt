Sigh!  Wouldn't it be *great* if indological writings had any commercial
value whatsoever that was worth protecting!  The above message gave me a
wonderful fleeting vision of industral espionage, bidding wars between
great corporations, and seductive blandishments offered by dark-suited
emmissiaries from the military-industrial complex, all focussed on a
sleek, leather briefcase containing a single sheet of A4 describing the
workings of a Paninian sutra.

If only.  :-)

All the best,
Dominik
