the root of the ear
Monier-Williams, p. 401, defines cuulaka as "the root of an elephant's ear". 
Does anyone happen to know precisely what this is? Queries to other native 
speakers of English, American and British, yielded only bemusement. I 
presume it to mean the place where the external ear is attached to the scalp. 
Any suggestions would be much appreciated.
Thank You,
