Shiva is the only God in the Hindu Pantheon, who can face all  directions in Temple Architecture. With the exception of Shiva, all Gods do not face the South - as it is the direction of the God of Death - Yama. Shiva, on the other hand faces this direction as Dakshinamurti - The Great Teacher - who dispels ignorance and spreads knowledge all over the world.

If your referring to the Shiva _lingam_, its of course difficult to tell
where the "face" is, except in stylised representations.
In Bengal (esp. the Dakshineswar Kali Temple, made famous by Sri
Ramakrishna Paramahamsa), all of the (12) Shiva temples, as well as the
lingam in the shrine are positioned so that the _yoni_ "points" towards the
north. And the current head pujari at the temple is quite insistent that
this is the correct way for all Shiva lingams to be situated. I couldn't
tell you whether this custom holds true in other places...
Hope this helps,
