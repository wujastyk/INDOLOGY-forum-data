I am working on a translation of Some Vedic Sanskrit Texts and was
looking for any resources that deal specifically with Vedic Grammar and
Syntax.  Right now I mostly use AA MacDonell's A Vedic Grammar, and Sir
M. Monier Williams Dictionary,  Any other recommendations for vedic work?
 Also have any dictionaries been entered into computerized format.  I'm
looking especially for Moniers and any other's that may be useful for
vedic work.
