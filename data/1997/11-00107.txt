Dear Colleagues,
I am now faced with a peculiar set of consultation queries, and
haven't got a clue as to how to proceed, or which sources to
consult. Any ideas of suggestions will be greatly appreciated. The
query is extracted below.

Thanks.

I'm trying to get a rough estimate of the

1. population of India in the Maurya, Gupta and Pala periods; and
2. the number of Buddhist monks and nuns for those same time periods.

I know, this is insane. There's no census until the 19th century, limited
epigraphical info, few records, etc. Still, I wonder if you know of any
innovative research strategies that might have been ushered in by the
computer age. Satellite photographs taken with a film speed faster than
the speed of light that records the past? That kind of thing.
