Query on var.nabheda
A while back a colleague in Chinese linguistics asked me virtually the
same question.  While I don't remember the details, I did try,
unsuccessfully, to track
the text called varna-bheda-vidhi.   If I remember correctly, a single
manuscript of this
text is listed in Aufrecht's Catalogus Catalogorum, with reference to an
old, unpublished ms. catalogue of a collection in, I think, in Mysore.
There doesn't seem to be much chance of finding a copy or edition of what
seems to be an obscure and minor text.  But guessing from the title and
its resemblance to similar names of other texts, I would venture that it
is probably a late or modern about Sanskrit "spelling rules" with
reference to minor problems like varying sibilants (Z/s, etc.).  In
other words, the term
varna-bheda here probably meant 'differentiating between [similar or
frequently confused] sounds/letters', and as far as I know it does not
occur elsewhere in the grammatical tradition; certainly it is not a
standard term.  I doubt
very much that it would have had anything to do with "syllable dimidation"
or the like.
