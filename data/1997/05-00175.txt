During an idle holiday few years ago, I was fooling around with
various "indic" numbers, calculations etc.  They *seemed* to be 
based on trinary logic.
A rudimentary example is how easy it is to factor numbers - 108
is (3**3) x (2**3) --  of course, if you like symmetry and sequences
you can also multiply that by (1**3)!  That would make 3 factors, 
3 numbers in a sequence and 3 cubes.  The other number mentioned 
1,728,000 can be trivially split as (2**3) x (3**3) x (2**3) x (10**3).  
[ By the way, "a**b" means "a" raised to the power of "b".]
Bizarre?  Certainly.  But most numbers that I looked at had the 
"thread of 3", interwoven in it.
