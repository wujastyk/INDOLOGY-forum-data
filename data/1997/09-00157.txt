Q: mArjArahatyA
Sounds like we're coming full circle to last summer's thread about Durga's
lion, which I (still) can trace back to analogues in Kusana coinage and
Ishtar, and Sekhmet, the lion-headed goddess of ancient Egypt, while we're
at it!
Seriously,
Michael Rabe
P.S. Three cheers for the haasya-rasam from S Krishna, Sudalaimuthu
Palaniappan and N. Ganesan
