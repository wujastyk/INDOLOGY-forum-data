I can't say for sure what it IS, but it is not from Macbeth. The word
(shirk) comes into use well after Shakespeare. Perhaps it is a reference to
what macbeth MIGHT have said when he prepared to kill Duncan.

>Although cricket has been a game since Henry VIII (also called
"stool-ball"), the cricket (insect) is an evil omen in Macbeth. Malvolio is
of course, a character in Twelfth Night. There is, in Much Ado, a reference
to "tennis balls," but I can't remember precisely where.

I think what you have here is pseudo-quotation; that is, characters making
up phrases which they imply are quotes from literature. What you might call
"affected scholarship" or perhaps private jokes alluding to school
experiences. So the people are using Shakespearian names and dialect, but
not actually quoting.
