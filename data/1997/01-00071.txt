Q: Sanskrit-English dictionary
Regarding a Sanskrit-English Dictionary which uses transliteration as well as devanaagarii, I suppose the obvious choice is M. Monier-Williams' _A Sanskrit-English Dictionary_, Revised Edition, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1899. 
Reprints are available from Oxford University Press (?75-80) Munshiram Manoharlal in Delhi (probably ?20-30) and for a compact version (in size not contents), Tokyo, Meicho Fukyukai, 1986 (JapYen 15,000 when I bought it, but probably more now).
Hope this helps.
