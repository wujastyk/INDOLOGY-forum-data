Anshuman Pandey and Dominik Wujastyk have both suggested using (La)TeX,
and I would agree that this is probably the best route to take. For my
money, Velthuis's Devnag package (which is also the basis of the Itrans
system, or was last time I looked) still gives the best output. But it
would be necessary to know more about the form of the text that you have.
If it is a Romanised representation of some sort, it should be easy to
convert, and I might well be able to help. (But with any luck I'll be
leaving for India for a month fairly soon.)
