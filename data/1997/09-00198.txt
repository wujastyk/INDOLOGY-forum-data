Too many synonyms?

Sorry by mistake I have sent an incomplete posting. I beg your indulgence.
First of all let me correct the transliteration of the example I have
given. It is  `divu krIDA vijigIshA vyavahAra dyuti stuti mOda mada swapna
kAnti gatishu'.
This is the first dhatu in DivAdi GaNa. The single root `divu' is supposed
to represent 10 dufferent actions that are listed above. krIDa = to play,
vijigIshA = to aspire to conquer, vyavahara = to conduct, dyuti = to shine,
stuti = to praise, mOda = to rejoice, mada = to be drunk, swapna = to
dream, kAnti = to glow, gati = to move.
For one action we find many verbs like
bhU, asa = to be
gam, s.r, char etc. = to move
In nouns there are many names for the same object (paryAya padAs) and many
meanings to a single noun (nAnArthas).
One of the theories about their existence is that aryans acquired these as
they wandered through different lands with defferent dilects and laguages.
I would like to know the present thinking.
