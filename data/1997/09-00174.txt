Dear John,
I am not sure, but reading your message I thought of a voluminous work of the
German scholar Heinrich L|ders and a title like VaruNa
Heiner
Dear List Members,
   Does anyone recall a book about Rta? I seem to remember Motilal had one but
I can't seem to locate such.
   Thanks in advance.
