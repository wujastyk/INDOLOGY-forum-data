Atharva Veda info request
Hello Jan,
There is one translation of the AV which comes to mind and that is the
one by Whitney. Here is an abbreviated record:
_Atharva-veda Samhita_
(Translated with a critical and exegetical commentary_
by William Dwight Whitney
Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1962.
Hope this helps.
Regards,
Anshuman Pandey
