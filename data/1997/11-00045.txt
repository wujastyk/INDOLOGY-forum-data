m/anusvAra & s/visarga
I wrote yesterday:
Well maybe I _shouldn't_ have been so sure! The problem was
to make certain that I couldn't find the following sequences
in any Sanskrit word:
                     mk, mkh, mg, mgh, mG
                     mc, mch, mj, mjh, mJ
                     mT, mTh, mD, mDh, mN
                     mt, mth, md, mdh, mn
                     my, mr,  ml, mv
                     mz, mS,  ms,
                     mh.
Today, with my eyesight somewhat improved, I checked a list
of conjuncts, and sure enough I find, <gasp>, conjuncts for
sequences mna, mya, mra, mla, mva!
So now I'd like to ask, _are_ there any Sanskrit words where
             mna,     mya, mra, mla, mva
are pronounced with a full, real m, and are opposed to other
words with sequences
             Mna/nna, Mra, Mya, Mla, Mva
or are those conjuncts only used for orthographic variants?
In other words,
when one sees                mna,     mya, mra, mla, mva
may one always spell it      Mna/nna, Mya, Mra, Mla, Mva
or not? (And if not, are forms with mn, my, ... nevertheless
fairly rare?)
(Well, I'm not optimistic, but you see it's not easy to give
up such a convenient idea :)
