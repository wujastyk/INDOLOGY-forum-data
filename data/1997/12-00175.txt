Mellon Foreign Area Fellowship Competition-U.S. Library of Congress
***************************************************************************
LIBRARY OF CONGRESS - MELLON FOREIGN AREA FELLOWSHIP COMPETITION
The Library of Congress is again accepting applications for its Mellon
Foreign Area Fellowship Research Awards.  The post-doctoral fellowships,
made possible by a grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, were
designed to support research that uses the Library's unrivalled
foreign-language and area-studies collections.  The Mellon Foundation
grant finances three years of fellowship competitions.  This will be the
second year that the fellowships are offered.  The deadline for
submission of applications is January 15, 1998.
In addition to the requirements of U.S. citizenship or permanent
residency and possession of a doctoral degree, the awards are for
scholars who are proposing or working on a second major research project
with a focus on foreign-language materials.  Fellowships may last from
five to 11 months and can begin no sooner than August 1, 1998.  Stipends
of $3,000 per month, up to a maximum of $33,000 for 11 months, will be
awarded; they may be used to extend the research period supported by
other funds.
The Mellon Fellowships are administered by the Office of Scholarly
Programs.  They were first announced in January 1997 and five awards
resulted from the first competition.  In addition to work on their
projects, fellows will be presenting their research and sharing their
insights and experiences during occasional gatherings.  Application
forms and further information may be obtained from the Office of
Scholarly Programs, Library of Congress, Washington, DC  20540-4860;
telephone (202) 707-3302; fax (202) 707-3595; email scholarly at loc.gov.
Applications may be submitted by mail, fax, or e-mail.  Additional
information, including an application, is also available at the Library
of Congress home page at http://lcweb.loc.gov.
