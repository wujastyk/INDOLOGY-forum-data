avidya in Pali literature
The Pali equivalent of Sanskrit viparyaasa is vipallaasa, but the forms 
vipariyesa and vipallattha are also found. The four vipallaasa are 
found in the later Nikaaya texts (e.g. A II 52) and early Abhidhamma 
texts (e.g. Vibh 376). For further references, see the PTS Pali-English 
Dictionary.
