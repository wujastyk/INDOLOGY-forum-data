CFP "Hindu" as the "other" of "South Asian Islam"
				     Announcement and Call for Papers
The _International Journal of Hindu Studies_ is planning a special issue
for December 1998 on 
	How Islam in its relation to South Asia has represented,
	over time, its distinct other, the 'Hindu' and, in turn,
 	how these representations have shaped the sense of both
	Hindu and Islamic identity and interaction.
Contributions submitted for this special issue will be evaluated through
the usual _International Journal of Hindu Studies_ peer reviews. 
Manuscripts, including notes, should not exceed 40 pages in length. Please
submit four copies. All submitted work should be double-spaced, including
extracts, notes, and references. Footnotes should be as few as possible,
and typed double-spaced at the end of the text.  Documentation should
follow the style recommended in sections 16.3 through 16.28 of the
_Chicago Manual of Style_, 14 ed. Authors are encouraged to submit tables,
figures, maps, photographs, and other illustrations along with their
manuscripts; please consult the editor for specifications.  Additional
guidelines on manuscript preparation will be sent upon request.
The deadline for submission is November 15, 1997. Completed manuscripts,
inquiries about material for possible publication, and correspondence to
the editor should be send to the Journal's editorial offices:
