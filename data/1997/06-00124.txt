I can't resist the temptation to mention Ray Bradbury' short story
"Fahrenheit 479" here. (It was filmed). It is about a society where
literature is forbidden and books burned (they burn at the temperature
stated above), and where rebellious people learn books by heart and thus
"become" the Republic by Plato, Shakespear's dramas etc. and recite
themselves to each other. 

I wonder if he got the idea from ancient literature.
