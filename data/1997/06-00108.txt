Q. the position of "sarva"
Dear Members
I am studying Indian logic, especially inferential formulae.
Troughout my study, a question has arised. It is about the sentences
with "sarva."
That is, whether the next two sentences have the same meaning.
1) "sarva-nominative" A-nominative B-nominative
2) A-nominative "sarva-nominative" B-nominative
In each case, "sarva", A and B have the same grammatical gender, number and
case.
1) can be translated as "All A is B, but can 2) also translated as 1)?
It is important question for me, because both 1) and 2)  are used as a
conditional statement.
If 2) must be translated as "All B is A," the logical relation will also be
conversed.
question.
