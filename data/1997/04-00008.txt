ye me bhakta-janah partha ...
Dear Prof. Wall,
This verse is found in Bhaktirasamritasindhu (1.2.218), as are so many other
quotations found in Caitanyacaritamrita. 
Unfortunately, Rupa Gosvami has only specified Adipurana as the source of
the verse, and I cannot say more than that, never having seen the Adipurana.
