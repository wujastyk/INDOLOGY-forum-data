Q: Black Draupadi?
According to tradition, both RAmAyaNa and MahAbhArata are called "itihAsAs";
and 'the popular memory' or 'smr^ti' would refer to the purANAs. This would
imply that MBh would be more historical and the purANAs would be more
mythological.i.e., if tradition has any significance for Indologists
