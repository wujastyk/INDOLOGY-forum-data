LC has a short run of a serial with a title something like "J. of the
Oriental Nobility Institute, Woking."  I seem to recall it was mostly in
Sanskrit. It seems to be in process of cataloging.  I will try to track
down where it is.  I know nothing about the institute or Leitner and was
always puzzled by the corporate name.  I wondered if it was some sort of a
public school (in the British sense) for the Indian aristocracy.
