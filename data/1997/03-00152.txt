I apologize to all Dutch speakers for butchering the grammar
of the beautiful Dutch tongue (inadvertently)

Of course the "names" of the adjectives should be their stem.
Thus: "indogermaans" or "indoeuropees".

But you would say "indogermaanse talen" or "indoeuropese talen".

The only language that one is entitled to butcher on the net
is of course English. That's the downside of being
an international language :)
