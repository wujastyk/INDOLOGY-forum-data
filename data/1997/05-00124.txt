Oriya Fonts
Hi,
You may like to checkout and use the fonts usable directly in MS Word, in the CD-ROM containing 1500+ fonts for all South asian language scripts, including Oriya, brought out by the NewYork publisher, Scanrom. email: 73760.1005 at compuserve.com I think Oriya has three typefaces in this corpus.
Best wishes. k.
