indology mss.
Internet is a more user-friendly (and less expensive!) medium than
microfilm...
I was happy to see the beautiful palm leaf samples on the internet at:

The University of Pennsylvania holds the largest number of South Asian
manuscripts in the Norh America. Here are some examples of them. There
will be more to come.

I request the UPenn to put up more samples soon. This may hopefully induce
other institutions worldwide to do the same.

replied:
The entire Penn. collection of Sanskrit manuscripts was published years
ago on microfiche, and has thus been publicly available on very easy
terms for a long, long time.  This is quite apart from the fact that
anyonewriting to Penn could get an individual microfilm without difficulty.
All the best,
