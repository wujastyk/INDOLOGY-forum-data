Internet is a more user-friendly (and less expensive!) medium than
microfilm...

I was happy to see the beautiful palm leaf samples on the internet at:

http://www.library.upenn.edu/etext/sasia/skt-mss/index.html

The University of Pennsylvania holds the largest number of South Asian
manuscripts in the Norh America. Here are some examples of them. There
will be more to come.

                    K.sauravidhi
                    Raatriisuukta (from RV)
                    Vaajinabhak.savicaara
                    Tithinir.naya
                    'Siitalaastotra from Skandapurana
                    Amba.daparivraajakakathana
                    Nyaayamakaranda
                    Prayaagasnaanavidhi

I request the UPenn to put up more samples soon. This may hopefully induce
other institutions worldwide to do the same.

The entire Penn. collection of Sanskrit manuscripts was published years
ago on microfiche, and has thus been publicly available on very easy
terms for a long, long time.  This is quite apart from the fact that
anyonewriting to Penn could get an individual microfilm without difficulty.

All the best,
