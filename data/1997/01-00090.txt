Devanagari for the Mac
There are several devanagari fonts for the Mac, some commercial or
semi-commercial. I use one called U.B.C. Nagari designed by Prof. Aklujkar
at U.B.C. and distributed at Religious Studies at McGill. But the best font
is the new Wikner font for LaTeX which I use. Its advantage over the
original Velthuis font as far as I am concerned is the fact that with one
stroke you can translate all the devanagari into Roman transliteration and
vica versa. Really neat. If you wish more info and you are in Montreal
(which I suspect), give me a call at 844-6267 and I can give you more
details. There are now preprocessors for both Velthuis and Wikner available
for the Mac.
Best wishes

P.S. I can understand your frustration with LaTeX but once you have
mastered it it performs like a dream.
