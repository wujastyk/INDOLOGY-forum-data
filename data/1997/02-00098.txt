beef eating in RV 8.43.11
Hello Beatrice,
I didn't think that "beef-eater" would be controversial.
ukSA'nna = "whose food consists of bulls"
vaZA'nna = "whose food consists of [non-pregnant] cows"
Both are hapax legomena, and both modify agna'ye.
Agni is in general a great eater of sacrificial victims [paZu'] of all sorts.
Do you interpret these differently?
best wishes,
George
