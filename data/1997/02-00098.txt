Hello Beatrice,

I didn't think that "beef-eater" would be controversial.

ukSA'nna = "whose food consists of bulls"

vaZA'nna = "whose food consists of [non-pregnant] cows"

Both are hapax legomena, and both modify agna'ye.
Agni is in general a great eater of sacrificial victims [paZu'] of all sorts.

Do you interpret these differently?

best wishes,
George
