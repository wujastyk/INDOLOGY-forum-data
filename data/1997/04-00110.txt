Nietzschegati
  The source is most likely P. Deussen, an acquiantance of Nietzche's (he
was also friends w/ Schopenhauer, who was well-read in matters
Indological).  See Halbfass' _India and Europe_ (1988) and Raymond
Schwab's _The Oriental Renaissance_ (1984 [1950]). (There's also a book by
Mistry, _Nietzsche and Buddhism:  Prolegomenon to a Comparative Study_
(1981) which is probably the most comprehensive source.)
