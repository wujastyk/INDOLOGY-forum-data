Ju.t.tu - long, doubled '.t', otherwise it's perfectly standard Kannada.

information, without textual corroboration), there are different styles
according to the Vedic tradition to which the wearer belongs: thus
Atharvavedins were not supposed to have a ju.t.tu at all, but to shave their
heads completely, and the style of the ju.t.tu in the case of the others was
determined by the "saakhaa to which they belonged. (I believe that .Rgvedins
were supposed to wear a broader one than Yajurvedins, but I am not completely
sure.)
But also, the ju.t.tu was largely a matter of fashion. Still about a hundred
years ago in southern coastal Karnataka, any man could walk around with a
ju.t.tu: brahmin, sudra, Hindu, Jaina, everyone. And still today in Bangalore,
ju.t.tu-s are seen.
