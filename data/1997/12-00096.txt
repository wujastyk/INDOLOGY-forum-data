Graha epithets (tArA,tArakA and tAraka)
  Yaroslav Vassilkov wrote, quoting me first:
Yes, you are right; the Karnaparvan-passages decide the case. And my
explanation was, after all, a little far-fetched. I should have consulted
Soerensen's Mahabharata Index, p. 675, s.v. T?rak?maya: "causing evil to
T?raka?".
