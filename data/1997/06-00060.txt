	Dear Birgit,

	I'm not a Vedicist but I know that epics and prayers are two
literary genres who differ totally in pragmatic: nor same circumstances,
nor same 'talker', nor same 'addressed' (men/Gods), nor same intention
(compare Pater Noster or Ave Maria with Holy Bible). So you can't apply
Parry's work to the Vedas and Renou was quite right.
	Regards,
Dominique
