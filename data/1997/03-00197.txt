Q: IGNCA - Gitagovinda
I saw the IGNCA's Gitagovinda project a few years ago in Delhi.  It was a
multimedia computer presentation of some nice illustrated manuscripts of
the text, along with choices permitting the text to be heard/sung.  When I
saw it it was already a nice presentation, though nascent.  I shall be in
Delhi next month at IGNCA, and can say more when I get back in May.  
All the best,
Dominik
