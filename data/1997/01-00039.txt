Introduction to Dravidian Lingustics
Dear Indologists,
can anybody recommend me some good English-language general introduction to
Dravidian Linguistics? I would also be happy to know which are the most
controversial questions within the field; is e.g. the link with Elamite
generally accepted. Note that I know virtually nothing about the subject,
nor do I know any of the languages concerned.
Thanks

"Peace is not simply the absence of war.
It is not a passive state of being.
We must wage peace, as vigilantly as we wage war."
