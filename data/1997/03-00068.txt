Hello to everybody

it seems that in the javanese Mahabharata, there is a story about Bhima 
searching for his own self; during the search, he goes to the ground of 
the ocean, where he finds himself - only in a reduced (smaller) form of his 
"normal" self.

Does anybody know, whether this story also occurs in the Sanskrit (or any 
other Indian) Mahabharata - and if so -- where?

Thanks.  ULRIKE
