tArakAmaya again

Since both tArakA and tArA as appellativum mean 'star', I think their
separation is a bit artificial. As you know, in sanskrit proper names are
easily substituted by their synonyms.
I agree that some purANa authors might have understood the term this way.
But is it not more probable that the expression originally was coined
because the main person in one story was called TAraka and in the other
TArA (to which TArakA could be taken as a synonym)? In this case, the term
can only be interpreted as tAraka+Amaya if referring to the TAraka-Skanda
story, because otherwise the long -a- in the third syllable would not be
accounted for. But, if you prefer, you can, of course, also in this case
stick to tArakA-maya, `full of stars': I am convinced that this story, too,
is an ancient star myth. What I primarily wanted to exclude was the
assumption that the term originated from a combination of tArA and kAma
which seems impossible to me. The one varia lectio in Mbh. (tArakAmayoH) I
would consider as the fanciful idea of a late scribe.
The first part of the compound could be understood with instrumental
function: 'disastrous through/because of the stars, or, rather: because of
TArakA=TArA=(the goddess) Star'. In the case of the TAraka-Skanda story,
the meaning could, of course, be 'resulting in the destruction of TAraka',
and I am still inclined to believe that this was the origin of the term and
that the development went as outlined by Ya. Vassilkov.
