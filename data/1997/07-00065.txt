Sorting Brahmi
Dominik commented that the best way to sort Brahmi text might be to use
Perl, which (he said) allows you to specify a sort order. Unfortunately
that's not true, even in Perl 5; the language allows you to specify a sort
*routine* of your own devising, but that's not really much help for this
requirement. It could certainly be done in Perl, but, unusually, there
would be no great advantage to using Perl as against any other language.
