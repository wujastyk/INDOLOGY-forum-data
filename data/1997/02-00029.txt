Q: _catur-daMsshTra_ and _sahisshNu_
	Ganguli's translation of caturda.m.s.tra seems to follow the
explanation given in Shamkara's comentary on this text.  This is
Shamkara's first alternative.  Shamkara offers his second alternative that
the word da.m.s.traa perhaps refers to "s.rnga and then offers the passage
"catvaari "s.rngaa trayo asya paadaa" etc. in support.  On the whole
though there does not seem to be any high conviction in Shamkara's
alternatives.
