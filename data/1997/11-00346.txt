The INSTITUTE OF ASIAN STUDIES (Madras) and the First International
Conference Seminar on Skanda-Murukan have had a slightly different URL Web
address assigned to them. You can now find them listed together in the
'heritage' directory of xlweb.com at this URL:

http://xlweb.com/heritage/index.htm Cultural Heritage menu of xlweb.com

This menu page directs browsers to:

http://xlweb.com/heritage/asian/index.htm home page of the IAS Madras;
http://xlweb.com/heritage/murukan/index.htm Skanda-Murukan conf home page;
http://xlweb.com/heritage/skanda/index.htm the Murugan bhakti home page.

      * * * the all-new Institute of Asian Studies web site * * *
      * * * and the Murugan Bhakti site of related articles * * *

The Murukan Conference home page is expanding fast -- visit it regularly
for frequent updates and detailed postings (with color graphics) including:

     * latest information updates about Murugan Conference preparations;

     * Aru Padai Veedu post-conference tour of major Murukan temples;

     * scholar participation in workshop & Tamil Nadu tour planning;

     * participating scholars: topics, synopses and contact addresses;

     * hyper-links to related WWW & ftp sites;

     * video documentary projects in progress;

     * Kaumara studies news & views


* * * CALL FOR PAPERS * * *

Participating scholars should submit their topics  & synopses soon so that
we may keep participants informed of one another's work. This will
facilitate exchanges between scholars studying related topics.

There is still time for interested scholars to propose topics for the
Conference. But kindly contact us soon.

If you have not already sent a synopsis (approx 200+ words) of your work in
progress, kindly do so *soon* and we will post it promptly on the
Conference web site. Kindly include some bio-data including publications to
date and other works in progress.

If you know other scholars who would be interested to visit the home page
or perhaps to participate in the Dec '98 conference, forward this
information to them.

Your suggestions are needed to help us to improve the Web site and
organization of the Conference. If you inform me of the URL of relevant
documents on the Internet, I can connect them to the Conference home page
with hyper-links, for instance.

Note: if for some reason the URL given above does not work, search for
keyword "murukan" or "skanda" and you will find it.
