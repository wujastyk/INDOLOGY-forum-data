Dear Colleagues,

It is a pleasure to announce that:

The *Nina* font for Devanagari of the *International Journal of Tantric Studies* 
has been released for the Windows and Unix platforms, in both True Type and Type 1 
formats. 
The Macintosh version will be available next week, in both True Type and Type 1 
formats. 
In the next few weeks, we will also release a set of macros to convert to and from 
the CS and CSX encoding schemes.

The *Nina* font is based on a totally new encoding which allows the concurrent 
use of extended characters for the European languages, and characters for Devanagari. 
This makes possible for scholars to use just one font for all their publications.

You can download the zip file containing the True Type and Type 1 versions of the font 
from the following location:

The *Nina* font has been designed by Dr. Arch. Ludovico Magnocavallo, our Technical 
Editor.

Enjoy and send your comments,

Enrica Garzilli
