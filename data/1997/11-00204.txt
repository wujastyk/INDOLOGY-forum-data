Subject: "Combination" in Indian Mathematics

Dear Members
I have surprised that Indian philosopher exactly calculated the number of
combination
when I am reading philosophical texts, which, in my case, is Nyaayavaartika.
In it  he calculated exactly the number of cases where we select
one, two, three and four from five members. Of course, if I do anyway, I
will list up
all cases, and count such cases. I don't think such a listing and counting
is so difficult,
so he is thinkable to adopt such a method. But if someone know the
mathematical? tradition of
calculation of "combination" in India, please teach me.
