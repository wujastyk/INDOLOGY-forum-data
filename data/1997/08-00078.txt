Helene Meyer-Frank had some relation (wife?) to Heinrich Meyer-Benfey 
(d. 1945) who wrote a book about Tagore in 1922. Earlier the two had 
translated together: Tagore, Das Opfer und andere Dramen. 1920.
The others are unknown to me
P.S. I have still to check details of their publications from library 
catalogues etc. but at present there is no time for it.
I hope this helps
