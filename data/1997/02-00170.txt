German Indology
	We think matters should be said straight at the very 
	outset in order to avoid any misunderstanding. Readers 
	should be made clear about the purpose for "German Indology", 
	a "list of institutions and persons concerned with 
	Sanskrit and allied studies" compiled by Prof. Dieter 
	Schlingloff in 1996. For those of us in Germany the 
	(unwritten) reasons are very clear.
Thanks for the detailed explanation... the misunderstanding
seems to have been entirely Dominik's... as evidenced by his
ad hominem remarks.
The misunderstanding of Peter Fluegel on the other hand seems 
to have been just due to a "typo" in his reading...  he misread 
it as "German ideology" instead of "German indology".
-Srini.
ps: I remember similar off-the-cuff remarks made against postings
of Dr.S.Kalyanaraman to the list a while ago.
