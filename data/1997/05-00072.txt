If the newspapers are insufficient evidence, I may refer to my recently
published study of Kannada fiction, particularly the two chapters on themes
about women and about caste. I have given a summary of a popular novel in which
part of the heroine's problem is that her elder sister is dark, hence
unmarriable, while the heroine is fair and hence beautiful and desirable. In
another novel, the fair (i.e. beautiful) widowed heroine is driven to
prostitution and curses her skin colour, for she thinks men would have left her
alone if she had been dark. These are only two examples among many.
