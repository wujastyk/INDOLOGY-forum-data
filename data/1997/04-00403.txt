more Gita recordings (sigh)
If anyone is maintaining a canonical list of Gita recordings
I can mention but I don't particularly recommend, something
I've just heard, a musical rendition of Chapters 12 & 15 by
Yesudas, music by Rangasami Parthasarathy (who apparently
also set Chapter 2 elsewhere) (Oriental Records CD 114)
Couldn't those guys find anything other than the Gita to in-
flict their bad taste on?
