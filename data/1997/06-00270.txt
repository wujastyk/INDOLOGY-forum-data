epics and oral traditions
Another modern day example of the below is the Baul 
singers of Bengal. Their songs, particularly the class 
of Baul songs called /deho tatto/ (philosophical songs 
about the body), contain a large enough percentage of 
archaic vocabulary that even educated Bengalis cannot 
understand the songs very well. Authentic Baul 
singers, who are largely illiterate (or at least 
living as part of an illiterate culture, meaning that 
although they are able to read, they don't, except 
when necessary) still compose songs using this archaic 
vocabulary. The fact that well-read Bengalis do not 
understand the songs suggests that it not simply a
literary form of Bengali used in the songs but rather 
a vocabulary that is genuinely archaic (I can't read 
Bengali myself so haven't been able to confirm this 
first-hand)--if others on this list can confirm this, 
I'd be interested.
