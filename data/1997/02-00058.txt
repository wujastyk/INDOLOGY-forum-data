For some years, Richard Gombrich has been plugging away at the idea that
the earliest Buddhist canon, and perhaps even the Buddha himself, used
humour as an important device in ridiculing and superceding orthodox
brahmanical religion.  See especially his recent _How Buddhism Began_
(London, Athlone, 1996). 

Best wishes, 
Dominik
