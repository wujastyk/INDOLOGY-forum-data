CFP: 'Psychologizing Hindus'
                                2nd Announcement and Call for Papers
A special issue of _International Journal of Hindu Studies_, planned for
December 1999, entitled 'Psychologizing Hindus' will review, explore, and
reinterpret the ways 'Western' psychology has interpreted Hindus and
Hinduism and make new proposals.
Possible topics might include the uses that Western psychological theory
(primarily personality and psychodynamic theory)  has been used
(unmodified or adapted) for various purposes in South Asia (psychotherapy
is one interesting issue here), and the ways that that theory has affected
self-images and the adaptations to modernization of some classes of South
Asian individuals, and how that theory relates to wider Western attitudes
and ideologies concerning South Asia.
Contributions submitted for this special issue will be evaluated through
the usual _International Journal of Hindu Studies_ peer reviews.
Manuscripts, including notes, should not exceed 40 pages in length. Please
submit three copies. All submitted work should be double-spaced, including
extracts, notes, and references. Footnotes should be as few as possible,
and typed double-spaced at the end of the text.  Documentation should
follow the style recommended in sections 16.3 through 16.28 of the
_Chicago Manual of Style_, 14 ed. Authors are encouraged to submit tables,
figures, maps, photographs, and other illustrations along with their
manuscripts; please consult the editor for specifications.  Additional
guidelines on manuscript preparation will be sent upon request.
The deadline for submission is August 1998. Completed manuscripts,
