nak.satras
Can any of the astronomers out there kindly tell me:
1) Which nak.satra the vernal equinox presently occurs in?
2) Which nak'satra the pit.rpak.sa in the waning half of Bhaadrapadaa
occurs in (and how many weeks after the summer solstice does this take
place)?
Thanks,   Edwin Bryant    Columbia U.
