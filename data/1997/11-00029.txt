Thanks to Elliot Stern for destroying my illusions :) You say:

>Sorry, you will have to continue typing those H's.

Damn! The real pain is to have to reach for that shift key.
I think I'll just use <x> for visarga then. How does this
look: duxkha, azvax?

(I'd just use <:> (du:kha, azva:) but that would require
shift too)
