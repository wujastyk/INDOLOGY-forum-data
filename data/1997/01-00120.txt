	R. Soneji gave a list of books on Durga Saptashati (=Devi Mahatmyam). 
	Here is one more, plus a question:

	Devi Mahatmyam Translated & with a commentary by Swami Siddhinathananda. 
	Bharatiya Vidya bhavan, Kulapati Munshi Marg, Bombay.

	This book was reviewed in Vedanta Kesari (Oct. 1996) by P.S. Ramamurti. 

	Question:
	In the above review Ramamurti says: "There are seven existing commentaries 
	on Devi Mahatmyam." Does anyone know more about these commentaries?

	Thanks and Om,
	Swami Vishvarupananda
