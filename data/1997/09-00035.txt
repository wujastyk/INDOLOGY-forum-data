Dravidian Cryptography:Aasanga

	Till now, I refrain to comment the 'Dravidian cryptography',
because I don't know any word of Dravidian. But this mail is very
astounding!
	1) We know very few about Aasanga who appears just in few slokas of
RV VIII, 1. The Hymn and the comment of Sayana give just the impression he
was impotent and that prayers of his wife restore his virility. But the
story is actually unknown and the romance of Mr Kumar is purely
speculative, just sustained by an isolated passage of the Zaankhaayana
Zrauta Suutra (XVI.11.17) where zaazvatii is taken for a woman's name.
Aasanga is not the better example of a woman!
	2) Aasanga and hengasu are very hard to connect, even with a
permutation: what about the 'h' and the vowels ?
	3) The joke of connecting words with few common phonems is too easy
to be a proof. Choose any languages at random, statistics will show you
thousand examples of such links. Just two: the Greek 'gunaa' (related to
vedic 'gnaa') is 'woman', the popular French 'gonzesse' is 'woman': much
better concordance with hengasu than Aasanga!
	I don't intend to begin a debate (I'm not a specialist of
Dravidian), that was just my opinion.

PS 1: Renfrew's theories are perhaps true, perhaps not. Mallory has other
theories.
PS 2: Not buried, a skelet can't be conserved for a long time. No skelets
were found in destroyed Minoan and Mycenian palaces.
