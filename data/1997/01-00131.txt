Summer Skt at Harvard
                 SUMMER SANSKRIT at HARVARD.
Like last year, I got several inquiries regarding our offering of
Introductory Sanskrit this summer, -- taught here since 1988. 
The offical new dates & fees are not yet finalized;
I add **last year's** data as a guideline.

  (8 units)  Monday-Thursday 3:30 - 6 p.m.
  June 24 - August 16;  exam period Aug. 13-16

  This course, equivalent to two semesters of course work, will

  essential vocabulary. Emphasis will also be given to correct 
  translation of passages from simple narrative literature to the epics.
