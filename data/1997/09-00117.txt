Claims have been in India that Mayas are related to Mayasura, the Great
Architect of Asuras, the Father-in-law of Ravana, and the builder of the
Mayasabha (a court cum palace)  for Dharmaraja in Mahabharata. This was one
of the things that ultimately led to the Mahabharata war becuase Duryodhana
was jealous of the sabha.
