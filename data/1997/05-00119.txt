There is "dies ater" 'a dark day', though I can't remember any idiom where
"niger" is 'evil', except "nigromantia" 'black magic', which is a
misrendering of Greek "nekromanteia" 'magic performed on a funeral site,
raising the dead (as a means of getting an oracle)'. Interestingly Latin
has two words corresponding to 'black': "niger" glossed (by Cassell's) as
'shining black' and "ater" glossed as 'dull black'. I read somewhere the
remark that the skin color of an "Aethiops" should be called "Niger", while
the color of a hanged (presumably white-skinned in life!) person was
"ater". I don't know if there is ancient authority for the latter. "Niger"
was also used for black hair, and is hence found as the cognomen of at
least one Roman family. It is an interesting fact that color words were not
used as racial tags in Classical Latin. The word for 'black' person is
invariably the Greek loan-word "Aethiops", or "Numidius". The word "Afer"
"Africa" and "Africanus" referred to people and things pertaining to the
Semitic Carthaginians -- and presumably was originally a self-description.
There is no term for 'white person' -- probably because Greeks and romans
didn't come into anything like regular contact with non-whites until
comparatively late.

How appropriate a word in the context: "denigrated"!
