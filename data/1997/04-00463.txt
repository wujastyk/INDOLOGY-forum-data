                         nAmA
                         ****

I have seen several nAmAvaLis printed by Saiva Adheenams
for the utsava mUrtis of temples under their management
in Thanjavur delta. TiruvAvaDutuRai, Dharmapuram, TiruppanandAL
adheenams have many famous ancient temples under their administration.

Chidambaram Nataraja has his own sahasranamams. There is
a Mucukunda Sahasranamam on Tiruvarur Tyagaraja.
It is worth looking at the recent, (fabulous, acc. to
Indira Peterson) book, "Tyagaraja cult in Tiruvarur"
by Rajesvari Ghose.

While talking to Rajarathna Bhattar of Meenakshi Temple, Houston,
he told that there is only one Siva namavali, but many for
goddesses depending on the kshetram. Is this true that
there is only one siva sahasranAmam?

There are tamil nAmAvaLis extracted out of Tevaram,
for Murukan from Tiruppukazh, etc.,


I believe that all the nAmAs for gurus are fairly recent.
