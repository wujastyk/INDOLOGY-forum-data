        I believed abhiSEka, beeing from sic-, just a light aspersion of
few drops to consecrate (especially a king). A bath seems slightly
different and, if you can give me a good reference, I would like to know
special circumstances of such a ceremony (procession ? place of the bath ?
danger to see the Goddess in His nudity ?).
        Interresting for me is too the name choosen to honour the Goddess
because I don't understand well the part 'tripura' in this context. There
is an itihasa to explain it ?
        Merci d'avance,
