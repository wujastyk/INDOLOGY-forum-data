More information on the cat issue:

I am a Hindu, and throughout my childhood I was told that if one killed a cat, one would have to go to the holy site of Kashi (Benares), where one could repent for the sin by bathing in the Ganges. It is to be noted that a similar form of atonement exists for the killing of a Brahmin.

David!
 Could you please ask this gentleman as to whether this is some kind of 
a family belief or is it some belief in the area where he come from? I 
know there are families where it is wrong to kill snakes, the story is 
that the snake curses the family causing its children to have
a funny skin coloration- I remember reading about a family in 
Maharashtra which had this tale to tell....I don't think there is 
anything generic religious belief about this.....

Looking forward to your reply,

Krishna
