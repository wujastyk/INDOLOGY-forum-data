sanketi tamil
I'm looking for bibliographical references on Sanketi Tamil, a dialect
spoken in parts of Karnataka. I've uncovered one or two essays (by H. S.
Ananthanarayana) dealing with sound changes, but is there anything of
greater scope (a grammar, for instance)? Any assistance would be
appreciated.
Thanks,
