Rudra as animal killer
Dear members of the net,
in Mbh. 7.18.35, we get the following verse:
tad babhau raudra b-ibhatsa.m b-ibhatsor y-anam -ahave /
-akr-i.da iva rudrasya ghnata.h k-al-atyaye pa/s-un //
Does anyone know about any other places where Rudra kills animals
"k-al-atyaye"? I would also be interested in literature discussing Rudra's
role as an animal killer.
Thank you for any help!
Best regards,
