Subject: Shri Satyanarayana Puja.
Message-ID: <161227031621.23782.3410662674713653461.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

This puja is performed on a regular basis at the Sri Venkateswara Temple in
Pittsburgh PA, USA. They hand out texts in several languages, depending on
who is performing it. The web address is www.svtemple.org and email is
srivaru at svtemple.org. I think they can send you what you want. Phone:
412-373-3380, address: PO Box 17280, Pittsburgh, PA 15235. They have lots
of books, audio tapes, and video tapes for sale.
