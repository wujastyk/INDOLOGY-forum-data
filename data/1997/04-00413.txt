Are the skt*.mf and skt*.tfm files placed in the appropriate directories?
They should be in the directories where other *.mf and *.tfm files are
kept. Dvips looks in these directories for these files and if they are not
there, then it returns an error. Lastly, if you placed them elsewhere, did
you remember to append that directory to your fonts path?
