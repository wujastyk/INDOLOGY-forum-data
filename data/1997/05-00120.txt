paaraajika
 Dr. Akira Hirakawa introduces the etymology of Paaraajika(Skt. Paali) in
his book.
 1) Paaraajika comes from *paaraJcika(AMg. paaraJciya)--Levi.
 2) Paaraajika comes form
paraajita--Buddhaghosa,Muulasarvaastivaadavinaya,Mvy. and PW. etc.
And Dr.Hirakawa himself says its etimology is not clear.
Does anybody know new views of its etymology?
