        I suppose Mr Sarma is 'we Hindus' and, as a great racist leader, he
give a lesson to all the poor 'western minds' and 'ordinary mortals' (I'm
one of them). I accept lessons from Indians or Westerners, but just from
gurus.
        I'm happy that most of Indian people are, just like me, ordinary
mortals and I send them my best regards,
