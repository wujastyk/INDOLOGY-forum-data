The more I think about this, the more it sounds like a fascinating piece

I would be grateful to have the reference.  Maybe other Indology people 
would be interested too, since it seems to put Truman Capote many notches
above the Vedic sages in memorization powers.  Just think of all the
metrical and other memorization helps they had, and he had... none (!) ...
And the sheer size and density of our NYC phone books... it boggles the
mind... Maybe Mr. Cowart can give us more information?
