        As Jonathan Silk and S.Krishna have understand it about Argentina
and Arjuna, 'that's true' was just a joke.
        One thing is clear: leaving numerous and structured phonetical,
morphological and semantical correspondancies, thousands of good links can
be found just by the effect of the great numbers' law, hence without any
serious proof.
        The phonetical laws fail when a word is borrowed, but borrowing of
words is rare and, usually, a word is borrowed when the thing is borrowed,
just because it was unnamed before. Hence, universal words are unlikely to
be borrowed.
