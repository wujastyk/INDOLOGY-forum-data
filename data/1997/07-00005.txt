a set of rules relating to the tri-varga. From this original set, manu,
bRhaspati and nandin, derived separate works, respectively devoted to
dharma, artha and kAma.

KS.1.2.21-24 ascribes to laukAyatikAH, (people only concerned with worldly
matters) opinions, according to which : Following the dharma is useless
because its result is future and doubtful; who, not being stupid, would
transfer something he holds in his hand into someone else's hand; a pigeon
today is better than a peacock tomorrow, just like an authentic copper coin
(kArSApaNa) is better than a doubtful gold coin (niSka)

The fact that lokAyatika is another name for the cArvAka is recorded in
Cowell's translation of the sarva-darzana-saMgraha (fourth edition,
London,1904) (see chapter 1 : "the charvaka system", it includes various
verses ascribed to bRhaspati).

See also the prabodhacandrodaya of kRSNamizra*, act II, where the
impersonification of materialism (cArvAka) says that the science of
politics is the only 'science', the triple (veda) being only a talk for
rogues (vatsa jAnAsi daNDa-nItir eva vidyA
 dhUrta-pralApas trayI),  which
shows the connection of politics and materialism, bRhaspati being the
original exponent of both. 
You'll find a very lively discussion of materialism in this play, including
verses like: "If the animal killed for a sacrifice is gaining paradise,
should not the one who orders a sacrifice have his own father executed?"
(nihatasya pazor yajJe svarga-prAptir yadIzyate / svapitA yajamAnena ki? nu
kasmAn na hanyate), etc.
