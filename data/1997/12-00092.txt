Kill before being killed
I cannot provide any information about the origin of the 'wise saying'
taR kolliyai muR kolliya, 'kill before the killing of oneself',
but, not reading Tamil, would be grateful to learn if the Tamil Jain text
NIlakEci is available in an English, French or German translation.
Thanks in advance,
Joel.
