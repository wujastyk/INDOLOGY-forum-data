Digest
Priam --
1. send a message to this address:
LISTSERV at LISTSERV.LIV.AC.UK
2. in the body of the message, put these words only:
SET INDOLOGY DIGEST
3. send it.  You'll get a confirmation from the mother computer
advising you of your settings.
Also note, you can toggle back to nodigest by doing the same thing,
sending this message:
SET INDOLOGY NODIGEST
If you do that, you'll first get a cumulative digest for all the
posts up to that point (since the prior digest -- probably sent out
every night at midnight, or something -- anyway that's fairly common
for listservs, but may vary); and then you'll again be getting the
individual messages.
Posting this, as others may wonder.
By the way, now that this is a listserv instead of a listproc, some
readers may be interested in this command (which can be sent to the
same LISTSERV@ mother computer address):
REVIEW INDOLOGY BY COUNTRY
That will generate (i.e., will have send back to you in a jiffy) a
listing of the subscribers & their addresses, itemized by country.
Quite a hefty list . . .
cheers,
d.i.
