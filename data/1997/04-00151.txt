Subject: Need Translation of Rig Veda
Message-ID: <161227029466.23782.17584651790067608545.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I need the best available translation for Rig Veda or at least for RV 10.71.
Can anybody suggest some publication or paper? (I have Ralph Griffith's
work.) Thanks in advance.

Regards
