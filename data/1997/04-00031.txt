Danielou and Tamil Musicology
	>      . . .  Since the time [Danielou] produced this book [The 
	> Ankle Bracelet in translation], there has been considerable
	> progress in Tamil musicology. However, due to the separation of
	> language studies and music/musicological studies in the present day
	> Tamilnadu, one side does not know what is happening on the other
	> side. Dr. S. Ramanathan's work in his dissertation on music of
	> cilappatikaram at Wesleyan was further advanced by Dr. V. P. K.
	> Sundaram currently at Bharatidasan University in Tiruchirappalli.
	While not acquainted with this field & its literature, must say I'm a 
	bit curious abt. the work you mention from the late singer/scholar S. 
	Ramanathan.  Do you happen to know if if Ramanathan's study (or 
	studies) found their way into print?
This is the only one in English I have seen -

	> The 82-year old Dr. Sundaram has cleared many obscurities and errors
	> with regard to ancient Tamil musicology . . . . .  and clearly
	> established the basic musical scale of ancient Tamils as 'cempAlaip
	> paN' or present rAga harikAmbodi. 
	Might you (off hand) be able to identify the Hindustani-system 
	equivalent raga (supposing that there must be one, at least in terms 
	of the scale)?  Again, this is from simple curiousity ...
