The (collected) Works of Kalidasa were published by Motilal in 1966 and
reprinted last year. Editor: C. R. Devadhar. The two volumes contain the
Sanskrit text of the plays and poems, as well as translations into English
and comments. 

They should be available on demand. I bought them a few months ago.

Best regards
