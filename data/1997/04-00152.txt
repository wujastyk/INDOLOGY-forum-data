Subject: History of Grammar and Rig Veda 10.71
Message-ID: <161227029467.23782.8728090544817593515.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Rig Veda 10.71 is about 'vAc' or speech. 10.71.2 in Griffith's translation
reads "Where, like men cleansing corn-flour in a cribble, the wise in spirit
have created language, 
Friends see and recognize the marks of friendship: their speech retains the
blessed sign imprinted."

The actual Sanskrit text reads, 

"sa'ktum iva ti'taunA puna'nto ya'tra dhi'ra manasa vAcam a'krta I
a'trA sa'hAyaH sakhiyA'ni jAnate bhadraiSaM lakSmi'r ni'hitAdhi vAc'i II" 

Here obviously signs of correct speech are intended, and may be grammar. I do
not know if there is any discussion of this in Sanskrit scholarship. Has this
hymn been ever discussed with respect to the history of the use of 'lakSaNa'
as a term synonymous with 'vyAkaraNa'? I would appreciate any
comments/references from the members.
