re. Merchandising electronic texts
Dear Indology Subscribers,
  My e-files of the MahAbhArata and the RAmAyaNa still contain 
many typing errors, as a matter of course.  It is indeed a lifelong job 
to perfect an e-file of such a huge text like the epic. I thought 
it was my obligation to continue doint it and I was just preparing 
a new version for the net in cooperation with my student M. Sugita 
when I heard about a commercial disc of them from a company 
in Munich. Now I realize that good-will is simply a source of unexpected 
troubles in this world. So I have decided to make future versions of 
my files available only in a limited circle in order not to cause further
complexity. Those who are satistied with an imperfect version of 
the e-file are free to buy that disc.
