I admire your courage Dominique. I'll risk my neck by saying that I think it
is universal knowledge. At least I believe that similar statements can be
found in a number of non-indoeuropean cultures. (If I remember correctly, I
even think I have seen some attempts from people on the socio-biology scene
to explain *why* women cannot be trusted - or why men perceive them as
untrustworthy. Or whatever).

Best regards,
