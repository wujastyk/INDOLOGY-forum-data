I admire your courage Dominique. I'll risk my neck by saying that I think it
is universal knowledge. At least I believe that similar statements can be

even think I have seen some attempts from people on the socio-biology scene
to explain *why* women cannot be trusted - or why men perceive them as
untrustworthy. Or whatever).
