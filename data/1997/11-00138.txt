savarNa
Consider the following 2 sutras from the aSTAdhyAyi (Katre's translation)
1.1.9
The (t.t.) savarNa 'homogeneous' designates phonemes which are produced by
the same articulatory effort (tulya prayatna) at the same point of
articulation in the oral cavity (Asya)
1.1.10
A vowel (aC) and a consonent (haL) [which satisfy the above condition 9] are
(nevertheless) not (na) (homogeneous 9).
In his example Katre claims that i and z (palatal s) are homogeneous. I
understand that they are both palatal, but i is a vowel (no stop) and z is a
sibilant(half contact) so it would seem that they do not have the same
articulatory effort. Without the same articulatory effort they can't be
homogeneous by 1.1.9.
Why are i and z are homogeneous? What other consonents are homogeneous with
vowels?
TIA,
