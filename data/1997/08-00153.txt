Dear Jeson:

I recall having searched in vain for a source for the example
'gandhavattvavat', which occurs first in VAcaspati's NyAyakaNikA (Pandit
edition 137.2; my dissertation, 529.4). If some other member can identify a
source, I too will be grateful.

Please also note that, when JjAnazrImitra quotes this example, it is within
a long quote from NyAyakaNikA that Thakur did not identify (JN 2nd
ed.49.18-50.19, quoting NyAyakaNikA Pandit ed. 136.4-137.8 = my
dissertation 527.526.7-530.5). RatnakIrti also seemed to be following
NyAyakaNikA more than NyAyavArttikatAtparyaTIkA, but I recall that
influence from the parallel passage in NyAyavArttikatAtparyaTIkA cannot be
ruled out, as RatnakIrti weaves together quotation and paraphrase.
