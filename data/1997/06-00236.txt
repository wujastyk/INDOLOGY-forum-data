Orality etc.: references
I have received a number of private e-mail-messages with reference to my
initial query. They contained the following references to publications
which I thought of general interest: 
Vasudha Narayanan (1984); The Vernacular Veda: Revelation, Recitation
and Ritual. Columbia: University of South Carolina Press (includes,
according to the author, descriptions of how the Tiruvaymoli is learned
and transmitted today).
