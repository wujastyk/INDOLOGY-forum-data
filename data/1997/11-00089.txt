OK. I was using Sanskrit as an illustration, so I mentioned guNa and vRddhi.
I was not implying that Proto-IE followed the same pattern.
I'm not sure I understand what you mean by IE roots not having an intrinsic
vowel.  When you state an IE root, it has a vowel.  Say, for instance, *paa
(Skt. paal); *men (Skt. man); *deik (Skt. dRz); *do (Skt. daa); *dus (Skt.
duS).  There are also IE roots that consist solely of vowels; such as *ai,
*ei, *o.  These can then have different grades.  (I am using Calvert
Watkins' simplified notation).
On the other hand, when you state a Semitic root there are no vowels, one
has to provide them. Yes, there are fixed patterns for applying the vowels,
they are necessary for vocalizing, but they are not part of the root.  In
fact, vowels are not part of Semitic alphabets, whereas IE alphabets (as far
as I know) all include the vowels.  When Semitic alphabets are used for IE
languages, the alpha and the ayin become vowels.  Another illustration of
this is the use of gematria, that is calculating the numerical value of
words.  In Semitic alphabets vowels don't count, in IE alphabets they do.
Good point.
