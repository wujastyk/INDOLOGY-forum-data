Updated version of the earlier announcement of January:
                 SUMMER SANSKRIT at HARVARD.
Like last year, I got several inquiries regarding our offering of
Introductory Sanskrit this summer, -- taught here since 1988.

  This course, equivalent to two semesters of course work, will

  essential vocabulary. Emphasis will also be given to correct 
  translation of passages from simple narrative literature to the epics.
