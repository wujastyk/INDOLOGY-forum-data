	Thanks, Dr. S. Pichumani. 

Oops... I am not even a pill-pusher... much less a 
piler ;-)

	As lover of Carnatic music, you may know that Kavignar 
	Kannadhaasan wrote a long, beautiful lament poem on 
	Tiruvavaduturai N. Rajarattinam Pillai when the musician 
	died. 

Thanks for mentioning ... I have not come across this.  
Along the same lines, there is a really touching irankaRpA 
(eulogy) written by Mahakavi Subramania Bharati on the passing 
away of the great musicologist Subbarama Dikshitar in 1906... 
I have read this in a couple of anthologies of Bharati's poetry.

-Srini.
