The 6 conditions are attributed to Dr. Caldwell and the last line is a direct
quote from the book of Dr. Ilakkuvanar.
In this context, I give below a quotation from A comparative grammar of the
Dravidian Languages by Dr. Caldwell as quoted by Prof. Madhhu.S.
Vimalanandham in his book in Tamil, History of Tamil Literature:
"Tamil however the most highly cultivated Ab-intra of all Dravidian idioms,
can dispense with its Sanskrit altogether, if need be and not only stand
alone, but flourish withhout its aid." Dr. Caldwell.
