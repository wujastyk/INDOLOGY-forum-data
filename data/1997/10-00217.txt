In addition to the Romanized Bible (which is also probably available
from the US Bible Society and those of India and Pakistan as well)
you might check out the publications in Romanized Hindustani of
the British Indian army.  A large and diverse 20th c. corpus is in their
magazine for the jawans, Fauji Akhbar.  Will post further details
later.
