        Yes, that prooves kAmayA is an old syntagm, coming from a 'formula'
(see E. Benveniste, Problemes de linguistique generale 1, chap. 23, on the
delocutive forms). Hence, not necessarily submitted to the standard rules !
        Don't be afraid ! You can't simply give the compound form of a name
without knowing what is his nude form in the mind of your ancient Indian
singer. Moreover, there is the possibility of using case forms in
compounds. If we believe to a delocution, tAra can be an old vocative (see
ved. amba!).
        Following blindly the rules is not the right way : If rAdhA /
rAdhikA, why tArakA and not *tArikA ? If the last A of tArA is not coming
from an H2 (A/i), the nude form tAra is not impossible.
        I'm not sure I'm right, but I'm not sure you're right ;-)
