`Conversational Sanskrit' vs `Real Sanskrit'
Here is one of my pet peeves. There is an increased tendency in many
Sanskrit publications from India, to form the past tense by addition of
sma to the present. Sometimes, whole paragraphs are filled with
constructions like karoti sma, vasati sma, ...... Does this reflect an
unconscious desire among many Indians to recast their past in terms of the
present?!!
