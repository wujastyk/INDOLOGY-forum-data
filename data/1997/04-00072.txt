Just for the record, similar imitations of "barbaric" languages are also
found elsewhere in Greek literature. Mayrhofer in his Handbuch des
Altpersischen quotes a sequence of words from the Acharnoi of Aristophanes,
which he analyzes as an imitation of Persian and even turns into correct
Persian. (see Mayrhofer p. 91).
