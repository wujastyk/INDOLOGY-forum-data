Fahrenheit 451 Clarification
Sorry for the confusion. Memorization was integral to the novel and the
movie. What I meant was, I was unable to find an answer the question of where
Bradbury got the idea of having characters memorize entire books.
Truffaut made his movie of F451 in 1966. Don't know anything about the
Twilight Zone episode.
