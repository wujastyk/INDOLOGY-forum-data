German Indology
"Robert J. Zydenbos" <zydenbos at giasbg01.vsnl.net.in>
Who are these Anglosaxons ?
The Scottish scholar John Brockington actually posted in support of the
booklet. Personally, I have only one complaint about it - I wasn't sent a
copy :-) Most British scholars were conspicuously silent on this matter.
I personally am always very happy to see books on German Indology or any
other kind of Indology - I tend to pick up things I have missed that way.
Dominik Wujastyk was, however, quite right that there is one tendency today
in England to be anti-nationalistic. I don't myself agree with it but it is
definitely there.
I couldn't agree more.
There you go again. 'Anglosaxons'. You mean Americans (and
American-influenced Indians). British scholars are perfectly well aware of
this kind of language chauvinism. (Heavens they are even trying to force us
to change our own language !)  Good British scholars do indeed read works
in other languages and don't, I believe, share the kind of ethnocentricity
you are referring to.
