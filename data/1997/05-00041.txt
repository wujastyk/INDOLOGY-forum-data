hair's colour in sanskrit

I have not read original Kama Sutra but from what I have read it only
talks about heterosexual acts, with a great deal of variety and
unabashed  refinements. While growing up in India I had heard the jokes
and snide remarks about homosexuality only when referring to Muslim
rulers whose religion claims to be derived from Bible too. I did not
find any reference to homosexuality in any of the religious literature
native to India.
Have a peaceful and prosperous day.
