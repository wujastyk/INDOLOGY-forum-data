I would recommend AGAINST BibTex. I used it for several years and was
sorely disappointed and frustrated.  For the last several years I have
used Endnote from Nisus systems (who are based in Berkeley if  I
remember correctly). It -

1. organizes bibliographies (including large ones with tens of thousands
of references) flawlessly; searching is a pleasure here.

2. It comes with a module to interact with Microsoft Word. It is quite
easy to use it.

3. It is cross platform - DOS and Mac users can easily exchange files
without modification on DOS diskettes (which Mac users can easily work
with)

4. Very simple customization can get it to generate LaTeX codes for full
BibTex replacement; once customised (it takes a half an hour) it works
seamlessly with LaTeX

5. It is great for reading in tagged output from commercial databases

6. If you are thinking of using LaTex on the Mac, think of Textures. It
comes with menus which can to a large extent automate the use of LaTeX.
