Etymology of 'tanU'
I agree that the above method of comparison is the best
way to rule out  chance resemblance.  If you have
enough semantic groups like this with basic vocabulary
it would also tend to rule out mass borrowing.  The
most important comparisons are those of grammatical
particles like prefixes and suffixes, which are very
rarely borrowed.
