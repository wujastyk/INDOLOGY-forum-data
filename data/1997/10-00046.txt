Few Questions (Vipulanandar) by Ganesan and an elaboration by              Ramani
There is a small correction in Ganesan's note.  Vipulananda was not an
engineer. He was a physicist with a B.Sc. (London) degree. He made good use
of this subject in his research on the harp.
There is a small correction on Ramani's note. He was not a Professor of
Tamil in Peradeniya. He was the first Professor of Tamil in Ilankai also by
special invitation (he did not apply for the post) in the University of
Ceylon from 1942 to 1947, which was then located in Colombo. The Arts
Faculty was shifted from Colombo to Peradeniya in 1952.
