Oops! ZDMG is a transliteration scheme from "Zeitschrift der
Morgenl\"andischen Gesellschaft" and EL is from "Encyclopedia of Islam."

In Urdu, as well as the other Perso-Arabic scripts, which are alphabetic
in nature, consonants do not have vowel inherency like the Indic scripts
do. So, an Arabic "k" is a pure consonant, explicitly /k/ not /ka/.

Sorry for the ambiguity, I ought to watch my examples.
