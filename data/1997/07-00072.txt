In response to two points made yesterday by Mr. Palaniappan:

Given the previous disclosures about Danielou's mistranslations of the
Kamasutra, I'd not be surprised to learn of equally egregious errors in his
CilappatikAram.  However, I must say, (admittedly before tracking down a
copy of Parthasarathy's translation--thank you for the suggestion) that
your construal of CilappatikAram12:10.1-4) is counter intuitive.

 You propose the following:

>cankamuJ cakkaramum tAmaraik kaiyEnti
>ceGkaN arimAn2 cin2aviTaimEl nin2RAyAl  (12.10.1-4)
>kaGkai muTikkaNinta kaNNutalOn2 pAkattu
>maGkai uruvAy maRaiyEtta vEniRpAy
...
>This is translated as "You stood on the lion with red eyes and the angry bull".
> This means unlike the lines (12.8.2) and (12.9.2), which describe only one
> animal vehicle each, this describes two vehicles.
