beef eating in the Veda
Since you are willing to count as "Vedic" the older Upanisads, then perhaps
the passage in Brhadaranyaka Upanisad (VI.4.18) is relevant.  There it is
said that a man who desires a son learned in the Vedas should prepare a
dish of beef and rice served with ghee and eat it with his wife before
intercourse.  Of course, this is still not an unambigous example of an
"everyday, non-ritualistic food
habit".
