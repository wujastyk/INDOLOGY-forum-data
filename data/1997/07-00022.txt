Yes, my macro package fnpara.sty will do what you want.  This has been
used successfully for editions published from Groningen etc.  There is a
more recent package called footnote.sty or something like that which may
have more options than fnpara.sty, since it is more recent.

For a more complex edition, involving Devanagari, multiple layers of
footnotes (testimonia, variants, etc.), notes in paragraph or 2- or 3-
columns, and coordinated by automatic line numbering, see the package
EDMAC for plain TeX, written by me and John Lavagnino.  This is (in my
extremely modest opinion, of course) the most powerful critical edition
formatting package available, and makes almost any traditional type of
edition layout possible.  See
  http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgadkw/edmac.html
EDMAC has been incorporated into other packages like COLLATE and CET,
which you can read about at the above URL. 

All the best,
Dominik
