As I have underlined above, I wrote vocalic R  *was* pronounced 'ri' in
Orissa. Ofcourse I know it is not so now. I have checked this with an
Oriya scholar (aware of the historical development of the lg), because I
felt the same as you do. He informed me that "ru" pronounciation (together
with other southern influences) came later on to Orissa (evidence is in
inscriptions.
