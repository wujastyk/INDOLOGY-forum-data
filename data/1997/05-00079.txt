Tantraaloka Courses
Regarding Catalin Buiu's request for courses dealing with the 
Tantraaloka, it is correct that Alexis Sanderson at Oxford, who 
specializes in 'Saivatantra, has given some lectures on this text. I do 
not know if this is a regular offering.
I don't know Alex's E-mail address, but his postal address is: All Souls 
College, Oxford OX1 4AL, U.K. Tel.: 44-1865-279396. Fax: 44-1865-279299.
Hope this helps.
Regards,
Joel Tatelman.
