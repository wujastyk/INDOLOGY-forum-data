No, representations with digits is just as mathematical an object

Yes, at the linguistic level, there is also a kind of numeration
system, if you consider "one", "two", "three", "four", ..., "a hundred",
"a thousand", ..., "a million", to be its digits, and "one million
two thousand three hundred twenty [= two tens] (and) three" to be
a sequence of "digits", but that was *not* the numeration system
that I was talking about. In that sense the Indian system (that is
that of the, say, Sanskrit language) is no more positional than that
of Latin or Chinese.
The linguistic numeration systems are never positional, that I know,
so it should have been pretty clear that I did not have that one
in mind.
123 and "one hundred twenty three" are belong to two distinct numeration
systems as sequence of symbols.
You should distinguish the digit 3 and the digit "three". One is a
graphical-symbolic object, the other is a linguistic object.
It should be obvious that the two do not coincide, and neither is
a representation of the other. You don't read "13" as "one three"
but as "thirteen".
