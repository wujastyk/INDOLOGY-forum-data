Apologies from Genevieve Guesdon
Dear list members,
after receiving like you many messages from Genevieve Guesdon
(Biblioth?que Nationale de France, Paris),
I contacted her through phone in Paris and explained to her
how she could unsubscribe from the list
She agreed that I might briefly convey her apologies to you list members
for unwillingly flooding  (she is not very experienced)
your mailboxes with some messages she wanted to send to some
colleague. Hopefully, it will not happen again (it was a nickname
problem ...)
Best regards from Paris
