I am currently reading two nice studies on Chidambaram, the abode of
Nataraja. 1) David Smith, The dance of Siva: religion, art and
poetry in South India, Cambridge university press, 1996
2) Paul Younger, The Home of Dancing Sivan, Oxford university press, 1995

Younger starts his Conclusion as:
"Hinduism is a religion of temples. The picture sometimes still found
in textbooks, which described Hinduism developed around a reading of
the Vedas, was the result of Western Protestant scholars who described what
they wished Hinduism had become".

The comforts of arm chair indology are great. But studying only
few texts, one script, explaining matters with the theory of the day etc., 
have to be changed  if India's true diversity of traditions have to be
grasped. For instance, how many good art history books are written,
how many books on Telugu literature are written? Ah, that involves
going there, involves time, true commitment, etc.,

Very very true.
