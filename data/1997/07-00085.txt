_From my point of view, that's not a problem. mRga and vyAghra (or simha) are
Specifically, therefore, I question your attribution of the adjective
"angry" to the "bull", which should already be dead by the time Durga
stands upon its severed head.  The latter motif was the subject of my
article on the iconography of this goddess as it is found primarily in
Tamilnadu.
Secondly, there seems to be an implicit contradiction between your apparent
rejection of my allusion to lion-riding Ishtar as a precedent, but
acceptance of J.N. Banerjea's reference to the lion-riding goddess Nanaia
(or simply_Nana_) on Kushana coins.  Basically, these are variant names of
the same West Asian goddess, or goddess-type (with warlike nature, riding a
lion) and in proof of this, I quote John Rosenfield, _The Dynastic Arts of
the Kushanas_ (Berkeley:      University of California Press, l967), p 85:
period,...At Dura-Europus there was a vast temple complex, its early phases
datable roughly to the third and second centuries B.C.  In inscriptions
there, the deity was called both Nanaia and Artemis, as she was in
classical literary sources__
Which brings me back to Mr. Thillaud, the modest _etc._ participant in this
thread, who continued in that posting quoted above:
bear...This (doesn't) presume DurgA to be an eurindian Goddess because the
Wild Beast's Lady (correct ? Greek: PotniA ThErOn, French: Dame des Fauves)
is well known in many civilizations. But that can explain why, linked with
DurgA, stags and lions are structurally the same.__
Again, to conclude, and _viva le difference_, I see the Tamil Korravai as
mounted on a deer (not hunting it per se, as does Artemis?), while the
CilappatikAram's poet and roughly contemporary Pallava sculptors are
acutely aware that elsewhere the same goddess rides a lion.
Thank you, Mr. Palaniappan, for reviving this thread, and for the wonderful
Tamil glosses.
