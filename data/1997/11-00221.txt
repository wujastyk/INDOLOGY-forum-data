How does one classify a word as Aryan or Dravidian ??

In Sanskrit the word "pathati" means "to fall" also the word "patha" means Path.

It seems reasonable that pathati and paTu(Tamil) or paDu (Telugu) are related.

paTTi in Kannada means a strip - it could be a 'clearing' also.
Villages/Towns obviously were located in areas which had been cleared of the
shrubs/bushes/trees.
