hindu once again

What ??? Maybe you need to distinguish between the current usage 
of the term by Iranians (and/or their Middle Eastern neighbors) 
and Indians.
At least in India, where there are a good many Parsis, forming 
a distinctive community, 'Parsi religion' clearly refers to 
Zoroastrianism.
