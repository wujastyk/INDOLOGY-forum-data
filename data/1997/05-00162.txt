Dear list members,
Does any of you know the address of the Institute for Advanced Studies of
World Religions (IASWR), New York, that issued a microfiche edition (1990)
of the Kanjur MS from Phug brag housed in the Library of Tibetan Works and
Archives in Dharamsala.
Thank you in advance for your kind help.
