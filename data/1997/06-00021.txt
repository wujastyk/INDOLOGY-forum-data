Subj:	works by/for D.D. Kosambi
Leiden, June 3, 1997
Apparently I do no longer have the query after works by/for D.D. Kosambi in 
my mail archive for easy reference here. 
All four books sought by 'Sreenivas' are present in Leiden collections, 
either at the University Library, or at the Kern Institute Library. 
The only book missing is the one in the microfiche catalogue 
(the memorial volume of 1970).
If interlibrary loan amongst German libraries does not help, then an 
international loan may help out. For more enquiries (also regarding 
interlibrary loans of books from the Kern Institute collection), please 
contact:
University Library, Leiden University

The University Library collection can be 'visited' on line as well.
For more information: Head of Loans, Drs J. Damen, tel. 31-71-5272808.
