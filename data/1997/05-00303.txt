the gods

dear mr. philip
let's not indulge ourselves to much in arguments ad hominem.
first of all, i agree with most of what has been said in this thread on the
issue of 'existence of god(s)'. ontology is not science, it's philosophy. a
scientific discussion can deal with the question WHAT a god is, not THAT a god
is. moreover it's useless: quantumphysics will never be able to prove the
existence of quarks, nor geometry the existence of PI. if anybody wants to
discuss the existence of god(s), let's begin with finding out what we mean
with 'existence' and 'god(s)'
science is as succesfull as it is, because it doesn't need to answere any of
these questions, this makes it possible that f.i. a swedish lutheran and a
buddhist can discuss buddhist texts and cooperate in translating them. those
buddhologists and indologists who gossip about the personal convictions of
their fellow scolars in a scientific debate are simply degrading there own
profession.
a completely different matter however is the motivation for investigating
certain texts or for becoming a buddhologist or whatever in the first place,
which can very well be motivated by personal believes. in most cases it even
improves the results of scientific work. it's called 'the context of
discovery', while the scientific debate is called 'the context of
justification'. this is a duplex ordo which is vital for solid scientific
research and debate.
