There is no real contradiction here: the Jainas tabooed grave and
avoidable himsaa, therefore eating *all* meat became taboo as well, by
implication.

This is why the Jainas considered the Buddhists hypocrites: in the Jaina
view, the Buddhists did not take the commandment of ahimsaa seriously
enough. In polemical writings the Buddhists are depicted as the kind of
people who will not butcher animals but do not mind if others butcher
for them.
