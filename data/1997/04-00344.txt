Ritual and archiecture
I suggest you look at some of the studies of Newar urban space and ritual.
The Newars make much of various spatial orientations of their valley, and
quite explicitly articulate their rituals within that geometry. A good
place to start is
Gutschow, N., and Kilver, B. 1975 _Ordered Space, Concepts and Functions in
a Town in Nepal.
Even more fun, but in German:
Gutschow, N. 1982 _Stadtraum und Ritual der Newarischen Stadte im Kathmandu-tal
Hope this helps.
