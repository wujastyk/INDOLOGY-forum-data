Imperfection of Western Indology (pace Fosse)
What is truly significant in the findings of these scholars (Greg Downing,
Lars Martin Fosse, and Jonathan Silk) is a point suggested, for instance,
by Halbfass viz. Europe's philosophical heritage in Indian thought (India
And Europe: An Essay in Understanding).  
In anagrammic crypto-perfection, then, "no-do-log-why" is the history of
the world's mental awakening -- note, it is not "no tree"-- true to
India's philosophical quest to overcome repeat death, the name points us
to the reasoning within that quest.  And lest we not forget--tat tvam
asi--or the very "forest texts" in which the philosophical thoughts
gleaned and mulled by Hegel for the "weltgeist"  were articulated.  
What has been made clear by Fosse, Downing, and Silk is that Indology is,
indeed the "root." For where would western philosophy be without the ever
present "tree." Whether it stand there to be beheld by Kant or Fichte as
other/same, or whether it fall in presence or absence of an observer, the
tree is stuff of our thought--philosophy is what grows on trees.  From
their limbs fall the apples that catalyzed Newton's innovations.  From
that part of them attached to the ground the Television Miniseries was
born at its "Roots." Even down to the "branches" as we now call them of
the neural net, we--like the Lorax of Dr. Seuss, speak for the trees. 
Arbor Day is really "Honor Indology Day" and the U.S.  Forrestry
Commission is a secret library of MSS used by politicians to perpetuate
their power.

It is ludicrous to consider language as anything other 
than that of which it is the transformation.
