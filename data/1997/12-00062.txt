        I agree for the button's technic, but
1) are other attestations of -kA used with Goddess's names ? I don't found
any *durgakA, *laksSmikA, *srikA, &c. And reNukA is so named because she is
the DAUGHTER of reNu, ambikA and ambalikA are SISTERS of ambA.
2) using the MMW and restraining to the meanigs 'wife of bRhaspati', tArA
and tArakAmaya seem a bit older (MBh) than tArakA (VP), if we must follow
the Indian tradition giving parAzara as the son of vyAsa.
3) in the same MMW, kAmayA is given as a formula 'for the love'.
        Hence, it's not strictly impossible that tArakA would be born from
a false cut of a *tAra-kAmaya-yuddha 'the fight for the love of tArA'.
Going further would need a fine study of the texts (is the word 'kAma' used
significatively in some versions of the story ?) but the Sarma's remark was
perhaps not so stupid ;-)

PS: many thanks to all who send me very interresting answers about the

obtain and read the references you gave me.
