kilns and stupas
I am wondering why ZB XIII.8.1.5 has not (unless I missed it) been
mentioned in this discussion of the origin of stuupas. I have no idea
whether the suggestion of a connection between these easterners and others
of an asura nature who make round tombs instead of square and the later (?)
stuupa is meaningful, but perhaps some of our colleagues do (or can direct
me to the post in which this was discussed, if it was earlier).
