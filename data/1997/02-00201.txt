Indo-Germanic
I don't have either the German or English books (Kulke/Rothermund) at hand,
but I assume what you're referring to is simply a 'Germanism' which has
crept into the English translation. In German, Indo-European is referred to
as 'indogermanisch', literarlly, as you can easily see, 'Indo-Germanic'.
This has nothing to do with any kind of nationalism or whatever, but is
simply due to the fact that, to name the huge linguistic family, in the
German (and, btw, Scandinavian) speaking countries Indo-Germanic was chosen
as it identifies the family as extending from the Indic branch in the East
to the Germanic (Icelandic) in the West. I guess it's just basically a
matter of preference nowadays, but Indo-Germanic is also occasionally found
in English-language texts, especially older ones.
