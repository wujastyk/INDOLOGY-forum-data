Q: Black Draupadi?

	Yes, I agree. I'll try, despite my poor English, to explain my
opinion. That's not a problem for me to believe Draupadi's or Helen's
existence. Being a 'pagan' (there is no words for the old Greek religion)
and a scholar, I have not an uniform conception of the truth or of the
reality: there are not only exoteric meanings but esoteric ones, too. And
history and ethnology are modern sciences, definitely out of this scope and
unable to treat such problems.
	The Heroes of the Greek or Indian epics have a reality because they
are divine models of the human life. But this reality is not an historical
one, we are unable to give them place and date of birth and death, and that
would be stupid to try it! The important is: they are in our past and the
past is teaching our present (history has the same objective but needs
dates, I don't know why).
	About the rapports with Biblical or Babylonian mythologies, I don't
know anything because just eurindian ones are in my scope.
	Regards,

PS: I was very interrested by the mail of Dr Ramkumar, considering the root
kRS- is very simple and give good tracks.
