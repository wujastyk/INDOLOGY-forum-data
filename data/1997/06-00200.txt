"Hindu"
That is not my argument.
Yes they are. Similar flights of fancy are found not only the Puranas
(sorry, but I insist on the plural s), but in all old works, whether Indic
or European.
There is no attested knowledge of historical linguistics in India. Nor was
there any in Europe before the last century. Such things as historical and
comparative linguistics are modern phenomena, discovered in the 19th century.
I did not claim that the knowledge contained in the Puranas has no value.
Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't. It depends upon what the knowledge
concerns.
Mass-murder by laughter always depends upon the audience. An audience
without a sense of humour is not likely to die from uncontrolled laughter.
An audience with a thwarted sense of humour will laugh at the most
unexpected things. In this case, there are good historical arguments for
accepting the traditional view on "hindu". The word is attested as such in
Persian inscriptions at a time when I believe Cape Comorin was unknown to
the Aryans of the North (but here I may be wrong). Thus, death by laughter
is unlikely to happen.
Anyway, if the Puranic wisdom makes you feel better, by all means stick to
it. But you can't expect this view to be taken seriously among historical
linguists.
