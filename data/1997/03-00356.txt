(Fwd) query: Gita tapes
The best chanting I have heard in tape form of the Geeta is that by Swami
Brahmananda.It is produced by the Central Chinmaya Mission Trust,Deenabandhu
Devastanam,CMH Road,Indiranagar,Bangalore 560038 (thats what is stated on
the tape cover).There is very little music in it,and the pronounciation is
very clear.I do not know if there is a CD version.
Vidya.
