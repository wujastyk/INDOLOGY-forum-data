Interesting derivation of California! The late Chandrasekarendra
Sarasvathi of Kanchi Sankaracharya Math also has a derivation for
Alexander. Printed many times in magazines like Kalaimakal
and his collected volumes of speeches.

A rough translation: "Many school children in India cannot pronounce
the word 'school' right. They call it as 'iscool'. In the same manner,
Skanda gets pronounced as 'Iskanda'. We all know that 'Al' is
the equivalent of 'The' in Arabic. Al + Iskanda ==> Alexander".

Note the switching of places between Sikandar and Alexander too!
