The American Oriental Society announces the publication of
     A RGVEDIC WORD CONCORDANCE

This monumental 2-volume work (xii + 1667 pages) lists every
word of the Rgveda in its contextual verse line (pada), including
all instances of preverbs, particles and pronouns.  The Concord-
ance offers an invaluable tool for students of Vedic syntax, lexi-
cography and verse composition, and its clear arrangement
affords a handy conspectus of the linguistic and poetic practices
of the ancient bards of India.  An indispensable work for all
Indologists and Indoeuropeanists!
