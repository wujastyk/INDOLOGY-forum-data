Dear colleagues,
---
I just received an announcement for an Encyclopedia of Hinduism, from
Vedams Books International, New Delhi. It apparently consists of 15 volumes
for $1100 minus 30% discount for libraries and academics (= $770). I am
wondering if anyone is familiar with it and its background. Recently an
encyclopedia of Buddhism appeared from India with pirated and often
uncredited articles, many long outdated, which the surviving authors knew
nothing about.
Is this project more legitimate? 
--- I don't think so;
To me it looks very much the same as its predecessor and I should 
be careful buying it as an individual (As a library, we will have to 
buy it anyway). Also, Vedams seems to have high phantasy-prices only 
to look good in giving 30% reduction. That was so in the case of the
Enc.Buddh.; Fortunately, we asked our own supplier about his price and in 
the end we got the whole work even cheaper than the so called 
reduced price.
So long, Gabriele ----
