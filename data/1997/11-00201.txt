This is *such* an excellent intro to all these scripts.  It is a great
pity it is out of print.
Lambert also did volumes teaching the scripts of South India and Ceylon
(Kannada, Telugu, Malayalam, Tamil, and Sinhala). This used to be
available from the SOAS publications office as a cyclostyled reproduction
of Lambert's typescript.  But SOAS has apparently stopped making this
available and, I believe, no longer even has an original from which to
make copies.
I have a copy, but I am unwilling to lend it.
All the best,
