You are receiving this message because your name is on a list of, at
present, 90 people who, we believe, are interested in announcements
pertaining to the annual Bengal Studies Conference.  If you would like your
name removed from this list, please say so in your reply to this message.

The BSC will be held at Indiana University, May 1-3, 1998.  The official
call-for-papers will come later from Professor Rebecca Manring, organizer
of this year's conference.  The call-for-papers announcement will also be
sent out by David Magier via the usual South Asia lists, so you may receive
more than one copy.  If you leave your name on the BSC email list, you will
not receive a paper copy of the announcement, thereby saving the conference
organizers the cost of paper and postage.
