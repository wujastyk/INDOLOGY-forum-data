Graha epithets (tArA,tArakA and tAraka)

If tAra can represent tArA, I have one interpretation
tArakAmah = one who desires tArA . It is just like `svargakAmah', `bhUtikAmah'
etc.
tArakAmayOh will be possessive dual form i.e., the two who desire tArA
saGgrAmah tArakAmayOh = war of the two who desire tArA
If the visarga at the end is lost and somebody interpreted `O' at the end
as due to transformation of visarga, you will get saGgramah tArakAmayah.
