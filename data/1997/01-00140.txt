You can probably get this edition of the Sabara Bhasyam from:
     Otto Harrassowitz
     Internationale Buchhandlung
     Asien-Abteilung
     Postfach 2929, Taunusstrasse 5
     6200 Wiesbaden
     Germany
but it will cost you plenty. I believe that the Anandasrama edition is still
available for a lot less.
