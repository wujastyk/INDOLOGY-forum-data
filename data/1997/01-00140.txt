South Asia books can not get it.  Does anyone know of a source for it?
Thank you."

You can probably get this edition of the Sabara Bhasyam from:

     Otto Harrassowitz
     Internationale Buchhandlung
     Asien-Abteilung
     Postfach 2929, Taunusstrasse 5
     6200 Wiesbaden
     Germany

but it will cost you plenty. I believe that the Anandasrama edition is still
available for a lot less.
