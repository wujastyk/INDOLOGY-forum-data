I am having difficulty referencing the following three passages in the
Upanisads (because the translations I am working with are so different).
Can someone please provide the references. Thanks a lot.

(1) from Manduka Upanisad (   ): "The syllable OM, which is the 
imperishable brahman is the universe."

(2) from Manduka Upanisad (   ): "The Fourth, the Self, is OM, the
indivisible syllable. This syllable is unutterable and beyond mind. In it
the manifold universe disappears. It is the supreme good--One without a
second. Whosoever knows OM, the Self, becomes the Self." 

(3) from Brhadaranyaka Upanisad (   ) : "The Self is described as not
this, not that." 



Cordially,

Sushil Mittal
