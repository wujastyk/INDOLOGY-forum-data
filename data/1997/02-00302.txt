German Indology

I took it so.
Apologies to John Brockington if he objects to being referred to as a
Scottish scholar. I have obviously misremembered something I thought he
said when I visited him in Edinburgh a couple of years or so ago.
Perhaps however we should discontinue this thread which obviously no longer
has much to do with Indology ? Our Moderator, having been to some extent a
participant, is perhaps not in a position to exert his authority this time ?
