A Sanskrit text on burglary?
Commenting on a reference in an Old Tamil text, U.V. Saminathaiyar says that
a Sanskrit text on burglary is called "steeya s'aastra" and the author of the
text was "karNisuuta" and he was the teacher of one 'kaca". I have
transliterated the terms given in the Tamil text as best as I could. Can
anybody give the correct Sanskrit names for these and any information about
these names?
Thanks.
