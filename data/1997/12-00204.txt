That is a very interesting suggestion indeed (PANini4.3.74: tata AgataH,

But then, in order to include the Skanda-TAraka myth, we should not
translate *(a battle) for the sake of tArA*, but *(a battle) caused by a
star (or: by stars) (tArakA)*.
On the other hand, -maya has normally the meaning *consisting of*, and hetu
might just mean *material cause*. The grammarians give as examples
Devadatta-maya and VAyudatta-maya to account for -manuSyebhyo in P. 4.3.81,
but what does that really mean? I found BhImasenamaya in MahAbhArata
5.50.25 and 11.11.14, but here the meaning is nothing but *consisting of
BhImasena* (in a simile). Can you (or anyone else) give an example from the
literature for the actual use of -maya in the sense *for the sake of* or
*caused by*?
Otherwise I would still think that Amaya was originally intended,
especially since Ya. Vassilkov (thank you for your elucidating message
which arrived just now when I was writing this!) now found this
interpretation attested with NIlakaNTha.
