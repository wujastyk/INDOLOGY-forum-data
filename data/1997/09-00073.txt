Imperfection of Western Indology (pace Fosse)
It is difficult to add anything of significance to the most excellent
commentaries of the pundits Jonathan, Lars, Greg, JR, and others.  So then,
what about the In-do-log-y list?  I wish to submit that it is now evident
that it provides the means to LOG-on to true knowledge, to infinity, to
being as well as non-being, and to what was there before being and
non-being!  Some might even call it the Aquarian Soma. (have you landed
safely, Dominik?)
