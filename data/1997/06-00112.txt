Subject: ADMIN: controlling INDOLOGY
Message-ID: <161227030842.23782.670317547506395626.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Frank Conlon has kindly pointed out that I gave a wrong instruction in my
message of a week or two ago, when I set out the commands for controlling
INDOLOGY.

To "switch off" INDOLOGY for a while, i.e., while you go on a trip, send
the message 

    set indology mail postpone

to the address 

    listproc at liverpool.ac.uk

I had said "set indology postpone" by mistake.

Sorry everyone!  And thank you Frank.

All the best,
Dominik

Dominik:

This is a minor point now, although it has created a lot of confusion for
me today.  In your May 22 post, you left out the word "mail" from the
command  of "set indology mail postpone" and had "set indology postpone"
instead.  I tried it with upper case, lower case, even left out set, and
finally asked indology-request for help, but as no one appeared, I went
back and asked for the "help set" document from the list processor, that
was when I realized that the correct posting is

set indology mail postpone.

I'd recommend that you might share that correction with the other indology
members who may think about setting the list for nomail over the summer.

cheers,

Frank
