Studies in Ancient Indian Architectture
Hi everybody, 
Can anybody suggest publications that give a comprehensive view of the
research done on Architecture and arts in the ancient times, in last 50
years. I am interested in studies that address architectural treatises and
methods (vastu purusha mandala and others) in temple design, town planning
and residential design. I have been referring to the paper by Pramod
Chandra, titled 'The study of Indian Temple Architecture' published in
1975. Anything that lists research in last decades will greatly help. 
Thanks,
sincerely,
D E E P A K     G U P T A
