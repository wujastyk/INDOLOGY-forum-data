Tamil aaytam

      Re: Tamil aaytam [aaydam] identified as PD laryngeal
      *****************************************************
There are few papers on aaytam in Proceedings of Word Tamil conferences,
I think. A word `kahRu' has meanings of a type of color or sound.
Nammalvar (9th century) uses aaytam in a context where it should sound as 'y'.
Look at the etukai/prAsam/second syllable in each line.

In certain TirukkuRals, aaytam is treated as a vowel while in others
it acts as a consonant in metrical computations (yAppilakkaNam).

The process described by Prof. Bh. Krishnamurti is used effectively
by Turaimangalam CivappirakAcar (17th century). He is a Veerasaivaite.
He narrates the birth of Basavanna.
For all words ending with 'l', if a word starting with 't'
comes to merge with it, 't' will change to 'R'.
(example: kal + taLi = kaRRaLi = stone temple, etc.,)
This general rule has an additional possibility for few words. For the
joining of few words ending with the letter 'l' with words
starting with letter 't', 'l' will become 'h'.
It is a rare occurence. Even after 'l' changing to 'h',
't' will become 'R' (retroflex) as before never minding it is 'h'
that is in the front and not 'l'. Old habits die hard!
(example: pal + taanai = paRRaanai = pahRaanai)
Devas were praying to Basava when he is in Kailasam. This is like
t becoming R after seeing l.
Devas continue to pray to Basava when he descends to Earth in human form.
This is like t becoming R even after seeing h, instead of the usual l.
An instance of grammar taking the form of literature,

       n^aRumalar viziyin kaNtavar ellAm
