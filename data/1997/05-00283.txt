the gods
George Thompson writes (first quoting Howard Resnick):
I hope you'll see, George, that you are very clearly misrepresenting Howard
here. The epithet "hopeless logical positivist" in his view (and, I may add,
in mine) goes *not* to someone who denies a god's existence on *religious*
grounds, but to someone who tries to do so on *scientific* grounds. Science
has no say on matters which are beyond investigation; a scientist may
certainly speak on them (as may anyone else), but he does so (like everyone
else) from a perspective of personal belief. Such a statement is of a
religious or metaphysical nature, not scientific, and I believe that is what
Howard wished to point out.
The rest of the "unintelligible" comments you quote appeared quite clear and
intelligible to me. Is there some personal ill-feeling that makes you not
want to see his point?
