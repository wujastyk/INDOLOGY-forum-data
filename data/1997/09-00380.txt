I would like to thank everybody who answered my email concerning laybacks
for their effort. Special thanks to David Dargie, who has given us an
invaluable insight into Australian culture, although he was'nt the only one
to explain what a layback is.

If you are bemused why I asked the question, the answer is that I am doing a
translation for the Foreign Office concerning how to control public
drinking. (Ideas for publicans and similar people). The layback concept is
new to me, but it sounds like one of those things that make you want to be
young again.

Cheers!
