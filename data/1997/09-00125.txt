David!
 Could you please ask this gentleman as to whether this is some kind of 
a family belief or is it some belief in the area where he come from? I 
know there are families where it is wrong to kill snakes, the story is 
that the snake curses the family causing its children to have
a funny skin coloration- I remember reading about a family in 
Maharashtra which had this tale to tell....I don't think there is 
anything generic religious belief about this.....
Looking forward to your reply,
Krishna
