A Special Issue of Information Processing & Management
on
Information Retrieval with Asian Languages

Interest is growing in effective and efficient retrieval of relevant
information  from large unstructured databases.  Research in information
retrieval (IR) has  expanded its scope widely with advances in related
areas such as natural language  processing, machine learning, and
man-machine interactions.  Especially with the  explosion of information in
the World Wide Web, the need for information retrieval  and related
functions has become ubiquitos regardless of languages and cultures.   This
special issue will be devoted to research and development in information
retrieval with Asian languages. Suggested topics include, but are not
limited to:
- retrieval or routing of texts at variouls levels of granularity
- cross-language text retrieval
- automated text categorization
- infomation extraction
- automatic text summarization (including automatic abstracting)
- use of machine readable dictionaries and/or thesauri
- language- or task-specific user interfaces for IR-related
  systems
- various natural language processing techqniques for IR-related
  tasks
