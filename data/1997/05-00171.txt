yuga, VarNa and colour
And what can we make of the fact that the sum of the units 
in each of these numbers = 9? eg. 1 728 000 = 
1+7+2+8=18=1+8=9?  This is true of so many of the "indic" 
numbers we come across -- the japa mala of 108 beads,etc. 
Are there any specific references to this number in the 
ancient literature? Or should we look to the 3?
