                COLOR OF SKIN
               **************

Prof. P. Claus wrote:

Can anybody please give some references? I want to know how black color
of skin is associated with things mean from Indian writings.

Interestingly, I heard from a student at Columbia university that
why Blacks detested the word, "Nigger"? Nigger, it seems in Latin
 not only means black, but "evil". He informed me: the humanistic philosopher
Nietzsche discusses this in his famous book, "Beyond Good
and Evil". Any relevent passage from Nietzsche's writings will be appreciated.

Any parallel thoughts from Sanskrit works? Manu? smricandrika?
chaturvargachintAmaNi? Any subaltern research papers on how Shudras 
were denigrated in Indian elite writings?

Thanks,
N. Ganesan
