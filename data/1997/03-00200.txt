"Protestant"
I think Ambedkar's neo-Buddhist movement can be classified as a
quintessential protestant movement. So may also be the movement of Sri
Narayana Guru of Kerala. 
The movement of Ramalinga aTikaL of Tamilnadu (1823-1874) can also be
classified as protestant even though one can see it as following the medeival
protestant movements of the Tamil Siddhas. For details, you can see "The
Mission and Message of Ramalinga Swamy" by T. Dayanandan Francis, 1990,
Motilal Banarsidass Publishers.
