Atharva Veda info request
Dear Dr. Deshpande:
I forwarded your request for the chaturvedi contact information to my
friend. It appears that he would prefer to consult his guru before
revealing his contact information.
This is his response:
I urge you to correspond with aravind regarding this.
With regards
Ravi

Subhaashitam: (Ancient Sanskrit Couplet)
||Kshamaa balam a-shaktaanaam; shaktaanaam bhUshaNam kshamaa|
  Kshamaa vashikrte loke, kshamayA: kim na sidhyati ? | ||
Subhashitasya anuvaadam (Translation):
Forgiveness is the strength of the weak.
Forgiveness embellishes the mighty.
In a world that can be conquered by forgiveness,
what is not possible by forgiveness?
