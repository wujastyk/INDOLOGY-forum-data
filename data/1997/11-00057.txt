I have read this discussion with some amusement.  For my own personal use I
write x for visarga and w (sic!) for anusvAra just because I'm too lazy to
hit shift.
These are easy to replace later with a search-and-replace routine,
especially if the whole file is in Sanskrit.
 OTOH I use C rather than z for the palatal sibilant, because using z for
this value gives me aesthetical jolts, and because in Tibetan I'm used to
have to distinguish:
 c-j (alveopalatal affricates)
 C-J (dental affricates)
 S-Z (alveopalatal sibilants)
 s-z (dental sibilants)
 $ (for the rare retroflex sound in Sanskrit words)
 h (historically a voiced h)
 H (the same as a subscript for vowel length)
 x (Tibetan voiceless velar fricative, but used for Sanskrit h!)
 X (visarga in Sanskrit words)
Gha-le!
