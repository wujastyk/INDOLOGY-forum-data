My statements should be seen in context and contrast to that which they
were ment to answer.  Bogus scholarship aimed at political ends surely
helps nobody.  I for one am convinced that scholarship no more than
anything else exists in some kind of ideological vacuum.  We better be open
about this fact.

I never claimed anything of the sort.  I've seen social stagnation on four
continents and live with it daily in northern Europe.

If I have offended you I beg your pardon.  I only spoke my heart wrt
certain postings to this list that were self-righteous, if anything is.

Me to.

What do you mean by 'keep the people out of Indology research'? That
Indology should be elitist, only open to an elite and only deal with elite
culture?  I doubt that anything useful can be said on anything that has to
do with culture if one is leaving out social issues.

Well, I know that I can be rather passionate sometimes.  I better stick to
linguistic matters -- hopefully a different passion with a clearer truth...
