Unicode Script management
TITUS is now testing UNICODE script management. For this purpose, we have
prepared some test pages containing a full account of UNICODE characters
with their  equivalents in UTF-8 (the pages themselves are encoded using
UTF-8). They can  be used to check for your WWW browser's capabilities as to
representing  UNICODE / UTF-8 encoding.
We have sample pages containing mixed transcriptional text in Avestan,
Middle Persian and Sanskrit and some sample texts for Classical Sanskrit &
Vedic Sanskrit
