indology mss. and intellectual property rights
The issues are larger than mere copyright issues.
WTO members are still debating the issues related to
the preservation and protection of traditional
knowledge systems. There was a case in the USA when
Donald Trump was given the right to use TAJMAHAL as
his TradeMark. There were also cases involving the
patenting of neem and turmeric products.
I suppose world heritage documents should be cherished...
with due regard to national sentiments. Laws and international
agreements will evolve within this framework.
