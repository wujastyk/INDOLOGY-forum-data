The story being mentioned here is that of "kuNTalakEci" a Buddhist work which
is one of the five major epics of Tamil literature (in this the protagonist-
heroine becomes a Buddhist nun) most of which is lost. On the other hand,
nIlakEci, a minor epic, which has survived is a Jain work (the protagonist-
heroine becomes a Jain nun).
