        (I upcase)

Fine! I would agree.
        But why so many posts about today's India (forwarded newspapers,
feasts, calendars, politics, hindi's or tamil's problems, &c.) ?
        The first question from Lars Martin Fosse was a very excusable
transgression, but why so many people don't answered him privately ?

        Best regards,
