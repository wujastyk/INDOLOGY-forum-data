The British Association of South Asian Studies will hold a conference in
Manchester, 17th-19th April 1998. An announcement will appear in the
October BASAS Bulletin.

I have been asked to convene a panel on Sanskrit studies, so if you are
within reach of Manchester and can offer a paper in this field I shall be
glad to hear from you. BASAS is mainly interested in the contemporary
world, politics, sociology, etc., so a paper that bridges the artificial
gap between 'indology' and 'South Asian studies' would be particularly
welcome.

BASAS offers a prize for an outstanding paper by a young scholar at the
conference: see below.

I am also planning the 15th day conference on the Sanskrit Tradition in
the Modern World (STIMW) at Newcastle upon Tyne on Friday, 22nd May 1998.
Papers will be circulated in advance, and discussed at the conference
without being read out. Please let me know if you are interested,
particularly if you can offer a paper.
