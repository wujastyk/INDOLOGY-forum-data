I wonder if there is an uneven distribution (is this the terminology?) of
the words nIla and kRSNa: if something or someone can be called nIla as
well as kRSNa, the darkness is beautiful and good; if he, she, or it is
only called kRSNa is is bad and ugly.  kRSNa I think means (in English
color-divisions) black only; nIla blue, black, or even a dark purple
leaning towards blue rather than black.

Re desire for daughters:  The Karmavipaka literature clearly regards
having no daughters as a bad thing, though obviously not as bad as having
no sons.  I think it would regard the seven sons and three daughters that
Job got after his trials as a good thing (though maybe two would be even
better). I recall from my elementary S.  Asia anthropology course from
Cora Du Bois that one is not regarded as a fully adult man until one has
married off a girl, and daughterless men therefore will sometimes take the
leading role in arranging and paying for the wedding of a niece or a
friend's daughter.
