I can confirm that tobacco, tomatoes, chillies and potatoes were brought
back from the Americas by the early European explorers and from there
disseminated to Asia.

>thinking, here, of the non-inhaling forms of tobacco smoking (pipe &
>cigar), as distinguished from the noxious effects of cigarettes.
