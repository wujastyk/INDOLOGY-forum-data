Apple Indian language kit
The Apple Indian language kit supporting Devanagari (plus Gujarati and
Punjabi scripts) was released earlier in 1997. Has anyone on this list used
it to prepare camera-ready copy? Maybe they could share some comments on
what it's like and whether the investment has been worth it.
I'm particularly keen to know if it works well with PageMaker 6.5.
