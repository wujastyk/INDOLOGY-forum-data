Bhadrakalpalataavadaana
Dear Prof. Vassilkov,
I am delighted to learn that you are going to be working on Sergei Oldenburg's papers! I am sure there is much of interest to discover there.
In his monograph on the Bhadrakalpaavadaana, Oldenburg does thank Sylvain L?vi and the Soci?t? Asiatique for the loan of the BKA manuscript. This would suggest that he used it and eventually returned it. Filliozat's catalogue only states that it is no longer in the Soci?t?'s collection because it was loaned to Oldenburg.
In any case, my sincere thanks for your offer to 'look around' for the BKA manuscript. I look forward to hearing from you.
If I can be of any assistance to you please do not hesitate to ask.
Sincerely yours,
Joel Tatelman.
