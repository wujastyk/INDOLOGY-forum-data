Although I do not know of a standalone TrueType font for Urdu, you might
want to have a look at Sadaf for Windows, a word-processor which uses two
Nasta`liq TTF fonts to produce the Urdu output. This program is a real gem
as it produces the Nasta`liq output as you type it in, ligatures and all.
The URL for the Sadaf page is:

A free copy of Sadaf for Windows may be obtained from the above site.

that I think it's a real beaut! :-) *
