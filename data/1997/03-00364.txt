(Fwd) query: Gita tapes
I have a recording of Bhagavad GItA chanted by the three famous Mohapatra
sisters, in the same style as their numerous tapes of Vi.s.nu SaharanAmastotra
that is very clearly chanted text with a little musical background.
It comes as a set of 4 audio cassettes which I bought for 100 rupees in Puri.
It is copyrighted 1991 Gathani Records Company, 2 Temple Street, Calcutta
700 072.
