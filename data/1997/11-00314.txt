Subject: etymol. final r, s / optionality of ext. sandhi?
Message-ID: <161227034007.23782.8639978280320992064.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

1. It is simply a rule (a linguist will explain
you better):
Aorist has 3. plur. (Par.)  ur
Aorist hast 2./3. sgl. (Par.) iis/iit

2. And another important rule: In Pausa -s/-r
always changes to Visarga
