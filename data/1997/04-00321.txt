Of course, "vii.tukku poo_nava_n naa_n" would be more literally translated
something like: "The one who went home am I." And this is hardly a typical
everyday past tense construction -- just as, we may add, the Sanskrit past in
-tavant is unusual.

But passive constructions in the Dravidian languages are cumbersome and little
used, which is a reason why South Indians (and not only they: me too!) have
difficulties in using the Urdu-Hindi past tense of transitive verbs, which is
historically a passive. So it is understandable that they would gladly avoid
common Sanskrit constructions like "mayaa pustakam pa.thitam", with the agent
in the instrumental case, in favour of "aham pustakam pa.thitavaan", where the
agent is in the nominative case and the object in the accusative, as in
Dravidian. And Kannada "naanu pustakavannu oodidavanu" and Tamil "naa_n
puttakattai pa.tittava_n" ("I am [the] one who read a book") superficially mean
the same as the Sanskrit sentence, have the same word order, and also the
endings resemble each other phonetically, which is helpful in memorizing the
construction. Furthermore, avoiding a conjugated active past-tense verb form by
using a verbal agentive noun reduces the amount of grammar which the learner
needs to learn and thus further simplifies this neo-Sanskrit.
