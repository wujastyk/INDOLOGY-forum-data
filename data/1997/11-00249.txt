Eurindian or Dravidian ?

        About skr. "idam"
There are difficulties to reconstruct Eurindian pronominal forms because
they are subject to many agglutinations and suppletions, and because they
involves very short (frequently monophonematic) particles. Many details can
be found in F. Bader's work but, here, the situation is almost clear:
        1) we can't separate "id-am" from "tad" and "ad-as", direct neutral
forms and bases for compounds (tatpuruSa, idaMvid, adomUla).
        2) we can't separate "id-am" from "id-A"
        => "idam" seems to be a redondant direct neutral form from *id
        this *id can be analysed *i-d,
        where -d is a neutral pronominal desinence, as in skr. "ta-d", lat.
"istud", got. "that-a" (engl. "that"), gr. "ho" (< *yod, attested before
enclitic by homeric hotti < *yod-ti)
        and where i- is an affirmation particle (probably linked with the
suffix -i) we can see in ved. "id" (= "eva") and in skr. "iti". (Remark:
the existence of vedic "id" justify the necessity of the casual redondance
"id-am" to avoid ambiguities)
        This reconstruction is well sustained by
        the vocabulary: lat. "id", got. "it-a" (engl. "it"), old Irish "ed".
        the flexion: lat. neutral "id", masc. "is" ; got. neutral "it-a",
masc. "is".
        (Remark: lat. "idem" (= same) is not skr. "idam", but *i(s)-dem
where *dem is an other particle (identity), as in "ibidem" and many others.)
