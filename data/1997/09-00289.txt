Aalim aalam
Could someone help me to find out what "Aalim aalam" means in Islam? Some
students have come across this term and have approached me for its meaning.
I have absolutely no idea what that can mean.   Is it a coranic or islamic
concept? Or could it be some new islamic  computer software?  Thanks.  A.
