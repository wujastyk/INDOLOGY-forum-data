I recall hearing in a paper presentation by Prof. R.S. Sharma (historian,
J.N.U.) at the Leipzig World Sanskrit Conference (1979) that he had tried
to estimate the size of the population in A;soka's time on the basis of the
number of prisoners taken in the Kali:nga war. I do not know -- and do not
have the time to find out -- if Prof. Sharma has included the results in
any of his publications.
