VarNa and colour

The texts usually identify the four yugas with the four colors, and as the
varnas are sometimes associated to the yugas, the relation is probably
indirect.  It is a symbolical correspondence that is frequently applied to
sets of four.
According to the Mbh, the color of Narayana/Visnu/Krsna throughout the yugas
is white, red, yellow and black (Mbh 3.148.16,23,26,33); but soon after it
is said to be white, yellow, red and black (Mbh 3.187.31).
