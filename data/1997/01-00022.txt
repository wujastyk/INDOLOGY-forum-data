The following lines are placed in the list on behalf of Prof. Emmerick.

In Khotanese texts Buddhist Aacaaryas sometimes are given the titles dviilai or 
traviilai, meaning "Knower of two pit.akas" and "Knower of three pit.akas". Does 
anyone know what precisely lies behind these titles? Are they known from other 
sources? I would be grateful for any suggestions.
