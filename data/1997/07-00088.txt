 From the South Indian languages, we have "curry" ( from Tamil/Malayalam 
"Kari", "Mulligtawny" soup ( from Tamil "Mizhakku taNNIr"), 
"catamaran"(from Tamil),"bandicoot"( from Telugu pandi kokku) etc etc. 
 It is very important to keep these historical periods in mind when one 
examines borrowed words from one culture onto another.
