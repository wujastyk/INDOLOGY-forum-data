bodhi- correction
It seems to me that Geldner interprets bodhi as from the root bhuu. We would
then have to reconstruct something like *bhuH-dhi (compare yu;n-dhi for yuj)
with an irregular guna in the second person sg., cf. irregular second person
plural imperatives like e-tana, braviitana, stota, han-tana instead of itana
etc. (See Macdonell p. 142). Since *bhuH-dhi contains to aspirates, the
first i deaspirated (cf. *bhudh- > *budh). This should give bodhi.
Hope I am not totally off the mark.
