"nee
       Yes,  navarOj spans between mandra sthAyi panchama to
       madhya sthAyi panchama. I have some notes about the
       history of this rAga , whicjh I will post in a da day or two.

       The amara kOs'a goes like
       "nishAdarshbha gAndhAra shadja madhyama dhivatAh
         panchamashEtyamI sapta tantrI kaNThOttitAh svarAh "
        In the order of mentioning Shadja comes fourth, but I do
        not know if it is of any consequence.
         The few pAdas that follow the above mentioned shlOka are
         shadjam mayUrO vadati gAvO rishabha bhAshiNah
         ajA vikantu gAndhAram krounchah kvanati (?) madhyamam
         pushpa sAdhAranE kAlE pikah kUjati panchamam
         dhaivatama hasato vAji nishAda bruhmatE(?) gajah ....
         These assign shadja to peacock, rishabha to bull, gAndhAra
          to sheep, madhyama to kroucha pakshi, panchama to koel,
          dhaivata to horse and nishAda to elephant.
           These assignments have been probably quoted from
           Bharata's nATya shAstra.
