Compare Jain. Life in ancient India as depicted in the Jain canon p. 45 with

It has been stated that a Brahmana who had committed certain crimes should be 
branded with an image of a dog (sunaga) or a kundiya pot on his head..

See Taittiriya Brahmana 3.8.4.2 for relevant passage, which gives its own
