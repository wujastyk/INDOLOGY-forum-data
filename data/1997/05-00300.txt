under consideration forms an important part of his tradition.  From there
on, I, and anyone else, is free to give whatever weight or place one wishes
to the translator's/commentator's words.
What I said above is also true about texts of any religion, when the
translation/commentary is made by someone who has a stake in the tradition
itself.  It can often be a limiting factor, but, depending on what we are
researching, it can also provide useful insights into certain aspects of the
tradition.
But it is also difficult (although, I guess not entirely impossible), as
others have already stated, to completely disengage oneself from deeply held
religious beliefs and become a scholar of religion as if one were not a
participant.  Howard's words sounded to me like a defense against a
perceived attack on those who chose to believe in a certain god.
My posting was not an attack either on Howard Resnick nor on his beliefs.
But his words about a "hopeless logical positivist"  did seem to me as an
unwarranted attack on others.  As far as I can tell, nobody on the list was
attacking religion and defending science, positivism or whatever, so I don't
see the need for such an intense defense of one's right to believe in Agni,
Zeus, Quetzalcoatl, Thor, or any other god.  Not on this list, at any rate.
And, anyway, who is to judge that a "logical positivist" (which, by the way,
I'm not) is more hopeless than a religious believer.
Best,
