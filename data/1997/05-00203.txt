	Existence of numeration systems in the oldest known documents show
us arithmetic is extremely old. Surely before Chinese was Chinese and
Indians was Indians.
	Surely mill-games are too very old (see the very elaborate wei-ki
in China) and the smallest, the tic-tac-toe, has nine intersections. And
the making of nets and baskets generates many squares. The simplest games
need an odd number of plays to give a winner, &c. I believe improbable that
any of the civilizations known today be the 'inventor' of the small numbers
and of their elementary properties. Using stone tools and living in caves
is not a proof of stupidity. And Lucy is a very very old woman ...
