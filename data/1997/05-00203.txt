	Are Egyptians a central asian tribe ? They count the Gods by enneads.
	Existence of numeration systems in the oldest known documents show
us arithmetic is extremely old. Surely before Chinese was Chinese and
Indians was Indians.
	Surely mill-games are too very old (see the very elaborate wei-ki
in China) and the smallest, the tic-tac-toe, has nine intersections. And
the making of nets and baskets generates many squares. The simplest games
need an odd number of plays to give a winner, &c. I believe improbable that
any of the civilizations known today be the 'inventor' of the small numbers
and of their elementary properties. Using stone tools and living in caves
is not a proof of stupidity. And Lucy is a very very old woman ...
