(1)  The first passage that you quote seems to be a conflation of the first
two verses of the Mandukya.
ie. M1   ...   aum ity etad aksharam idaM sarvaM
             ...  "Aum, this very syllable, is all this."
and M2  ... sarvaM hy etad brahmA ...
              ... "All this is verily brahma"
(which is itself a quotation from the Brhadaranyaka II.v.19)
Perhaps your first passage would be better rendered
 "The syllable OM (which is the imperishable brahman) is the universe."
This would then doubtless be the opening statement of Mandukya 1.
(2)  Your second passage is certainly Mandukya 12, ie the closing statement.
(3)  As for the "neti neti" passage, try Brahdaranyaka II.iii.6.
