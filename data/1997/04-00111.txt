Nietzsches source could be Schopenhauer, who knew the Sanskrit-Literature
and loved the Bhagavadgita.
And Nietzsche knew Schopenhauer very well. So I can imagine that he had this
terms from Schopenhauer.
In 'Beyond Good and Evil' there are some polemic sections against
Schopenhauer. Perhaps this section is one of them.


Good luck,
