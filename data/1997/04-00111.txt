Nietzschegati
Nietzsches source could be Schopenhauer, who knew the Sanskrit-Literature
and loved the Bhagavadgita.
And Nietzsche knew Schopenhauer very well. So I can imagine that he had this
terms from Schopenhauer.
In 'Beyond Good and Evil' there are some polemic sections against
Schopenhauer. Perhaps this section is one of them.
Good luck,
Arash
