ANNOUNCE: Update of Sanskrit Introductory sktintro.ps

The Sanskrit Introductory course has been updated (minor rephrasing 
and typo correction, but substantially the same).  The "compress" 
option of dvips has been used: this make the file marginally slower 
to print but the result is a 75% reduction in file size (from 5.7Mb 
to 1.3Mb). It is also both viewable under ghostscript and directly 
printable on a printer with a PostScript interpreter.

The original announcement message giving the Table of Contents and
Preface in ASCII text is also available.

The files are available by anonymous ftp at:

      ftp://ftp.nac.ac.za/wikner/sktintro-announce.txt
      ........................../sktintro.ps600-letter-march97
      ........................../sktintro.ps600-a4paper-march97

The difference between the last two files is that the former is 
optimised for double-sided printing on U.S. letter paper, and the 
latter for European A4 size paper.

The above site is rather overloaded: you may find the Jaguar 
temporary site more accessible:

      ftp://t.ms.uky.edu/incoming/sktintro-announce.txt
      .........................../sktintro.ps600-letter-march97
      .........................../sktintro.ps600-a4paper-march97

Charles Wikner.
