My warm thanks to all those who supplied information about the Marathi
repha.   

Since there are words whose meaning depends on which repha is used (per
Avinash Sathaye and Ashok Aklujkar, both on Oct 29, 1997), it is clearly
essential to have a separate transliteration for the eyelash repha.    With
~r being used in the Velthuis 7-bit scheme, it would seem appropriate to
use r_tilde in the 8-bit case.
