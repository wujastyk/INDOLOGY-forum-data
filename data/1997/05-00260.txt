(Fwd.) Max Mueller (Part 2 of 2)
In response to Howard Resnick's remarks:
It seems to me that if a Vedic poet, say DIrghatamas, is capable of
doubting the existence of Agni, among a number of other gods, then we
should be able to be a little tolerant of Greg Downey's apparent doubts,
especially since he hedges them with a parenthesis: "(for the sake of the
argument)."
Also, if I recall, it is very Vedic to be polite to guests.
Sincerely,
George Thompson
