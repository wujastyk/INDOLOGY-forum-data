the problem however is, that if entities are not bound by human restrictions
and their motives are beyond human understanding, they're as obsolete as a
perpetuum mobile. whatever they'll do will be completely unreasonable and
accidental to humans. maybe the wales are jIvan mukTas: we'll never know!
Meister Eckhart cannot have been a jIvanmukTa, because he knew very well he
was human and bound by human restrictions and laws, but he didn't mind.
next time you see a jIvanmukTa you better cut his troat
