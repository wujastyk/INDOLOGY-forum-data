These MLBD Newsletter reports tend to be of various quality...  
It is well known to everyone here that names of Aryan-like deities were
recorded in texts from Anatolia etc. 
What is new to me is the shaven head with a tuft.  Though I do not suffer
the pathological wish to interpret everything that bears similarities as 
"Vedic/Sanskritic influence" I'd be interested to know whether this type
of "hair-dress" (or hair-undress :-) in finds from Turkey is attested in
some more reliable sources.  Anybody knows ?
