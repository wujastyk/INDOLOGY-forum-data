Subject: Language name 'Koslakhi'
Message-ID: <161227030017.23782.3439568088967429659.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Does anyone know of a language named Koslakhi, probably from India?  It
does not appear in refernce books such as Ethnologue or in the lists of
languages in the Linguistic Survey of India or the Census of India.  A
commercial firm is trying to find a speaker, or what language it is a name
for, or dialect of, or close to, so that a person whose native language it
is can be deposed in a legal matter.


Thanks for any help you can give me.
