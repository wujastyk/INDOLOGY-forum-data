And we know that h cannot happen after a stop (Fr. occlusive) if for

If there was a problem they'd have uncovered it by now :) Now some may
think this is more like a spit-and-string proof that h cannot follow
stops in Sanskrit, but one shouldn't be picky :) In conclusion: ok.
If by "the choice between them results form reverse assimilation" you
mean it's visarga before unvoiced phonemes or in pausa, ha before voiced
phonemes, then again, yes. I believe that D.H.Killingley made the same point.
As usual. Silence is allless.

No! Don't! I won't! As far as I can tell this works fine for Sanskrit.

I don't know what a "bijAkSarA" is.
How is "hsauh" used? Is it an onomatopoeia?
In any case we were dealing only with Sanskrit. If we wanted to
deal with all languages written with Nagari who knows what other
surprises we'd be in for! :)
Note that it seems "hsauh" could be taken care of by saying that at
the initial it's always h -- indeed no find visarga there.
But let's not, because that would only encourage you! :)

Thanks to one and all who've helped me with this.
