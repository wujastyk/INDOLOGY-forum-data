Graha epithets (tArA,tArakA and tAraka)

I'm not a student of indian languages either but as a native speaker of
english and as a woman I feel I could make some comments about being
"honeyed". The situation usually arises when some man addresses a woman
with those forms of pseudo endearment such as "Honey" or "Baby" which
tend to be belittling and are also americanisms. If the reply to this is
"Don't honey me", the "honey" is actually in quotes, referring to the
previous comment. It's not being used as a verb.
Whether 'honey', 'encore' or 'yes' can be converted to verbs in the US I
can't say, but it certainly sounds strange in Australia.
