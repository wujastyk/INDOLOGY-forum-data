Iyer Heritage Page
Hi:
I invite you to take a look at the Iyer Heritage Page at
http://home.earthlink.net/~ravi/iyer.html
This is just the beginning of an effort to collect and disseminate social,
cultural, historical, genetic and economic information about Iyers in
particular and Smarta brahmins in general.
All criticism, comments & suggestions are welcome.
Regards

Subhaashitam: (Ancient Sanskrit Couplet)
||Kshamaa balam a-shaktaanaam; shaktaanaam bhUshaNam kshamaa|
  Kshamaa vashikrte loke, kshamayA: kim na sidhyati ? | ||
Subhashitasya anuvaadam (Translation):
Forgiveness is the strength of the weak.
Forgiveness embellishes the mighty.
In a world that can be conquered by forgiveness,
what is not possible by forgiveness?
