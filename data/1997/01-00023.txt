Q: Saskia Kersenboom
Coincidentally, I have been reading the same book
for the past week and find it to be very fascinating.
I remember that Prof.Kamil Zvelebil had talked about
this work as forthcoming in his "Companion studies to
the history of Tamil literature" (Leiden, 1992).
However, the problem is that although I have access 
to a Philips CD-I player, I cannot see certain sections
of the disk that need full motion video... the CD-I
player that I have access to is a very early model, 
it seems.
