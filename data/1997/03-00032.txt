One aspect of the question about the two terms 'Indo-Germanic' and
'Indo-European' that imho deserves to be noticed is that 'Indo-Germanic'
seems to have ethnic connotations: "The languages of Indians, Germanians
(?) and those in between", while 'Indo-European' seems to have geographical
connotations: "the languages spoken from India to Europe. I think the term
'Indo-European' is preferable chiefly for that reason -- i.e. it don't mix
linguistic notions with any "biological" ones, however vague. It should be
noted that the term was coined and adopted before Tokharian was discovered.

Sarvam mangalam!
