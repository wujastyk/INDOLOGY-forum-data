Jains and violence
The bibliography in the catalogue on Jain art entitled 'The peaceful 
liberators : Jaina art from India' (edited by Pratapaditya Pal, Los Angeles 
etc., 1995) contains many useful references to more recent literature (both 
monographs and articles) on Jaina art, religious views, mythology, 
cosmography, pilgrimage etc.
