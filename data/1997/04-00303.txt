Re Manava Dharma Sastra, original devanagari
Dear friends,
I have two different copies in English and one in Spanish (translated
from German) of the Manu Code but I would like to get a copy of an
original Samskrit text. Could you send me a bookstore or publisher
address where I can order from?
Thanks a lot,
Fernando
