Subject: Graha epithets
Message-ID: <161227034173.23782.1979965629180461189.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

There are two epithets, one of Shani and one of
Ketu, that I don't understand.  Can anyone help
with the meaning of these:

For Shani, Niilaa~njanagiriprakhya, which to
mean something like the One who has the appearance
of a <giri> of blue ointment.  What does giri
mean in this context?

For Ketu, Taarakaagrahataaraka where it seems to
be Taarakaa - wife of Brhaspati, graha - seizing,
taaraka - planet.  Was Ketu somehow involved in the
abduction of the wife of Brhaspati that resulted in
the birth of Budha by Candra?

Thank you for any help you can provide.
