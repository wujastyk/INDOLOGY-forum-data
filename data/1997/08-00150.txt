 The Department of South and Southeast Studies of the University of
California at Berkeley invites applications for a full-time, tenure or
tenure-track position in Sanskrit Language and Literature to be effective
July 1, 1998. The rank of the appointment is open and will depend on the
qualifications of the successful applicant. Applicants must possess the
Ph.D. in some area of Sanskrit Language and Literature. Familiarity with
spoken Sanskrit will be an advantage. Knowledge of one or more Middle Indic
languages is required and familiarity with at least one New Indic
(Indo-Aryan or Dravidian) language is highly desirable. Training in
historical and comparative Linguistics and a good grounding in VyAkaraNa is
essential. Research specialization is open, but the successful candidate
will be expected to have demonstrated competence in at least one area from
among the three central fields of traditional Sanskrit learning: Vyakarana,
Sahitya and Darshana. It is expected that the successful applicant will be
able to demonstrate scholarly familiarity with various genres and forms of
the language. Applicants must additionally demonstrate significant
engagement with the theoretical and methodological concerns of contemporary
literary, social, historical and cultural scholarship on South Asia and
should be aware of contemporary developments in language pedagogy. Such
demonstration will be in the form of a corpus of completed research writing
appropriate to the stage in his or her career. Teaching responsibilities
will include advanced courses in Sanskrit and Middle Indic languages and
literatures, upper division and graduate lectures and seminars in Indian
literature and civilization as well as undergraduate and graduate courses
on the cultures, religions, literatures and civilizations of traditional
and contemporary South Asia.

Applicants' letters should describe their current and projected research
and teaching interests and should be accompanied by copies of relevant
publications, vita, the names and addresses of three referees, and, where
