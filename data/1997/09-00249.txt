                 LAHORE 1947- EXPERIENCE OF PARTITION
Lahore, the gateway to the Indian sub-continent, had through the centuries
attracted trade caravans, plundering hordes and conquerors in search of 
wealth and power. A city ruled by Hindu kings, Mughal emperors and Sikh 
monarchs finally came under the British rule in 1849. British Raj brought 
in its wake an era of unprecedented peace and prosperity. 
The city acquired the reputation of the Paris of the East. People of 
different communities lived in perfect harmony. The interplay of 
historical forces had made the Muslims of Punjab less fanatic and the 
Hindus and Sikhs less orthodox and ritual conscious than elsewhere in 
India. Three communities subscribed to a composite Punjabi culture. In 
the words of Dr.Prem Kirpal, a leading educationist:

                       Old Lahore was gay and youthful,
                            moving easily with times,
                        earning well and spending more, 
                       receiving joy and shunning gloom 
                                       ?
                         Warm-hearted and vital people 
                         of diverse faiths and traditions, 
                           united in confident resolve 
                        to enjoy life and reach its peaks.
