Just check  for instance under "Rauravagama" and "Ajitagama" (I dont know 
exactly which one contains the illustrations). - They are published in a 
series (formerly) called PUBLICATION DE L INSTITUT FRANCAIS DE 
PONDICHERRY (the name has now slightly changed - but all the Agamas are 
still under that name.) - You could also ask for a catalogue of the 
publications of the INDOLOGY Dept. Write to:
