Question on bhRgus
In the Buddhist texts, the term "bhaggava" is used to denote "potters".
Pali-English Dictionary gives the Sanskrit equivalent as "bhArgava" derived
from "bhRgu". Apparently, the Sanskrit form in this meaning occurs in MBh.
1.190.47; Saddhp. 191 sq.,  and MVastu III.347. Obviously the MBh reference
is not from the critical edition. Are there other references where bhArgavas
are linked to potters? Thanks in advance.
