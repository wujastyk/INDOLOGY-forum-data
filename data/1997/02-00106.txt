Correction to Brhadratha etc. about Aryan kings who learnt Tamil
Let me correct an error in my earlier posting.
Actually, there were two names of Aryan kings mentioned in the Classical
Tamil literature as either a student or poet of Tamil. (Some think that both
may refer to a single person.)   
1. Aariyavaracan Pirakattan  (Brhadratha?)
2. Aariyavaracan Yal Piramatattan  (Brahmadatta well-versed in lute?  or
                        Brahmadatta of Gandhara?)
The first one is mentioned in the colophon as a student of Tamil
Culture/language for whose benefit KuRincippaaTTu was composed by Kapilar.
The second one is mentioned in the colophon as the author of a poem in
Kuruntokai.
As I mentioned earlier, I would appreciate any information about these two
from the Sanskrit/Pali/Prakrit.
