I don't think so. "To honey" is not "to utter honey" but "to call somebody
honey". It is transitive and therefore can't possibly stand for "to utter
honey" which is an inherently intransitive expression.
But maybe I don't understand what you're saying.
I'm not sure Dominik's point is correct. (Incidentally I thought it was just
a humorous aside) There's is no infinite recursion in this particular case
because in the "don't X me" construction X has to be a term of address
(considered offensive, belittling, etc.) X does not stand for any utterance
and to X someone stands for to call someone X, it does not stand for to utter
X (which would be intransitive)
