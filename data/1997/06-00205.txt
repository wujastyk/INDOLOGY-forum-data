Accent and Meaning
R.N. Dandekar's Vedic Bib. Vol. 1, page 84, lists an article by C. K. Raja
at the V All-India Oriental Conf. in Lahore, 1928: "The Relation of Accent
and Meaning in the Rig Veda."  I have those volumes, but the only article
therein by Raja concerns the relation of commentaries on the RV and Niruka
(e.g. saayaNa, maadhava, etc.).  Important material, of course, but not
absolutely germane to the topic on which I am focused.  If anyone knows
the wherabouts of this study--or similar studies--I would be most
appreciative.

It is ludicrous to consider language as anything other 
than that of which it is the transformation.
