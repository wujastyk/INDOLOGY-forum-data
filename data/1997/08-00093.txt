Q: Black Draupadi?

	Very clear: seeing the text, I was wrong. But are we sure this
passage is not an etymological play to explain his name ? There are many
other examples of such plays (BhISma, DroNa, KRpa, &c.) in the MBh.
	This is an old debat: is the MBh historical or mythical ? The same
thing arise in Greece with the Trojan War.
	I'm working about the links between the two epics and I believe
they are very near, hence mythical ones. For example, briefly:
Draupadi had five husbands, Helen had five husbands: the pious and just
Theseus, the brutal windrunner Achilleus, the loudvoiced Menelaus and the
two brothers Paris and Deiphobos (born in an other nation as the twins are
born from Madri, an other mother).
Draupadi had an ayonisambhava, Helen is born from an egg.
Draupadi is an incarnation of Sri, Helen is the gift of Aphrodite, both
Goddesses born in the Ocean, churned or foamy, from a lotus or a shell.
Draupadi and Helen married in a svayamvara, the first a son of Indra, the
second a direct descendant of Zeus, both Thunder's Gods.
Drupada made for revenge the sacrifice where Draubadi was born, in a
parallel version Helen is not the daughter of Leda but of Nemesis,
revenge's Goddess.
	Hence I suppose nor Draupadi, nor Helen, beeing historical or
ethnical characters, but that's just my opinion.
