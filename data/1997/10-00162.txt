Dear netters!

A Norwegian TV journalist is planning a series of programs from South Asia.
He is looking for good stories. These should concern individuals who have
done outstanding things ("success stories"), and the stories should have a
humanitarian touch. Nor necessarily Mother Teresas, but people who have made
significant contributions to their communities. Does anybody have some good
suggestions?

Best regards,

Lars Martin Fosse
