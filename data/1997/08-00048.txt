A student of mine is doing a research project on the role (fi any) of faith
in Hinduism, both (or either) classical and contemporary. I really can't
think of any sources that discuss this topic, but if anyone else can, I'd
greatly appreciate it if you could share them. I'll pass them on to my
student.
