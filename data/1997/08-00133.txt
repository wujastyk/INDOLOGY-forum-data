	Both meanings 'spy' and 'astrology' come naturally from a general

verb tEreO 'to observe' (root *kvEr-) and not with carati 'to walk' (root
*kvel-).
	About using both spies and astrologers, I suppose a wise king use
all the ways to have knowledge of the ennemy, because even if you trust the
astrology, astrologers are men and can make mistakes.
