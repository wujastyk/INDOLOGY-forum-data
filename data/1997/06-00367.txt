filters
	I inform some of you that new mailing handlers (as example Eudora
Light 3.0.21) have filters you can use to send automatically to the trash,
mailings coming from certain persons.
	Hoping to help,
Dominique
PS: for someone who use many pseudonyms, you must make an entry for each
new one (or use as criterium a http address present in the text).
