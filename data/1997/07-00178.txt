 I don't think you'll find a Gupta period text on the stated subject.  But
probably no one has inferred more about what such texts are likely to have
said from careful analysis of the physical images themselves than John
Mosteller:

 Mosteller, John F. _ The measure of form : a new approach for the study of
Indian sculpture_ New Delhi : Abhinav Publications, 1991. Description:
xxx, 291 p., [119] p. of plates : ill., map ; 28 cm.
 Notes:  Originally presented as the author's thesis (Ph.
                 D.--University of Pennsylavania, 1986).
              Includes indexes.
