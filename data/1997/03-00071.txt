Korean/Tamil/Hindi (was Re: Query on var.nabheda)
Lay person's question:
I read while doing some research (on an entirely different subject that I
won't go into at this time) at the NYPL's Oriental Division that Mundari,
the central Indian aboroginal/aadivaasi laguage has some connections with
Magyar and Korean, and that Magyar and Korean are related in some ways. Is
there any truth in this?
Just curious.
