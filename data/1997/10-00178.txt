ADvice
I suggest that subscribers use other forums for "finding" people and
request the moderator to not permit these messages not related to indology...
Anyway..There are numerous people who have given their lives for helping
others. I would say the world is getting to be a really sorry place
if the only qualification for Ms. Vaid to be considered a humanitarian is that
she is gay ???????
