We really do not know the type of loom that forms the basis of the
metaphor. It appears that the weaver was located not behind the warp (as in
modern hand-looms) but on the side where she (and it is mostly women!) can
pass the shuttle back and forth. I have seen one reference that speaks of a
pair of women weaving (can't think of the source); if so there may have
been two women on either side of the loom passing the shuttle back and
forth
