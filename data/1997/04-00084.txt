Rig Veda, ta'ntra, nUl, and sUtra
We really do not know the type of loom that forms the basis of the
metaphor. It appears that the weaver was located not behind the warp (as in
modern hand-looms) but on the side where she (and it is mostly women!) can
pass the shuttle back and forth. I have seen one reference that speaks of a
pair of women weaving (can't think of the source); if so there may have
been two women on either side of the loom passing the shuttle back and
forth
