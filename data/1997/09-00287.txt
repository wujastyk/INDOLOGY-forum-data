For the etymology of NepAlI "dudela" :

cf. R.L. Turner, A Comparative and Etymological Dictionary of the Nepali
Language, p.314 :
dudhe / dude (< sk. dugdha) pertaining to milk.
The word appears in the name of various plants, (having in common a white
milky sap, I suppose)
dudelo (/ dudeulo / dudheulo) laharA : ficus faveolata
dudhilo / dudilo "A particular kind of small tree with a white juice, Ficus
memoralis.

Acoording to the nepAlInighaNTu,  the word "dudhe" (milky) is prefixed to
the name of various plants in NepalI (latin names as given by the compilers) :
dudhe jhAra (154-156) Oxystelma esculentum;  Euphorbia thymifolia;
Holosterma rheedianum.
dudhe maruI laharo (27) : Clematis triloba
dudhe bara (560) : ?
dudhe birAle laharo (303) : Pueraria tuberosa
dudhe laharo (29) : Campylus glaucus

According to the same, and probably by analogy of their milky sap with
sperm, most of them are supposed to have the property of increasing
virility or of curing women's sterility.

As to brumbrumdakari, I suppose that it might spell X-kArI (= kArin) i.e.
having the sound X (kAra "ifc. terme qui d?signe une lettre, un son, un mot
ind?clinable"). Sk. udaka seems (to me) quite unlikely

Hope this helps,
J.F.
