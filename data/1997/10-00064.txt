        From *ag- 'to lead, sacrify, burn': *ag-n- 'fire', locative in
Agnideva 'the God in the fire' > 'the fire'. With a nasal infix with
causative sense *ang- 'to make a fire, a sacrifice', with agent suffix
*-h1-l- : *angir- 'sacrificer'. The masculine sigmatic thema is an
intensive abstraction: 'THE sacrificer'.
        We don't know the first rapports between Aryans and Dravidians. To
suppose one of them better than other is just a fiction intending to attise
the hate between today's people. In fact, both contribute to give birth to
India. Compare the best known rapports between Greece and Roma: who was the
winner ?
