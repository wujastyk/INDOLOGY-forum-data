Spamming
Our list has not been bothered with spamming for some time (as far as I can
see), but if this spectre should once again lift its ugly head, here is a
counter-strategy that might inspire us all. It is from the corpora list:

Dear Eugene, [who suggested moderation as a way to counter spamming]
Perhaps moderation is one way to go. I have no firm opinion on this. What 
I do is to thank them for their interest in the corpora list by donating 
a 4 million word corpus (encrypted of course) included in my reply to 
them. Usually they use a fake return address so I just keep the domain 
part and replace the receiver part with "postmaster". I include the 
original junk so that the postmaster can figure out what inspired my 
response.
Probably not a real good idea, but since I'm on vacation I haven't had 
the energy to figure out anything more constructive.
