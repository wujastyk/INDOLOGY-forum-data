Atharva Veda info request
        For Shaunakiiya Atharvaveda, a few years ago (1980) there were two
reciters in Varanasi, Narayan Shastri Ratate and one more whose name
escapes me.  I visited Pt. Ratate and got hold of a manuscript of the
Shaunakiiya Caturaddhyayikaa.  Mr. Ratate is now gone, but I hear that his
son is continuing the tradition.
        I am currently editing three manuscripts, two of the Jatapatha and
one of Kramapatha for the Shaunakiiya AV, and as far as I know there is no
one alive who can recite these VikRtipathas.
        All the best,
                                Madhav Deshpande
