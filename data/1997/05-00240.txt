The National Union Catalog, pre 56 lists nearly 2 dozen publications
associated with Mr. Leitner.  The British Library catalog lists over a
dozen.  One book was published in 1889 by the Oriental Nobility Institute
in Woking and another in 1896 from the Oriental University Institute,
Woking. He also edited a journal al-Haqaiq=Arabic quarterly review from
Woking and 2 #'s of the Punjab Education Magazine from Lahore.
