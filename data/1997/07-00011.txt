You're right, of course.  Umm.  I'm not sure how to express this any
better in English.  "Big predator v. ordinary animal?"  There *is* a
sensible difference between, say, a lion and a cat.  Is is just a matter
of the danger level?  We talk about "Big cats" meaning much more than
"large moggies".  There must be a way of capturing the Sanskrit
distinction in idiomatic (not my idiotic) English. :-)
