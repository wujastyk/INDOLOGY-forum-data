Having been met with the attitude "he can't be a serious scholar, because

only say that a lot of housecleaning needs to be done, in western thinking
in general, and not only in certain countries and within certain scholarly
diciplines, because our mindset is still: either you colonialize or you're
colonialized.
May there be happiness to all of you, and indeed to all beings!

"Peace is not simply the absence of war.
It is not a passive state of being.
We must wage peace, as vigilantly as we wage war."
(His Holiness the XIV Dalai Lama)
