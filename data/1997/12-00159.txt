This is a common phenomena for complex fonts,.becasue they require
substantially larger type size to look good.
When your word processor is set to automatic spacing, even though the
character appears to be "normal" size on the screen, it is actually larger
as seen by the word processor, so it sets the spacing accordingly. If you go
into the line spacing and set it for a particular number of points instead
of "single," then the problem goes away.
