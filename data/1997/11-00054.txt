m/anusvAra & s/visarga
May I make an adjustment to Dominique Thillaud's statement of the
distribution of Visarga and h in Sanskrit? It is a very simple
complementary distribution: h before a voiced sound (i.e. vowel or a
voiced consonants), visarga before a voiceless sound or silence (avasAne,
i.e. at the end of a sentence or at any other point where the sandhi is
broken). It is therefore quite possible to use the same character for both
without ambiguity; but if you want a computer to transcribe it into
Devanagari or standard romanization, you will have to tell the computer
which consonants are voiced and which are voiceless.
