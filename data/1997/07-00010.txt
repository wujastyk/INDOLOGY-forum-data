How a buck/stag could have become a lion!
 Following Domink who just wrote:
I've been waiting to join this thread until a relevant article I wrote on
the subject is posted on the Web...By coincidence it's the first e-text I
hope to convert to HTML for a new undergraduate humanities course starting
late August, (_Asia at Internet_)  The article:  _Victorious Durga , The
Buffalo Slayer,_ in  _MUSE: Annual of the Museum of Art and Archaeology,_
20 (1986), University of Missouri-Columbia [1988]:  50-65.
Anyhow--while the color plates from Singavaram, Tiruchirapalli and
Mamallapuram, etc., can wait, I should say now that the lion and deer
vahanas exemplify two separate traditions--the lion traceable back
ultimately to Ishtar in Mesopotamia (not to the exclusion of contemporary
IVC imagery, of course--but the comparable deities remain unnamed so long
as the Harappan script is undeciphered).
Visual proof that two vahanas were understood as discrete alternatives
appears in the Pallava cave-sites enumerated above--where BOTH animals
attend Durga [for what its worth--the lion favored on the proper right;
deer to her left]
