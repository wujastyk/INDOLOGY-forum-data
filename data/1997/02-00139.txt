	Here is the explanation of the svara marks in the Yajur Veda. There
	are three svaras used in the Yajur Veda ( I vaguely remember the names
	to be anudatta, udatta and svarita). The udatta is the standard 
	pitch and has no markings. 

The accentless syllables, pracaya, are also recited the
same as udAtta... i.e. at a middle pitch.

	The anudatta, denoted by an underline, is the lower pitch 

Where there are successive anudAttas, one can hear the
sarvAnudAtta...recited at a pitch lower than anudAtta.

	all the sandhi rules myself. The dirga svarita or two vertical lines
	on top of the syllable is formed as a result of such a sandhi. The 
	syllable with such a mark is supposed to be chanted for two units of
	time ( a syllable takes one unit of time ), the first unit in the 
	standard pitch and the second unit of time in the upper pitch.

	Hope this helps. Listening to an audio tape of any Yajur Vedic chant
	will make it abundantly clear. Especially, if one analyses the
	form of chanting called krama pATa.m and Ga.na pATa.m. If a line of
	the samhita text contains 5 words (say) :

	1 2 3 4 5

	krama pATa.m consists of chanting it as :

	1 2 2 1 1 2
	2 3 3 2 2 3
	3 4 4 3 3 4
	4 5 5 4 4 5

This is the jaTApATha vikrti, not krama.
