The red colour mentioned in connection with Indra could also be due to the
fact that red is the colour of the second estate (or varna). White should be
the colour that belongs to the brahmins and black the colour that belongs to
the vish. 
There is a similar problem with Greek colours. The only way to know, is when
colour terms are referred to natural phenomena that haven't changed since
ancient times. E.g. white may be referred to the egg of a hen, red to a
given kind of red berries, brown to soil etc.
