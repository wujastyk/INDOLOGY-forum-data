How about Konrad Koerner:
"Observations on the sources, transmission and meaning of
'Indo-European' and related terms in the development of linguistics."
In: Papers from the 3rd International Conference on Historical
Linguistics / Ed. by J. Peter Maher [et al.]. Amsterdam: Benjamins,
1982, p. 153-180 (there seems to be an article in Indogermanische
Forschungen 86 (1981[1982]), p. 1-29 which is of similar contents or
simply the same).
