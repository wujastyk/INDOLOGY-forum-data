I respect all Gods (except perhaps the angry and jealous Yahve and the
other Lords of War and Punishment) because they are linked to the best of
human life. I do domestic sacrifices to Ganesha, Sarasvati, Hermes,
Aphrodite, Athena and Dionysos because I'm in feeling with their 'sense'. I
believe they are helping me, but I have no trust in their existence.
	Perhaps I'm a sort of fool ?
