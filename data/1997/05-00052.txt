hair's colour in Sanskrit
Despite the emphasis on the beauty of fair skin in India today...isn't 
there an old story that ancient Indians heard tales from travelers of 
white-skinned, blue-eyed people and laughingly denied such tales, saying 
the gods could not be so cruel as to make such people?

beautifully dark-skinned Indian)
