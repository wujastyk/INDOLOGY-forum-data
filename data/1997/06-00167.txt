	Some nationalistic trouble ?
	What do you mean about:
hyperonym: German
hyponyms: allemand, tedesco, deutsch, English, Britannic, French, graecus
colonial: America, Australia, New Zealand
	&c., &c.
	Are you really sure that Bharat is better than India for *all*
Indian peoples ? Are you sure that xenophoby is the best way to go in the
world ?
	Nationalistic etymologies are very easy, for example (I'm French):
	cash < lat. capsa (fr. cha^sse, it. cassa) via the 'normand' french
dialect where the 'ka' is not palatalized.
	Better for the glorious France, isn't it ?
	Incidentally, India is not strictly a *foreign* word: the ancient
greek words 'India', 'indikos' come probably from sindhu or apparented
forms.
