In the MBh women are untrustworthy ONLY as "absolute" women, with no relationship to 
men. As mothers, faithful wives and widows, and obedient daughters they are not, they

Difference between Svadhrma and Stridharma and the Strisvabhava" [diacr. omitted here]

Perugia*, Vol. XXVIII, nuova serie XIV, Sezione Studi Classici, Perugia 1990, pp.

Enrica

p.s. BTW instead of "Cosi' fan tutte" translate with "La donna e' mobile"
