One intriguing question: what is a supposedly consonantal
script, which should have enough with about 40 signs, doing
with hundreds of signs? Doesn't this look like overkill?
And what's this business of having related Brahmi to that
script? Can those guys really derive the shapes of Brahmi
letters from the script, in a way that anyone else but
them, and especially competent epigraphists, could also
feel happy about?
