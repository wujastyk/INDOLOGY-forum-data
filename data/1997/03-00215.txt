Dear Mister Tattvarthi!

I don't know whether that particular Adhyatma-Ramayana is available on the
net but I would like to recommend you to visit the homepage of our Institute
for Indology and Tamil Studies (IITS) at Cologne University, Germany.
There are many links to various E-text-files which you'll enjoy to surf.
Yours,
Tobias
