Indian computing?
Re Is there a reference book for computing & Indian languages
There is: "Natural Language Processing - A Paninian Perspective"
by Akshar Bharati, Vineet Chaitanya and Rajeev Sangal,
Prentice Hall of India, New-Delhi, 1995.
It is about computational linguistics, inspired by Pananian notions to deal
with indian languages. This is work pursued at IIT Kanpur.
