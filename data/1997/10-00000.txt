A few questions - kavirAjamArga
Sheldon Pollock, Prof. of Skt. at the University of Chicago, is presently
preparing a translation of the kavirAjamArga. In fact, I believe he is
virtually done with it. So you should contact him about it. I do not
believe he frequents listservs, so he is probably not aware of your
questions.
