A meter in the Bhagavata Purana
A collegue who is not on any online discussion list has asked if I can post
up the following for him. His dissertation is due soon and a little last
minute help will be greatly appreciated. Thanks.
Svicchaabhih.

This pattern appears prominently in the 31st chapter of the tenth book of the
Bhagavata, verses 1 through 18.  Is this metrical pattern an  unidentified
pattern, or is there a source for identifying this specific pattern in this
important chapter of the Bhagavata, and if so, what is the source and what is
this pattern called?
