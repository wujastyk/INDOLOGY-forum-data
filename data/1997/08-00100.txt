I agree. We therefore need to encourage scholars in other fields to bring
their own studies of religion, world views, theories of modernity and
pre-modernity, social organization and social control, and so on, into
dialogue with Hindu Studies. We equally need to encourage South Asia
scholars to explore such perspectives in their own work. To consider
Hinduism comparatively as a 'form of life' as clarified by its contrasts
and similarities to other historical and present day forms would make it
more interesting to non-Indologists and more relevant to contemporary
thought.
