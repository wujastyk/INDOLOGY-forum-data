Subject: INDOLOGY archives updated to Jan 97
Message-ID: <161227028325.23782.11520172056040044546.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Alan Thew, who manages the INDOLOGY software in Liverpool, has just
updated the browsable archives to include January 1997.  

To browse past issues of INDOLOGY, point your web browser at 
  http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgadkw/indology.html
and choose "INDOLOGY's own Gopher".  Or, if you have a gopher client,
point it at 
  gopher.liv.ac.uk/11/lists/indology

Thanks, Alan!

All the best,
Dominik

Not available yet. Yes it's something we want too. but we need a machine
reconfig, a 4GB is waiting just for this purpose. I have updated the
browsable archives to include Jan 97.
