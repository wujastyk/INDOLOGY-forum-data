A question about Sri Aurobindo Ghosh
Volume 18, titled "On Himself," of the Centenary (1972) 
Edition of Sri Aurobindo's collected works would be a 
good place to start.  Also see "Sri Aurobindo or the 
Adventure of Consciousness" by Satprem, and Kees Bolle's 
fascinating "The Persistence of Religion; an Essay on  
Tantrism and Sri Aurobindo's Philosophy."
