Middle Marvari word
The cpd cihnadhara occurs only one time in the MBh, at 6.19.26c, where
it is an adjective modifying mahaadhvaja.  Here is the zloka, quoted
from the Tokunaga e-text of the Poona text:
006.019.0261/.teSaam.aaditya.candra.aabhaah.kanaka.uttama.bhuuSaNaah./
006.019.0263/.naanaa.cihna.dharaa.raajan.ratheSv.aasan.mahaa.dhvajaah.//
The passage occurs in van Buitenen's Bhagavad Gita in the MBh, pp.
58-59, and he translated the zloka:  "There were tall standards on their
chariots . . . . adorned with the finest gold and bearing many emblems."
