Imperfection of Western Indology (pace Fosse)
The reason for the imperfection of Indology in the West is easy to
ascertain, viz:
INDOLOGY> In (negative prefix) + do (action), thus = inactive + log
(inactive piece of wood) >> Inactive as an inactive piece of wood. Without
action there is no progress, etc. ....    quod erat deomonstrandum
