avidya in Pali literature
In sutra II.5 of Patanjali's Yogasutra, avidya is defined as follows:
anityaashuciduHkhaanaatmasu nityashucisukhaatmakhyaatiravidyaa |
"Avidya is the taking of the non-eternal, the impure, the painful and the 
non-self to be the eternal, the pure, the pleasurable and the self."
I'm almost certain that there exists, somewhere in early Buddhist (Pali) 
literature, a passage on avidya which uses very-similar wording. However, 
I can't seem to locate it at present. Can anyone out there help?
