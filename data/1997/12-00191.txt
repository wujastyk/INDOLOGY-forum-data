Was someone asking about the Garudopanisad a few weeks ago?  I can't
find any such searching on the archive, but seem to recall an exchange on
it.  Anyhow, if anyone was, an ed. by Albrecht Weber can be found in his
Indische Studien, 17, p. 161-167.  It was among the offprints I was sorting
out.  Also, I can provide a photocopy easily.  Please contact me directly not
on the list.
