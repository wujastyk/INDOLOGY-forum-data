How to subscribe to TAMIL-L
Dear Networkers,
I would very much like to subscribe to the TAMIL-L electronic conference, if
it is still in existence, but all my attempts to contact the
<listserv at vm.urz.uni-heidelberg.de> have so far failed. Is the listserv no
longer active or is there a queue of those wishing to join so long that it
takes more than 5 days to get through?
Gratefully Yours, Jan Filipsky 
<listserv at vm.urz.uni-heidelberg.de>... Deferred: Connection timed out during
initial connection with lsv.urz.uni-heidelberg.de.
