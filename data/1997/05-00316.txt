experiences with d.k.agencies (question)
I have ordered Urdu and Hindi books from them often and have found their
service excellent.  Their catalogues are also many cuts above what most
booksellers offer.  I've found it well worthwhile being on their mailing
list; I end up using them more than most other sources.
