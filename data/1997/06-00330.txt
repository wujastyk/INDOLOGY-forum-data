I feel commentaries on kavyas are often an interesting piece of work by
itself. But I know of not only no renderings of their contents into a
modern language (except the example of Roodbergen's thesis mentioned
above) but not even of some thorough studies of kavya-commentaries. They
are interestin both for the comments given as also for their language
peculiarities. 
    If you know of works dealing with kavya comms. please let me know.
