I am trying to gather information on Jain versions of the Mahabharata. I am
looking for versions of the story (is there a Jain text that enjoys, in the
Mahabharata domain, a status equal to that of the Paumacarita in the
Ramayana tradition?) as well as secondary literature.
Also, where is the theory about the sets of Baladevas, Vasudevas and
prativasudevas (of which the last set--Balarama, Krishna and Jarasandha--
form the heroes of Jain Mahabharatas) first textualized?
I will greatly appreciate any help or reference.
