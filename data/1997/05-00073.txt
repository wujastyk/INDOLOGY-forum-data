A young Bengali woman in Germany informed me that in the Bengali language there
are four words (which I do not recall now; can any Bengalis help?) for shades
of skin colouring. She belonged to the darkest category, and so her fair
parents in Calcutta decided not to save money for a dowry but to send her to
college instead, since she would have to support herself later on in life. (She
later married a German and showed off her pale-faced husband to her Calcutta
friends who were supposedly so fair and beautiful!)
