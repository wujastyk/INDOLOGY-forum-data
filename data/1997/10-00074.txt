VBAmodul Devanagari ATTENTION!
Hi boys (not one lady asked for the modul! the only message from a lady did
not concern the modul but my note NO MACINTOSH - is it not lovely?)
there is one bug: open the modul. two lines are For i = 0 To 151. Please
change 151 into 152 otherwise your d will not be changed correct into
devanagari.
The modul works only with that version of WINWORD that is available since
OFFICE97 is on the marked that came 1997 on the market. You can use the modul
also for earlier Winword versions (which for instant do not understand the &
meaning +) but this needs some changes in the modul. it is very easy. Give me
a note I will do it for you.
