"Protestant"
Hi Noel,
This may not help, but the only thing that comes to mind immediately (and
this is under the influence of Bacardi, Beaulieu Vinyardss, and Wild
Turkey), is that  Agehananda Bharati had something to say about this in
LIGHT ON.... and TANTRIC TRADITION.  Possibly OCHRE ROBE.  Perhaps in an
introduction.  Something to do with most of the itinerany Hindu speakers,
especially those that come Westward preach nothing but Protestant Christian
doctrine.
Hey.  How are you?  Great to hear from you.

"What country can preserve its liberties if their rulers are not
warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of
resistance?....The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time
with the blood of patriots & tyrants. It is its natural manure."
