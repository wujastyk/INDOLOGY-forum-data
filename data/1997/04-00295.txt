Not surprising, but the emperor has effectively eclipsed the saint as
"owner" of the name.

I read once that while Sikh males always have typical Sikh names, that is
not always so with women, since "Hindu" (VERY big scare-quotes!!) girls'
names are perceived as more "feminine". Is anyone of you able to
confirm/refute this? It's interesting because many European languages also
seem to be more open to foreign female names than to foreign male names.
