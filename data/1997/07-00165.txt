Tagore/Germany
Dear listmembers,
a friend of our institute from India is looking for personal data of some 
people who worked with Rabindranath Tagore while he was visiting Germany 
in 1920 and 1930. These people are Helene Meyer- Frank, Marie-Loise 
Gothein, Hedwig Lachman, Gisela Leister and Annemarie von Putkammer.
Can anybody help?
