a request for information and sources on theory (ies) of              perception, causation and explaination
Dear Friends
I will be grateful for some help in understanding various theories
explainaing the concept of perception,
causality and explaination in Indian and Other Traditions in comparative
sense.
In Sankhya I remember having read about several attributes of  a phenomenon
for exlaining its essence such as Guna, Karma , Prakar, swabhav etc.,
Pl forgive my ingorance. Is Sankhya Yoga available on inetrnet sites? What
else shoudl one read on thsi subject.
Thanks
