Dear Kristen,
At the "Museum f?r V?lkerkunde",Vienna (Austria), there is an exhibition with
the title "DIE OLEOGRAPHIERTEN G?TTER, Moderne Druckgraphik in Indien 1890 -
1970." This exhibition demonstrates the influence of modern printing
techniques on the production of devotional pictures in India and also their
close connection with commercial advertisements and political propaganda.
Unfortunately, no catalogue is available (only a very small folder).
You can find some information on

Maybe you should try and contact (with the help of the museum?) Erwin
Neumayer and/or Christine Schelberger, who prepared the exhibition.
Good luck!
