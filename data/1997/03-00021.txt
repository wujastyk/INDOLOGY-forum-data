In Olender's _The Languages of Paradise_ (1992; originally publ. in Fr.,
1989), he has a footnote (47, on page 11), which credits the first use of
"Indo-European" to an anonymous (attributed by Hans Siegert to T. Young) 
review of Adelung's _Mithridates, oder Allgemeine Sprachenkunde_ in _The
Quarterly Review_ 10 (Oct. 1813-Jan. 1814). Note also, footnotes 45 and 46
on the first uses (in Europe) of "Aryan" (attributed to Anquetil-Duperron)
and "Indo-Germanic" (generally attributed to J. von Klaproth (ca. 1823),
but Olender cites a usage in 1810 by C. Malte-Brun).
