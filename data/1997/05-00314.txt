Science and beliefs (was: the gods)
Exactly. Agree with all you say. Hawking has tried to supply an eschatology
as well, but hasn't been totally successful.
Still it is the translators duty, irrespective of his own tenets, to convey
the pragmatics *of the author*. This means that the translator must be
familiar with the subject matter and with the cultural context, including
the beliefs and values of the author -- the more the better --, but it
doesn't mean that the translator *has to share* the culture, beliefs or
values of the author. Indeed it is not always possible: I may be a
co-religionist of Asanga's (for example), but the religion has evolved
since then, so _my_ Buddhism isn't exactly the same as his, nor is it
possible for me to actually partake of the reality in which he lived and
wrote.
AFAIK it is permissible to translate the Qur'an, but a translation is not
authoritative in the sense that the Arabic original is -- I'm sure there
are otheras on this list who can give more certain and accurate answers,
though.
