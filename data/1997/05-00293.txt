Does this mean that you consider it of no consequence what "personal
religious orientations" a scholar holds? Far from finding it desirable to
conceal my own religious orientation I think it is important that it is
known, since it is in any case likely to influence my thinking in all walks
of life, including scholarly work and scholarly orientation. I have
experienced that my "scholarly seriousness" was called into question
because of my Buddhist beliefs -- by an ordained Swedish Lutheran minister
acting as a university teacher. The idea that empathy or embracing of the
beliefs and values of the 'foreign' cultur one studies would be somehow
'contaminating' for a western scholar or student is IMO outright racist and
colonialist, and to those who object to my being openly Buddhist I have
only one comment: "Honi soit qui mal y pense"!
