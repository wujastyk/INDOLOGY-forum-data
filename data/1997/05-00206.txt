That's right.

Well, yes, KRta comes first and TretA comes second, but the names don't
refer to their order, they refer to their "value:" from best (4) to worst
(1); from whole to incomplete, from long to short, from dharmic to adharmic.

The colors are inverted, but not the order of the yugas.

The usual logic is precisely the 4-3-2-1 sequence, most likely derived from
the dice throws.
The 4-3-2-1 sequence was not always part of the system.  The Yuga PurANa,
which dates to around the early centuries BCE-CE, uses a decimal arrangement
for the length of life in each yuga, and to the astronomer AryabhaTTa the
four yugas were of equal length, divided into an ascending and a descending
half, like in the Jain cycles.  He still uses 432 000 000 for the four yuga
cycle, so each equal yuga contains 1 080 000 years.
