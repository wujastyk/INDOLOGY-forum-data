I think it would work like this:
 'If the previous character is not k, g, T, D, t, d, p, b and if the next
  character is k, kh, p, ph or space then visarga else h'
I checked a standard list of conjuncts (only an indication and not
necessarily a full proof, maybe) and the only ones starting with h are:
hNa, hna, hma, hya, hra, hla, hva, and furthermore h cannot appear
at the end of a word (except if that word is a stem used metalinguis-
tically, e.g. if someone writes _about_ a stem such as 'madhulih' for
example; but I won't worry about that since if it is clear that one's
talking about a stem, it's got to be h, no such thing as a stem in H).
Furthermore visarga inside a word can only appear before k, kh, p, ph.
In other words, as you were implying, h is h and H is H and never the
twain shall meet. Which means I can use h for both.
Unless of course, for some perverse reason, there was a word out there
with a hk, hkh, hp or hph sequence hiding inside!
Despite the absence of conjuncts one can always use virAma for evil
things like this, after all, if one really wants to, but let's not get
paranoid... I hope there isn't, right?
Otherwise, for visarga I should be all set. Thanks. Good suggestion.
