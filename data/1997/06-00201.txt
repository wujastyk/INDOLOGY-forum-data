"Hindu"
Dear list members,
It will be better for everybody's sanity if Jai Maharaj's postings are
simply ignored. This individual has certainly made various newsgroups very
colorful in the past, but this list certainly does not need the kind of
color he contributes. No response is the best response.

ps. I fully expect some sort of campaign on this list and/or newsgroups by
Jai Maharaj against me because of this post, but if such a thing happens,
I'm going to follow my own advice and ignore it all!
