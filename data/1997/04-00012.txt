Caitanya Caritamrta Madhya-lila 11.28, this verse is quoted by Krsnadasa
Kaviraja, and it is cited as from from "Adi Purana".
There is indeed an Adi purANa, which is however not a mahA purANa. There
is a brief description of this in "The Puranas" by Ludo Rocher, History
of Indian Literature. 
I don't know if this has ever been published at all. The info would
surely be available in the same book by Ludo Rocher. If you want me to
look up whether it has been published, please send me mail.
