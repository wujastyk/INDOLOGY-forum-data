Introduction to Dravidian Lingustics
Hello,

FYI it is, alas, still "Mr.", and probably going to be well into the
future, since it's hard to get the academic position necessary to get a
Ph.D. here in Sweden. The alternative is to be wealthy enough to be able to
do it without a position, and that won't probably happen before my kids are
grown up. Of course I manage well without a PhD anyway. Would like if jobs
for editors were more available and better paid, though...
Thanks for the info.
Regards

"Peace is not simply the absence of war.
It is not a passive state of being.
We must wage peace, as vigilantly as we wage war."
(XIV Dalai Lama)
"A coincidence, as we say in Middle-Earth"
