SUMMER LANGUAGE OFFERINGS AT MICHIGAN

The 1997 University of Michigan Summer Language Institute (SLI), a program
of the International Institute at U-M, offers intensive courses in three
South Asian languages:  Beg. and Int. Hindi, Beg. and Int. Tamil, and Beg.
Sanskrit; the availability of any class is contingent on sufficient
enrollment.  Each course provides the equivalent of a full  years language
instruction during the Universitys regular Summer Term (June 26-August 19)
and carries 8 hours of U-M credit. U-M language faculty teach the courses
and other faculty lecture on area studies topics.  Additional cultural
programs supplement the language courses.  For further information and
application materials, please call Marga Miller, Summer Language Institute
Coordinator, 313/764-8571 (fax: 313/763-4765, e-mail:
mkmiller at umich.edu).  THE APPLICATION DEADLINE IS APRIL 15.
