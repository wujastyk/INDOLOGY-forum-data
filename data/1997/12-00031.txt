John, I found another reference in this matter. If you look up Macdonell's
Vedic Grammar for Students (which I suppose you have) on page 172, you will
see a footnote referring to bo-dhi: "Formed from both bhuu be (for bhuu-dhi)
and budh awake (for bod-dhi instead of bud-dhi). Compare yo-dhi for yud-dhi
through yod-dhi.

I am sorry that I started dashing off my speculations. Witzel was right - we
shouldn't press the reply-button without thinking twice!
