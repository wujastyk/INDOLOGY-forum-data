	I'm not sure all this is in the scope of the list. Each time, you
provoke a meaningless debate.
	I'm sure the answers you'll have here will not be cited in your
book. Why ask you ?
	First I believed you was young and foolishly idealist, yet I
believe you are dangerous. Please, write your nationalistic book with
nationalistic sources, find a nationalistic editor, a nationalistic public
and I hope you obtain a lot of money to buy a Vimana Task Force and to kill
all barbarian foreigners in 'Bharat' with your Vajra Super Weapons: I'm not
very much afraid.
	And remember: after Yudhisthira was lying, his vimana touch the earth!
