	Dear Sudheer,

	Once again ?
	I suppose
	next months: vedic atomic bomb, vedic microsurgery, vedic big bang,
vedic telecommunication satellites, vedic AIDS treatment and so ...
	I'm not sure all this is in the scope of the list. Each time, you
provoke a meaningless debate.
	I'm sure the answers you'll have here will not be cited in your
book. Why ask you ?

	First I believed you was young and foolishly idealist, yet I
believe you are dangerous. Please, write your nationalistic book with
nationalistic sources, find a nationalistic editor, a nationalistic public
and I hope you obtain a lot of money to buy a Vimana Task Force and to kill
all barbarian foreigners in 'Bharat' with your Vajra Super Weapons: I'm not
very much afraid.

	And remember: after Yudhisthira was lying, his vimana touch the earth!
