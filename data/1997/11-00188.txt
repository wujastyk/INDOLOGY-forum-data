Subject: Problem with Norman Fonts
Message-ID: <161227033768.23782.17046885168975598253.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

The Norman font uses #160 for lowercase t with dot under. This is where
Windows expects the non-breaking space to be. AFAIK, there is no good
solution other than to switch to a different font encoding.
