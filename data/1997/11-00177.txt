        Despite the Indian equations rAjanya = kSatriya and indra =
devarAj, I believe the primitive 'king' was perhaps more a priest than a
warrior (or both). If I'm right, the role of the king in the fundation of a
town could be considered as delimiting and covering the space of the earth
(Roma ?) or, in hierogamy, as 'covering' the queen (Athens ?) ....
        Please, don't answer me I am wrong, that's just personal and
unprooved intuitions based on other researches.
