question
John Grimes asks,
I think you must mean *The Jew and The Lotus*
(or maybe The Lotus and The Jew?) -- I tried a search at Amazon.com 
just now, and (surprisingly) did not find it (under either form).
Have not read this, but have heard some discussion of it; I've the 
impression it was published in the U.S. perhaps 2-3 years ago(?);
the title of course involves (what is arguably typically American 
baby boomer generation) wordplay on the customary translation of the 
pervasive Tibetan mantram, Om mani padme hum (where "jewel" & "jew" 
are confounded) . . .
Sorry I don't recall the author's name.
d.i.
