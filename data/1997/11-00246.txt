I do not think Dr.Caldwell's certificate to Tamil is relevent here. Everyone
of Dravidian languages has its own protagonists and admirers. What all
I meant to say was Tamil is one of the languages in the Dravidian group of
languages. As some one on this list pointed out, perhaps  it has retained
some of the archaic forms than the other languages of the same group . That
does not give it the right to claim that it is identical with the
proto-dravidian out of which all the dravidian languages have evolved.
