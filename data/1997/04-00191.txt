Dear Shri VidyAshankar,
Thanks for your input on my article "abhi/abhIh".
Here is some information on 'abhinava shanakara' :
" abhinava-shankara:   According to the annals of Heads of 
the Sanctuary (Matha) in Kanchi-kamakoti, it seems that 
there were four  Shankaras after the Acharya Sri Shankara.
Among these, Sri KripA-shankara is the ninth. Sri Ujjwala-shnakara
is the fifteenth. Sri MUka-shanakara is the twnty-fifth.
The thirty-eigth Head is this Swamiji 'abhinava-shankara'.
He is the son of Sri Chidambara Vishvajit. 
As he traveled round the country several times like the
original preceptor (Acharya Shankara),  and vigorously propagated
the ideals of Advaita and rejuvinated it, he was nick-named as
'abhinava-shankara'. He has another nick-name 'dhIra-shankara'
because of his fierce debating character, a terror to his opponent
in debate (prativAdi-bhayanakara). According to a book
'shakarEndu-vilAsa' by Sri vAkpati bhatta, his fame had spread 
even to other countries abroad like China, Turkey and Persia.
He was the head of the kAma-kOti pITha for 52 years and attained
nirvANa on AShADa shukla pratipat day of siddhArthi samvatsara
of kali era 3941".
I have quoted above extracts from the article by 'H.G'
(= Prof. G Hanumanthachar, President, Sub-Committe on Philosophy
(tattva-shAstra), Kannada Encyclopedia, Mysore, India). 
Taking a difference of 3101 years between kali & common era,
his probable date would be  'died circa 840AD'.
-Sincerely,
Harihareswara
PS: Is the book 'Sri rudra-bhAShya' you have quoted available?
Where can I get a copy of it, please? Thanks!
