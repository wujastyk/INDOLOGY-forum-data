	Not in all cases has the translation done  correctly from Tamil 
	to Sanskrit .We see that with a certain motive in mind, the 
	translations have been bent to suit the motive.	
		WE find a certain trend in the Tamilland, during the
	Medieval times and thereafter. A town in order to have a 
	certain status, had to claim to greatness or create greatness.
		The easist way to claim that greatness was to have a
	Sthala Puranam. In order to give credibility and to sound 
	grandiose, Tamil names were Sanskritised.During the Pallava times 
	a deliberate step was taken to Tamilianise religion .But later, 
	it got 	reversed. Whatever was Tamil had to be Sanskritised.
		It was this reversed trend that actually made people 
	indulge inin translating.
		There is a place called "eRumbiyUr". It has been 	
	eulogised in thEvAram hymns as "thiruveRumbiyUr"."eRumbiyUr'
	is a place surrounded by hills.
		But the name underwent corruption and became,'eRumbUr".
	A "sthala purAnam" was created . It said that Siva was worshipped 
	by ANTS! in that place.Therefore the place was called 
	"thirueRumbUr' This was conveniently translated as 'pipIlikApuri"
	"pipIlikam" being Ant.

		:KodngunRam" means a leaning or bent hill."kodum"
	is bent. But the pandits translated it as "koTOra giri".
	"thiruk kodung gunRamudaiya nAyanAr' became 'kaTOra girIswarar'.
