 The two weaving women at the loom are mentioned in the year allegory of the
 Paushyaparvan of the Mahabharata (Mbh. 1.3.147,151,167,172).

Atharva Veda 10.8.42 also mentions a pair of maidens weaving. Whitney's
translation reads, " A certain pair of maidens, of diverse form, weave,
betaking themselves to it, the six-pegged web; the one draws forth the
threads (ta'ntu), the other sets [them]; they wrest not off (apa-vrj), they
go not to an end."
