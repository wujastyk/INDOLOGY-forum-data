Do I smell sour grapes fermenting? ;)

Is that the thanks we get for saving everybody's hide in WW II (if not for
us, Lance might be speaking German himself today), and for keeping the
world relatively tidy while defunct Imperialist expansionism implodes back
in on itself?

Seems to me the Indian passions are for cricket and (european/British)
football, not baseball or (American) football.

By the way, Robert, the last time I ran into someone revelling in
ethnocentricity, I was in Paris (just kidding; je suis desol?).
