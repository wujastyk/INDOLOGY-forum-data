Copyright
Thanks to Geprg v Simon for pointing out an absurdity in my previous
post. I had written:
  The owner of a manuscript possesses only those rights the author would
  possess, if he/she is/were alive.
The point is that nowdays the duration of copyright is defined as
life of the author + n years (except for works `made for hire'?)
So the last part should be changed ``to if he/she is alive or
been dead for less than 50 (70 in Germany etc) years''.
