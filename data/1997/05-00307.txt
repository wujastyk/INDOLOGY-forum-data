A personal message to Luis Gonzalez-Reimann
Hi Luis,
I wish you all success in your Mahabharata-yugas project. I also wish to
thank you for your thoughtful explanation of the yuga sequence and the yuga
names and associated colors in this very forum a couple of weeks ago. This
is a topic I knew nothing about, and I learned something from you.
Regards,
Beatrice
