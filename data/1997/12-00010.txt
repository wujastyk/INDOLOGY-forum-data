Kodama's email address
(Please allow me once only to use Indology for personal
communication.)
Dear Prof. Bh.Krishnamurti,
You complain that you do not get a reply from
Japan. Something is wrong about the connection between India
and Japan. I have sent my mail repeatedly, but every time it
has been rejected.
I am trying to find the e-mail address of Kodama-kun.
Please be patient a little more.
It was very nice to hear from you anyway.
With best regards,
                         ===============================================
