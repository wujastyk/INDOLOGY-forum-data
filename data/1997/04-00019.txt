A hearty yes to that. I find it fascinating that where the Sanskrit texts
seem to be silent about the relationship of the gAndhAra to shaDja, the
Tamil texts explicitly talk of the relationship of kaikkiLi and kuRal in
terms of friendship (naTpu) and enmity (pakai). I have always wondered if
the so-called gAndhAra grAma that is "sung only in heavenly realms" has
anything to do with this. And Bharata's demonstration notwithstanding, I
have found it impossible to make sense of the 22 Sruti theory without
assuming something about the gAndhAra. Ramanathan's analysis of the Tamil
references to 22 maattirais in an octave seemed to be much more
straightforward.

I remember S. Ramanathan using the term kuRal tiripu for the modal shift
of tonic, and paNNuppeyarttal for the change of intervals around a fixed
tonic.
