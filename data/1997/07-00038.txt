Horse, elephant and Dravidian

	A good idea, but difficult to apply. Eurindian *peku- is for
cattle, farm animals, subjects to razzia, later to commercial purposes. I
don't believe *ekwo- is a *peku-: azva is in the scope of ksatriyas and
pazu of vaisias.
	But a study of animal's classification (both arian and dravidian)
from different points of view (domestication, danger, sacrifice, God's
mount) would surely be interesting. I can't understand sanskrit nAga, I
find all usual explications too poor: when BhIma falls into the river, the
same nAgAs are masters of poison and strength!
