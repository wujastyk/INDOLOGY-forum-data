Dear Lars,
 May I also suggest for you to take a look at the following gentlemen,
/ladies in connection with your documentary shooting.....
1. Baba Amte- A social worker who has been nominated for the Noble
Prize, he helps rehabilitate leprosy patients. He has an Ashram in
Eastern Maharashtra( Chandrapur, I think) and has won a lot of
recognition for his work.
2. Annasaheb Hazare- This gentleman helped start co-operative farming
in Western Maharashtra, helped get illiterate and exploited farmers
get off the bottle and do something useful with their lives. I remember
seeing a documentary of sorts on Doordarshan on him.
3.Sunderlal Bahuguna- started the "Chipko" movement in the Garhwal area
in U.P., arguably Indias first grass roots movement in terms of
environmental protection. The name of the movement comes from the fact
that the volunteers would go and hug the trees and physically prevent
the tree from being cut down( i.e. Hindi "Chipakna"- literally,
sticking)...a novel application of Gandhi's Satyagraha technique.
4. Ela Ramesh Bhatt- Ahmedabad based social worker, contribution in
terms of organizing women workers organizations, won the Magsasay ward
some time ago.
5. Mahasweta Devi- well known Bengali authoress, known for work among
Adivasis, winner of the Magsasasy ward AND the Jnanpith Award( for
literary achievement in 1996)....no dearth of material about her,
Gayatri Chakravarty Spivak, the Columbia U based professor( the expert
on Sub-Altern studies) is her  official translator from Bengali into
English.
6. Outside India- In Bangladesh, you have the the story of the Grameen
Bank- a small co-operative bank that has helped small scale farmers
become succesful, stresses mainly on participation by women, think that
ABC made a documentary about them some time ago, again no dearth of
material about them.....

Regards,
Krishna
