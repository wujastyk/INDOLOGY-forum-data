Leitner
Dear Gabriele Zeller,
I am not a 19th century specialist, but Leitner specialized (among many
other things) on Dardic languages. There is an excellent description of him
as a person and a scholar in John Keay's _The Gilgit Game_ (Oxford U. P.),
and Leitner's _Dardistan in 1866, 1886 and 1893_ has been reprinted in New
Delhi (Manjusri Publishing House, 1978). The two works in tandem should
give you a good impression of his scholarly work.
With best wishes,
Ruth Schmidt (Dardic specialist)
