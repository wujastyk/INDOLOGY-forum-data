Few questions (vEL pAri) by N.Ganesan dated 1/10/97
About the former name of  later MaTTakkaLappu city, I agree with Ramani
that it was PuLiyantIvu, and not PuLiyaNkuLam - I am sorry that I made a
mistake. I have been following news of the battles raging around
PuLiyankuLam for many weeks in the north of my country that the similar
sounding name slipped into a wrong context.
