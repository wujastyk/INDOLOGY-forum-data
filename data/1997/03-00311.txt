One correction: the viol family is designated 'da gamba', and the viola da
gamba represents the gamba held between the legs like a cello. Modern
music instrument history acccounts two families: the viol family, with
curved plates; and the violin family, with curved ones. I wonder if viols
with adjustable frets would suit Indian music better than the louder
violin family?
