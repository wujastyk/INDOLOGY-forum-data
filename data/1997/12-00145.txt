address of J. L. Shaw
  Dear coleagues,
  does anybody of you know the whereabouts of
Dr. J. L. Shaw? If I'm not mistaken, he taught philosophy at Victoria
University of Wellington several years ago. I tried to find his e-mail
address through
Infoseek, but failed.
  Many thanks in advance.
  Sincerely Yours,
                    Olenev Dmitry
