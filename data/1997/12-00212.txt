Breaking down lines?
I'd forgotten the case of vowel sandhi. This can be solved by introducing
yet another new sign symbolised here by *: <...caaham...> -- for ca+aham --
could be written as <...caa *ham...>. Note this is a case where one has
problems even in translitteration, so this kind of thing can help there too.
