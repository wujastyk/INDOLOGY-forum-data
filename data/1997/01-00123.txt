Indra weakened
Dear Indologist,
        I remember a story where Indra after killing Vrtra was weakened,
flight and hide in a reed. He go out only after an other god (Agni,
Brhaspati ?) find him and praise him. But, after some research, I was
unable to find te source of this story.
        Can someone help me (first and best versions) ?
Many thanks,
