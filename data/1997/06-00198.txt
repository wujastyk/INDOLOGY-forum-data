oral transmission: motivation and memorization
I'm not sure what purpose learning the shape of the letters could
have, since he was blind.
I guess this kind of story don't worry to hard about making sense.
Also, I think I have some disagreement with you as to what "well
documented" means. Well-documented does *not* mean to me that lots
of people are repeating the story uncritically, which is what it
seems to mean to you.
Note I'm not completely skeptical about stories of incredible memories.
Simply that the myth vs. truth ratio in those stories is probably
something like 10 to 1. But the 10th that's left that's probably
true is still often amazing.
