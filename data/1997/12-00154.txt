Summer Skt at Harvard
In addition to Vancouver and Ann Arbor, we have been offering Summer
Sanskrit since 1988.
However, always as an *introduction* to Sanskrit.
If there is enough interest for 2nd year Skt., I may change plans.
I always have had a few requests, but not enough to start a course.
If you are interested, please write to me privately, at the above address.
For those interested in 1st year Skt, I attach last year's announcement.
The new one is not yet out; it will be more or less the same.
