is retained even now.  From my interaction with Malayalam speakers,
I think that they wouldn't find the above example hard at all since,
in general, they seem to keep the dental/alveolar n's quite distinct.
[If I try to say nA_n correctly, I sound like a Malayali ;-)))]

        (similar to Midwestern American r). The two r's are: r= alveolar flap or
        single tap; R/_r is an alveolar trill which developed from Proto-Dravidian
        alveolar stop in the intervocalic position. Like Old Tamil,Old Telugu and
        Old Kannada also had two r's but in modern languages there is only one; the
        trill R merged with the flap r. Only Tamil scholars try to distinguish the
        two in reading.

It is interesting that you don't consider Malayalam once again...
in my experience, Malayalis indeed preserve the r/_r distinction
quite clearly... and so do SriLankan Tamils.
