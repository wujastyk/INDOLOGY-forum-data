Namaste!

A couple of comments bout the nitpicking in a previous message:
Please obtain an atlas contemporaneous with the quoted text to 
locate the said sarovar. :)
President Clinton, meeting Hawaii's Democratic senator in 
California this morning said, "We'll have to cross the big pond [referring to about 2,500 miles of ocean] and visit y'all in 
Hawaii again one of these days."  "Sarovar", similarly could easily
have been used to denote "sea".

Aloha from Hawaii where tradewinds flow!
(Exercise for the reader: "Hawaii" and Havaa=wind connection?)
