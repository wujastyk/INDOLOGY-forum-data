In Puram 27, it is said that those kings/chieftains praised by poets will
attain the ' pilot-less sky vehicle' by the words "pulavar pATum pukazuTaiyOr
vicumpin valavan EvA vAnavUrti eytuba".
In CilappatikAram 23.197-200, the king of gods and other gods arrive in a
'sky vehicle' with resurrected kOvalan and pick up kaNNaki.
"amarark karacan tamar vantEttak
kOnakar pizaitta kOvalan RannoTu
