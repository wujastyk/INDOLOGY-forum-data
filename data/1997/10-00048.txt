the word meaning Brahmine'
Te. paaRu~Du instead of paaru~Du even in the oldest inscriptions show that
the R started merging with r very early. So this was a reverse spelling or
hyperstandard spelling. All  literary South Indian Languages lost the
contrast between R and r quite early (except perhaps Malayalam and Toda).
So the correct spelling of the Telugu word was paaru~Du 'seer,
Brahmin',which is cognaate with Ta. Ma. and Ka. word. Bh. Krishnamurti
