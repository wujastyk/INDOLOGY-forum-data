The aNubhAshya on the brahmasUtras by AnandatIrtha (madhva) is available
as a .gif file and in transliterated (ITRANS) format at the Sanskrit
Documents List available at
<ftp://jaguar.cs.utah.edu/private/sanskrit/sanskrit.html>. If you do
not have a web-browser, you can also connect via ftp. Login anonymously
and follow the directory structure as indicated above. 

Other than this text, I am not aware of any other bhAshyas in electronic
form.
