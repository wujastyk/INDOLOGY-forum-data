Sandhi in `real' Sanskrit vs `conversational' Sanskrit

The editor's introduction in the HSS I referred to earlier notes
that in some verses attributed to Bhart.rhari, sandhi is
occasionally not applied at the caesura. In the Kaavyas, sandhi
is applied between the padas, but not always in puraa.nas. 
In Tamil, for novels, prose works expounding some aspect of
Tamil literature or cilture etc, sandhi is applied only for
word/morpheme groups that form a whole, like words forming a
compound verb. 
Between articles and associated nouns, between (some) prepositions and
associated nouns etc. Do you mean to say that sandhi is applied in
print between the object and the verb, between the subject and the
verb? My reading of French is for the most part limited to math
papers, but I don't even remember sandhi being applied in print
between adjective and the noun.
`less far-reaching' is to put it mildly.
We are going around in circles here. What is `real Sanskrit'? What features
must the dialect have before it is `real' Sanskrit? I get the feeling that
the answer will end up being ``Whatever features of Sanskrit I know''.
And what is >the< `full variety'? Is it `the full variety' if I say
`prabhaate kaaphi apibam'? [Did "Saakalya speak `real' Sanskrit? :-^]
What about `godser gaandhim ahan'? Can one have servicable Sanskrit
by knowing only the imperfect, as Professor Deshpande implied in
his reply, or would you disagree with it? Would it be `the
full variety' if baadhate and kli"snaati are used interchangeably?
What about siidati and aaste? Where does one draw the line?
