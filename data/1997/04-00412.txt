India's role in the history of linguistics
 Dear Marcin
 You could look at the following:
G.Sastri.1959. The Philosophy of Word and Meaning. Sanskrit College, Calcutta.
Pandey, R.C.  1963. The Problem of Meaning in Indian Philosophy. Motilal 
     Banarasidas.
Raja, K.Kunjunni. 1963. Indian Theories of Meaning. 
Chakravarti, P. 1933. Linguistic Speculations of the Hindus.
Cheers.
