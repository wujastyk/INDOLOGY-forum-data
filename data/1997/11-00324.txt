This is fascinating.  Could you please mention
which two places you are referring to?  Thanks
in advance.
The two places which I have seen being identified/confounded
with "Potalaka" are:
(1) the Dalai Lama's "Potala" palace in Lhasa (a somewhat
    natural conception, since Tibetans consider the Dalai Lama
    to be an embodiment of Avalokiteshvara bodhisattva).
(2) the island of Pu'to, off the southern coast of China,
    which is considered the "home" of Kuan-yin, the
    Chinese (female) bodhisattva of compassion.
