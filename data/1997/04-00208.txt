 the warp, and also his assertion that "this meaning also makes sense
 because the warp is the fixed and permanent element, while the woof
 represents movement and change."

The link between 'pA', the warp, and 'pA', the verse,  in Dravidian gets even
more interesting. The fundamental metrical unit of Tamil prosody is called
'acai' which also means 'to move, to shake' (DED 39) and 'to tie, to bind'
(DED 43).
