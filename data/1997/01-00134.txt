Subject: A meter in the Bhagavata Purana

 In response to the query regarding the metre in Bhagavat 10.31, my son 
Muktak tells me that Apte does list the meter on p. 16 of Appendix A (II) 
in Vol. 3, by the names Raajaha.msii and Vibhuu.sa.naa. Arindam 
Chakravarti told him that from verse 10.31.01 the name Indiraa is 
commonly applied to the meter. It is a variety of Kaamadaa.
