Aeronautics in Ancient India?
Just a point about logic...
The claim that "there are no manuscripts of the
work and it must therefore be a fabrication"
is not, by itself, logically valid.
E.g., the claim that "there are no photographs of
your great-grandmother and she must therefore not
have existed" is not, by itself, logically valid.  :-)
Take it easy,

PS:  This doesn't mean I'm defending the genuineness
     of the "Brihat Vimana Samhita".  Just pointing
     out flawed logic.
