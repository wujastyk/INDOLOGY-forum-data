Tamil aaytam[aaydam] identified as PDlaryngeal
I am giving below the abstract of a paper on Ancient Tamil aaytam which has
not been related to Common Dravidain Phonology untill now. I suggested that
it was a relic reflex a Proto-Dravidain laryngeal (a h-type of sound similar
to Sanskrit visarga)some 34 years ago and I find more and more evidence.
Only scholars with analytical knowledge of Old Tamil phonology can throw
light on this problem as well as Comparative Dravidian scholars. I would
wellcome suggestions:Abstract:
Proto-Dravidian Laryngeal *H Revisited

 Old Tamil records of  the early Christian era (3rd century BC to 3rd
century AD) noted the occurrence of a phoneme called ?ytam with some kind of
h-colouring in about a dozen lexical items. Tamil Lexicon transliterates it
as /k(bar underneath)/, transcribed here as h(subdot).  Its distributional
properties include the following: (a) h(subdot) generally occurs after a
short vowel, (b) it lengthens the preceding vowel compensatorily, (c) it
gets assimilated to the following voiceless  stop, (d) it is lost  before
most consonants, (e) it alternates with a semi-vowel *y or *w
