German Indology
Nationality is definitely not the criterion used for this booklet - there
are dozens of non-Germans included. "German Indology" lists 1)
"institutions and persons concerned with Sanskrit and allied studies" in
German speaking countries (Germany, Austria, German speaking Switzerland),
2) Indologists in other countries whose mother tongue happens to be German
(like Siegfried Lienhard, a citizen of Sweden, and myself, living in
Norway). This may be objectionable, but it is rather convenient, after all.
I must admit that I often use this "distasteful" little book and that I
feel obliged to Dieter Schlingloff, who has compiled the data for the 1996
edition.
Best wishes
