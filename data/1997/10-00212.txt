that Deepangudi near Dindivanam to be the birthplace of JayamkoNDar.
U. V. Saminathaiyar & R. Raghavaiyangar have said this also.
(But for others, they are not sure whether the village in Dindivanam
or in Tanjore District.) This work sheds new light.
All 550 lines has "takara varga etukai"! I believe this is
the fourth work in Tamil that has the same etukai/prAsam.
Tirumangai Alvar's two maDals, TattuvarAyar's kalimaDal
are the only other books that have same etukai in the entire
gamut of tamil literature. But those maDals are
much smaller than JayamkoNDar's work.
I have two questions:
a) In the parapaksha section, the author criticizes Buddhists
as:
                                    "tampaciyin
   vaatai tavira manamtiriyAk kanjcitanaip
   pOtuceya vENTip putumarutap pUvaTutta
   pItaka aaTai uTalmUTip  pEyttanamaayc
   caatukamE kallukamE caaturika maalaikaLin

Rough translation:
To remove hunger, Buddhists take a food that does not
spoil the mind; they use dress whose color is made into
orange by boiling cloth with 'marutam' flowers. They
always tell "caatukamE, kallukamE, caaturikamE" or a
string of variations of these words. They do meditation
in the holes of old trees for liberation.
