hair's colour in Sanskrit
Really - i hav never come across that one - and I should know. i am from
Bambay, and a konkaNastha brAhmaNa too !!!!
Not just lower caste - but just lower. I have had to tell people off, and
even ask some to leave my home to protect my daughter from acquiring a
complex because of her skin colour which is darker than mine. 
By the way, i can thingk of atleast a few different words for describibg
skin colour shades in marathi and hindi. Obviously there shuld be many more
in otehr Indian languages.
