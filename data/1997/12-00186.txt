Favor needed: Dead phone
I am the team leader for automation and telephones in my division.  We
need to know by testing which of our telephones are set up to make
overseas long distance calls.  Would someone on the list in Europe (the
Continent or Great Britain), please convey to me - off the list - a telephone
number in his institution which does not have an answering machine or
audix and which will not have anyone around it to answer when the
institution is closed?  That way I can see if the phones call overseas
without my institution being billed and without wasting your people's time
picking up the phone or listening to audix messages.  If you can provide
this, please also tell me the hours the phone will or will not be attended.
Thanks,
Allen
