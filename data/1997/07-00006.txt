Translations of Gitagovinda into Indian Languages (Telugu)
Since I have sent the posting below I have been able to locate
the telugu Gitagovinda. I beg the indulgence of list members for
the inaccuracy of the author's name. The translator's name is
Sri Venkatadri Apparao ( zamindar of vuyyur) and NOT Sri M.R.Apparao, 
erstwhile while vice-chancellor of Andhra University. The confusion
is regretted. 
Sarma.
