Folks,
	I deleted the question concerning manuscripts of the Ganeshpurana,
but remember that the message mentioned three printed editions now being
used as sources.  I wonder if these three include an old block-printed
edition from Pune published in the year 1798 (Shaka era), 1876 AD?  I have
a copy of this edition in my personal collection, but it may be available
elsewhere.
	All the best,
					Madhav Deshpande
