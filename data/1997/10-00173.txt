In Christopher Queen's (ed.) volume of essays on Engaged Buddhism, you may
find an article on TBMSG, an organization based in the Mahar Buddhists who
converted at Ambedkar's instigation. Under the banner of 'right livelihood',
it is engaged in organizing these poorest members of society into
cooperatives and training them in various trades. It is fascinating to note
that TBMSG has its roots in the Friends of the Western Buddhist Order, based
in Great Britain.
