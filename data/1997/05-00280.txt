Jains and violence
My primary interest is in cosmology/cosmogony, although I also take an
interest in Arthashastra. As for politics and violence, I know of very few
if any religions that have made it beyond being a small-time sect that were
able to contain violence in politics, even if they in principle wanted to.
Christianity is a case in point, but I can hardly see that Buddhist and
Jaina kings were able to contain violence in the highly competitive world of
South Asian politics. Realizing religious ideals are usually the job of
specialists, e.g. monks or nuns, or the odd idealistic layman.
