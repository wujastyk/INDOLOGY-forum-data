Of chilies, tomatoes and other delicacies
There are several foods that originated in Central America and then spread
to other continents.
Among the better known ones are:
chili
tomato
chocolate
avocado
Their names are derived from the Nahuatl words:
chilli
tomatl
xocolatl
ahuacatl
Maize comes from Taino mahiz.
And potatoes, by the way, are neither German nor Irish.  They come from
South America.
