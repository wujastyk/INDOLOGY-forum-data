Earliest Hominids in South Asia
Hi All
I was trying to find some information regarding the fossils of the
earliest hominids in South Asia. Are there any early hominid fossils
excavated from India? If so , how old have they been dated as? In
particular, i am looking for information on the fossils of homo sapiens.
Pointers to  any references would be really appreciated. 
Thanks
Senthil
