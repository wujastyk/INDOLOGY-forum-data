Aghoris
Could you please help a Nepalese colleague who is not connected.
Do you know of any new study on the Aghorapanthis or Aghoris? He is
publishing a paper on that but he has only a couple of books and one
paper on/around the topic (Hara, Lorenzen, Barthakuria).
Thank you in advance,
Enrica
p.s. We know the Aghora page...
