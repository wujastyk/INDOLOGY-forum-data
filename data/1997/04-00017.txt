In recent times (100-150 years), in Carnatic music, the aim of
accompaniment has typically been to follow the vocalist like a shadow. The
Tamil term used is "nezhal pOla". Many Carnatic musicians use the word
"follow" synonymously with "accompany".
North Indian khayaal singers seem to prefer saarangii or harmonium
accompaniment. And khayaal has been steadily replacing dhrupad as the
most widespread genre since the times of Tansen. 
This suggestion makes a lot of sense. Certainly, a plucked stringed
instrument can accompany non-tom in dhrupad, or the taanam in Carnatic
music extremely well. 
Actually, the use of the Veena to accompany vocal Carnatic music is not
entirely unknown. There is a recording of Smt. M. S. Subbalakshmi
accompanied by Sri K. S. Narayanaswamy on the Veena. The famous Veena
Dhanammal used to sing and play the Veena at the same time. However,
one perceived problem in Veena accompaniment to vocal music in modern
times is one of pitch. The Veena used to be tuned to G or G# at the turn
of the century, but the preferred pitch has come down to D# or E, which is
too low for female voices and probably too high for most male voices.
Also, modern audiences have gotten used to violin accompaniment, and there
seems to be a great inertia against switching to anything else. 
Another experiment that has been tried recently is one by Dr.
Balamuralikrishna, who has sung concerts with flute accompaniment. 
Yes, these things have changed over time. In fact, the history of Carnatic
music in the 19th and 20th centuries is one of rather rapid change in many
things. One factor that has changed the aims and preferences of
accompaniments in recent times is the shift in venue from an intimate
private room to a public auditorium.
