The relevent sutras of pANini are

        sasajuSOh ruh 8.2.66

(`s' and `sajuS' at the end of the word become `r')

        kharavasAnayOh visarjanIyah 8.3.15

(`r' at the end of the word or followed by `khar' becomes visarga)

`khar' stands for letters kha,pha,cha,Tha, tha,ca,Ta,ta,ka pa,za,Sa,sa. I
have given them in the same order in which they occur in the pratyAhAra sajJa.
I think linguists call them voiceless consonents.( Hope I am right.)

sarma.
