	Naaraaya.nabha.t.ta uses the expression kalaayaavalii several
times in his famous poem Naaraayaa.niiya.  As far as I can tell, it must
be kalaaya + aavalii, a row/line of kalaaya.  The dictionary meaning of
kalaaya (Apte) is "green peas", (vaa.taa.naa in Marathi).  I wonder if
anyone knows the significance of this expression in the context of
describing the Krishna image in the temple at Guruvaayur?  
	Thanks.
