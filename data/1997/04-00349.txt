Is this a real reason, or is this only a pretext and is the real reason
intellectual laziness and a general degeneration in standards?

I know Western social scientists who claim to be experts on Karnataka but who
cannot produce a single correct sentence of Kannada. Still nicer: I once heard
a lady who knew no Kannada speak at an international conference about oral
epics in Kannada. (And this is not because there is a wealth of good writing on
these topics in English or other European languages.) Recently there was
mention of "Danielou's" translation of Ma.nimeekalai on this list. All sorts of
things are going on nowadays.

I do not see a necessary connection here. In Toronto we had the phenomenon of
North Indian students who already knew at least some Hindi taking Hindi for
their "humanities requirement" -- the staff suspected that this was because the
students thought they could pass easily!
