Geometry and numerals
Hello to everybody,
a friend of mine is searching for bibliographical data on publications 
(if possible in English or German translations) about "Geometry"  and 
"Mysticism of Numerals".
I myself thought at once about handbooks of architecture ("Mayamata", 
"Agamas" etc.)
Moreover, are there any texts in "lyrical" form about these topics?
Best wishes  ULRIKE
