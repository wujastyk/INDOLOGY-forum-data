Faith in Hinduism
I'm sure John has already thought of this, but there is of course some
mention of these topics in the Bhagavadgita, for instance towards the end of
the fourth chapter:
        'sraddhaavaal labhate j?aana.m tatpara.h sa.myatendriya.h ...
        aj?a's caa'sraddadhaana's ca sa.m'sayaatmaa vina'syati
these passages?
