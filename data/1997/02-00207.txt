IJTS: Nina Fonts for Devanagari
Dear Colleagues,
We have just posted the new encoding for the Nina Fonts for Devanagari on the 
*International Journal of Tantric Studies*. It can be seen at: 
http://www.shore.net/ijts/nina.html
It has been designed by our Technical Editor, Dr. Arch. Ludovico Magnocavallo for the 
IJTS.
The Nina Fonts will be released next week in Type1 and TrueType formats for Windows. 
The Nina Fonts for Macintosh systems will be released a few weeks later.  
Please look at the new encoding and give us your feedback before Ludovico finishes up 
the Nina Fonts. 
Thank you for your consideration and your help,
Dr. Enrica Garzilli
Univ. of Perugia (ITALY)
Editor-in-Chief, IJTS and JSAWS (http://www.shore.net/~india)
