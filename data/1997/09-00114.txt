Sounds like something James Churchward wrote in his "Lost Continent of

On a more serious note. I originally read these books by Churchward
sometime in the 5th grade. I never actually learned what these Naacal
tablets were that Churchward claimed held the secrets of Mu, Lemuria, etc.
He wrote that some Indian mystic had these tablets stashed away and
decided to show them to Churchward after some insistance. I always doubted
the authenticity of these rumoured tablets. Have there been any
Indologists who have actually looked into Churchward's story?
