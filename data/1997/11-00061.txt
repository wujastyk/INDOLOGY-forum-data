        I suppose you intend mantrazAstra bIjAkSarAs. But is 'hsauh' a
*Sanskrit* word or first syllab ?  It sound like the voice of a furious
Naga and seems onomatopeic ...
        MMW dictionary ends with 'hveya'. Where this 'hsauh' is attested ?
Why it is writed in devanagari ? It's a ligature for 'h'+'s' ?
