nAma
some informations concerning the topic:
know only a vast number of examples of litanies to the deities of the
pancAyatana-group)
Chinmaya, Ramana Maharshi, Amma). Is it a modern practice or do you know
litanies to historical saints?
especially those of the saints of the Kaveri-delta/Tanjavur (SadAshiva
Brahmendra, Bodhendra, SadgurusamI). Is LaxmIdhara's BhagavannAmakaumudI
edited or even translated?
Krishna and synonyms (To my knowledge there seems to be no restriction, but
rather dependence on certain sampradAyas, initiated by gurus) 
interviews I got the impression that the practice is rather outdated)
