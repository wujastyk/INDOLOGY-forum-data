a you sure of this derivation?  SKEAT derives "cash" from French "casse",
in turn from Latin "capsa" 'box'.  MEYER-LUEBKE /romanisches etymol.
woerterbuch/ gives Portuguese "caixa" /kaiSa/ from "capsa", which of course
can have undergone a shift in meaning from denoting the 'cash-box' /cf.
German "kasse"/ to denoting its contents, or had such a shift reinforced,
under influence of the Indic word.  the English "cash" looks like derived
from the Portuguese more than anything else.
indeed.  as if India needed to have its greatness confirmed by the OED!
has the writer been sleeping since the twenties?
indeed.  I wrote a short story -- or rather a chapter in a series of
stories -- set in an alternative history where the first world war had
ended with German victory.  in the story britain had been conquered and the
prince who in real history was Edward VIII had founded an "empire" in exile
consisting of british India, australia and the former "dutch India".  I
used hobson-jobson to construct a hilarious jargon for some of the
characters -- late twentieth-century 'Englishmen' from that state.
it all hinges on the question if modern civilization exists ;-)
