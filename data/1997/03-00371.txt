With all due respect, Dominique, I don't think that Jacob's question is
xenophobic! There are a lot of scholars out there, some of whom have
produced more valuable work than others. I, too, sometimes ask colleagues if
this or that scholar is worth my time, and I am interested in the personal
qualities of the individual scholar. I may ask the same question about
English, German or American scholars, or for that matter about scholars of
any nationality. 
Best regards,
