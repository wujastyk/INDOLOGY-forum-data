In Swami Chidbhavananda's commentary of the Bhagavad Gita(6.34), the
word Krishna is explained as "a person who has control over the
mind".The first part of the name "Krish" means "to plough and process",
the latter part "Na" means "the master of". So Krishna means "the master
of the act of ploughing and processing the mind" or in short, someone
who has control over the mind. Swami Chidbhavananda has explained this
in Chapter VI of the Bhagavad Gita, in the context of controlling the
mind in meditation.
