epics and oral traditions
George Thompson:
Panini presents the same challenges, except in even more acute ways,
doesn't he? (Since I believe it is generally accepted he was not acquainted
with writing, even though this is not a necessary implication of the form
of the work: Cardano, after all, put his method for solving cubics into
Latin hexameters, so designing a work for oral learning does not imply
necessarily that one has not used writing while composing it)
This is just an invitation to Panini scholars to join in this most
interesting thread :)
