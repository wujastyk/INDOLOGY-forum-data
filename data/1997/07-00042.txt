I remember when I was in Tuebingen some years ago (1992 i think) I was told
that they had managed to "teach" the OCR program Optopus (spelling correct)
to scan devanagari. I had been fairly difficult, and there had been rather a
lot of errors. But in principle, Optopus could be taught to recognize any
pattern as a letter or a combination of lettes. I used it to scan a
romanized Sanskrit text and taught it to give cerebral t's, d's etc. as .t,
.d etc. It worked reasonable well.
