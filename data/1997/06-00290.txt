hindu once again
This parallels the preference of ISKCON to call itself a Vedic rather 
than a Hindu movement. On the other hand, it is hard to see how *every* 
place that is currently called a 'Hindu temple' could be called a 'Vedic 
temple'.
To make sense of the information, we have to note that 'Parsi' in this 
context doesn't have its usual meaning of 'Zoroastrian'. It clearly means 
'Persian', or rather 'of Persian language and/or culture', and 'Parsi 
religion' refers to Islam.
