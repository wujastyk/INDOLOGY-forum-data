Dear members of the Indologist List,

I did not mention in my posting yesterday that the word rishi, the origin of
which has been said to be uncertain, is also suspected to have been derived
from a word meaning: 'push.'  Here, (remembering the exchange in s and sh,
which has been noted in the document on the World Wide Web) note the Kannada
word: sari, which, even though does not precisely denote: push, has a related
meaning: to move, go or move to one side (DED. #2360). The meanings of the
related Dravidian words in the same group (DED. #2360) such as to bend down,
be diminished, step aside! get out of the way! are interesting to note in
light of some ancient sages' disposition to be very particular about things
they really cared for: reverence to them.

There is also the other word ras 'yell'  from which also the word rishi is
suspected to have been derived. Here, note the Kannada word: usir, which
denotes: to utter (DED. #937). The important point is that these Kannada
words denote all those meanings of the words from which the word rishi is
suspected to have been derived. And also, the order of the consonants of
these Kannada words is in the reverse order in the word rishi, which is an
essential character of the linguistic phenomenon of inversion and
substitution or cryptography in Dravidian.      

Speaking of rishis, no Indologist worth his or her salt will admit that he
does not know the chief character manifested by the rishi, NArada. Even
though he tried to do some good things, by accident, perhaps, he has been
mainly infamous for creating mischief  in all the known worlds. One of his
chief weapons which, to the atmost distress of both gods and men, he employed
very successfully in these activities was accusing with which, of course,
went such other things as blaming.

Here, let us note the Dravidian Tulu word: dUruni, of which the name NArada
is an inverted and substituted form. This word dUruni precisely denotes: to
accuse, complain, blame, reproach, censure, for alll of which NArada is
infamous. It is interesting to note the meanings of the related words in the
same group (DED. #3397): to slander,  publish abroad ill-reports, defame,
tell a lie, report evil of others, mention the name of a person, cite,
reproach, praise, honour, to cause to abuse (and in the noun form:)
information laid against a person, an accuser, and a tale bearer!  This
certainly looks like NArada's resume. Best regards.

Yours
