thank you for your elaborate answere
 you made your point very clear except on one issue: the different sorts of
science.
i don't think reductionism, according to which one science explains the
axiomas, thoerical terms and basic fenomena of another, is a tenable point of
view. on the contrary: i agree with Peter Winch ('The idea of a Social Science
- Routl & Kegan Paul 1958): there's a fundamental difference between
object-sciences and social-sciences. i think there is an equally fundamental
difference between those two and linguistic sciences like philogy and
semiology. 

i had antropology, philology and semiology in mind when i defended the right
of science to investigate religious phenomena and texsts.

i would reckon those texts as scientific ones. even Capra's view on physics
have been severly criticised by experts, let alone his hopelessly romantic
view on oriental mysticism

of course, but inthis case Einstein's religious feelings were disturbed by
implications of scientific developments. i wouls say this is very human, but
not very philosophical. if he had read Nietzsche he would not be that
surprised.

it's a pity most theologians prefer Barth to BhartRhari
