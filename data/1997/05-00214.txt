Very well! I thought arithmetic was a branch of mathematics, I apologize for
my ignorance.

That may be a good reason to investigate them! Even if we think such
properties are trivial, the ancients may not have thought so.

I thought it might be.... Actually, the question is not what modern people
think about numerology (there are some who believe in it), but what people
thought in ancient times. As for "sacred" numbers, in Indo-European cultures
there are the numbers 3, 7 and 9 that are all invested with special
meanings. 7 represents the orifices of the head, 9 the orifices of the whole
body. Read Eric Pirart's paper on the subject which I quoted a few emails ago!

Unhappily, due to the exorbitant prices on alcohol in Norway, there is
little Aquavit to be had for 10 dollars. (You may at best get 4 cl in a
restaurant). But I always cherish the thought of an Aquavit, and as we say
here: It is the thought that counts!
