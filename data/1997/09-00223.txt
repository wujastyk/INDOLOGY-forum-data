Online Searchable Vedic Conc.
Members of the list; thank you for your reference to Lubotsky's AOS
RV Concordance. However I am also looking (in vain) for any searchable
Vedic text indexes on the WWW. I have heard about the MhBh site and was
hoping there was a searchable RV samhita, AV samhita etc. In fact any such
site featuring texts up until middle-late Upanisads would be of tremendous
help. Thank you again for any assistance you may offer.
