Autobiography of S. C. Bose
Dear Indology List Member,
I have an enquiry regarding the autobiography of Subhas Chandra Bose.
The title is : "An Indian Pilgrim".
I have been informed that this book had been published sometime ago by "Konark 
Publications". I have no further information as to the whereabouts of this
publishing house. While I seek confirmation on this and the complete address of
Konark Publishers, I would like to know if there is any other source from
where I could get this book.
I would also like to know if the "Netaji Research Bureau" in Calcutta could help
in any way.
Thanks & Regards,
Sreenivasa Nittala
