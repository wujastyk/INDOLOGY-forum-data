Indo-Germanic
lgr> like to ask our German (or German speaking) colleagues their
lgr> opinion concerning the use of the term Indo-Germanic, as opposed
lgr> to Indo-European.
German Indo-Europeanists do use also use the term "indoeropaeisch", but
as far I can see it was mostly used by _East_german scholars. 
"Indoeropaeisch" sounds just like belonging to Eastern _official_
terminology.
 (Please note: as you can read, I am also not a German! :-}
