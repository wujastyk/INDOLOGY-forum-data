In Maharashtra, the

This is total news for me. By the way I am a Koaknastha, and for a while
was married to a Deshastha. 

The perjoratives that I do knwo that each of these sub-castes utter about
each other are more in the line of - Kokanasthas being very stingy and
penny pinching, and the Deshasthas having no discipline etc.

And as for the "Cobras" i have not heard the perjorative. Infact, I have
many times (along with a lot of others that i know ) have called myself
Cobra, more as a shorthand than anything else.
