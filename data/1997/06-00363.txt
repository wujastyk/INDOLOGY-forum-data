Namaskaar Birodhkar ji:

Your reply is excellent.
The suppression of knowledge and theft of indigenous treasures the colonial
barbarians perpetrated in most of the world for centuries has left its
hangover in the minds of many.  Unfortunately, some of these victims can be
found in the faculties of world's major universities even today.  This year
as Bharat celebrates the 50th anniversary of its disentanglement from the
foreign savages,  and as Hong Kong relieves itself of similar disease, let us
work together to remove all obstacles in the quest for the real truth in a
freer world.
