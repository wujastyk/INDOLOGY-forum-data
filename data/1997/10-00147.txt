Review of "The Dating of the Historical Buddha"
Regarding reviews of the two volume (a third in press, if I'm not
mistaken) collection of essays on the dating of the historical Buddha:
Lance Cousins published a very informative review in Buddhists Studies
Review (London). I don't, however, have my copy with me so I can't be
very specific. BSR publishes two issues a year and it was in 1996 or 1997.
