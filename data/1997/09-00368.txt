Looking for an aussie
Dear Indology netters,
excuse me for asking a non-indological question, but I am pretty hard up for
an answer. Could anybody explain the expression "layback" in the following
sentence:
"Happy hours, discount drinks and irresponsible promotions such as laybacks
were found to be a prime cause of violence in Australia."
Thanx in advance!
Best regards,
Lars Martin Fosse
