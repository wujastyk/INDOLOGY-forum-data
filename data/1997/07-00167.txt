Dear members of the list,

I forward this query from a colleague. Kindly address your replies to Elena
Bashir at:

	neena at gps.caltech.edu

"Is there anything out there that can scan Devanagari and do an OCR
type thing on it converting it to a Roman transliteration?  Is this still out
of the realm of the possible, or is someone working on it?  Given the
increased interest in textual studies these days, someone might be."

Thank you.

With nest wishes,

Ruth Schmidt
