Subject: Etymon: paTTaN, pattan, patan
Message-ID: <161227033685.23782.14352634722531936408.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dominique Thillaud makes an excellent point linking the etymon to av.
peretuS (ford).

Patan is the name of a town (3 km. from Kathmandu) on the southern bank of
Bagmati river in Nepal. The etymon may relate to a ferry point on a river
or a port?

Re: alternances with tIrthas or saras; some names which come to mind are:
brahmasar (KurukSetra), jyotisar, thanesar--all are tIrthas.

On another note, are haTTa (market) and paTTi relatable?
