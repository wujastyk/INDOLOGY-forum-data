Etymon: paTTaN, pattan, patan
Dominique Thillaud makes an excellent point linking the etymon to av.
peretuS (ford).
Patan is the name of a town (3 km. from Kathmandu) on the southern bank of
Bagmati river in Nepal. The etymon may relate to a ferry point on a river
or a port?
Re: alternances with tIrthas or saras; some names which come to mind are:
brahmasar (KurukSetra), jyotisar, thanesar--all are tIrthas.
On another note, are haTTa (market) and paTTi relatable?
