ivy's names
Dear Indologists,
        The belgian scholar Erik Seldeslacht gave me an interresting answer
about the ivy and sended me a list of various Indian names for this plant:
Beas: Brumbrumdakari (sic)
Behar: Lablab
Chenab: Kurol
Hazara: Arbambal
Jaunsar: Mithiari
Jhelum: Arbambal, Halbambar
Kashmir: Karmora, Mandia
Kumaon: Banda
Malayalam: Maravala
Nepal: Dudela
Pashto: Parwata
Ravi: Karun (or Karur?), Kuri
Sutlej: Kadloli, Kaneri, Kaniuri, Karbaru
Tamil: Maravalai
        Alas, I'm quite ignorant of the modern Indian languages and unable
to know the etymologies of this words (except the Pashto one who seems
clear). Can specialists help me ? Does it possible that 'brumbrumdakari'
comes from 'sound of thunder' + (u)daka ?
        Thanks in advance,
Dominique
