E. V. Ramaswami Naicker (1878-1972)

Anita Diehl, Periyar E. V. Ramaswami: a study of the influence of a
personality in contemporary South India. Bombay 1978.


Periyar's Reading of Ramayana is interesting.
See Paula Richman's article in P. Richman (ed.), Many Ramayanas,
Univ. of California press.

E. V. Ramaswami Periyar, The Ramayana: a true reading.
2nd edition, Trichy, 1972


For situating Periyar in Tamil Nadu's 20th century history and the
Dravidian movement,

See:
Charles A. Ryerson, Regionalism & Religion: The Tamil renaissance
and popular Hinduism, CLS, Madras, 1988

Eugene F. Irschick, Tamil revivalism of the 1930s.
Univ. of Calif. press, 1986


Hope these references on Periyar are helpful,
