In an article entitled, "Etymology of Place-Names PaTTi-HaTTi: Some
Observations on the History of Maharashtra and Karnataka", in Annals of
Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, 1951, Vol. 32, pp.41-56, S.B. Joshi
gives a Dravidian origin for words like, paTTi, paTTaNa, haTTi, pADa, vADa,
vADi, etc.
