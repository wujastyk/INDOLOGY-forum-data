First of all I did not assert anything. I have only said
If one has come across, one is welcome to share it with the members of the
list. That is what this list is for - to exchange information. If every
body knew everything there will be nothing to communicate and there will be
no
necessity of the list. I do not claim that I am omniscient and I hope that
others also do not claim to be one. If every body waited till they consulted
everything to press the button one may not get a chance to press it at all.
I have consulted the dictionaries available to me. They do not list under
the word tArakA the meaning the wife of bRhaspati. Whereas in case of tArA
they do. This clearly shows that tArA is the most wellknown name for the wife
of bRhaspati.
Even the exerpt given by you
     ^^^^
gives the name tArA for the wife of bRhaspati.
A little more information about the references Mr.Vassilkov has given will
be welcome.
