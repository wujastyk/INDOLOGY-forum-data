I would assume that the editor/transcriber of the text would have rights
belonging to his edition of the electronic text, and would need to be
consulted with prior to distribution. Especially in this case, where
assuming that the texts are in the public domain, and are being used for
commercial distribution.

Sure. But the texts in question _are_ transliterations, of which there
exist copies available for scholarly use. I think the principle being
questioned is the distribution of someone's work without their prior
consent.
