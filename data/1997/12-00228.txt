Dr Klaus Dieter Mathes (also to be contacted by e-mail:
mathes at nrc.wlink.com.np), the present German Representative of the NGMPP
in Nepal, asked me to convey the following message to the list:

He is, as Prof. Axel Michaels has pointed out, ready to help people
getting the copies they need frm the National Archives, but he asks
people not to expect that it will be a matter of days. First, the copies
have to be ordered in the National Archives, then an advance has to be
paid, then the copies have to be picked up and paid for, then they have
to be packed, and dispatched to Hamburg by diplomatic courrier. At the
University in Hamburg they have to be repacked, before they can finally
be forwarded to the person who ordered them in the first place.
Obviously with so many hands involved there may be delays. This will be
notaby the case when Dr Mathes is out of town, which he frequntly is
when going on  microfliming expeditions.

The entire procedure of getting films in this way is inofficial (in
theory Dr Mathes will be customer of the National Archive instead of the
persons ordering the film). Really, the films should be ordered directly
from the National Archives, as Prof Witzel has pointed out. This,
however, has not worked in the past due to problems of forwarding the
required money to Nepal.
