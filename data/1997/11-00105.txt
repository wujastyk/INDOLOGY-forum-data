IE & Semitic roots. Was: Script on excavated terracotta seals              from Harappa deciphered????
Thanks to Jacob Baltuch and Dominique Thillaud for their comments.
Any opinion on where the concept of a grammatical verbal root appears first?
Also, a brief comment on the following by Jacob:
Languages can, of course, be written in any alphabet, but that may involve
the use of diacritics, or adapting certain letters (like Phoenician aleph to
Greek alpha) when the alphabet does not include all the necessary elements
(or when it has unnecessary ones).  In this sense, the writing system, as it
is used for a particular language, is closely tied to the language itself.
