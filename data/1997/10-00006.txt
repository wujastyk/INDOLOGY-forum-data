Message-ID: <161227032876.23782.15624448892393463067.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I have set up a comprehensive site on "The Bhagavad Gita", with
discourses, links and a unique FAQ. Some of the matter that is available
in this page is from postings made in this group.

There is also a new "Sloka a Day" in real audio and text format, which
will be available on this site starting Today.

I request the members to go through the site and give us any
suggestions/ comments or inputs.

Thanks

Sowmya
