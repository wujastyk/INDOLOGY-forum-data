The Bhagavad Gita site
I have set up a comprehensive site on "The Bhagavad Gita", with
discourses, links and a unique FAQ. Some of the matter that is available
in this page is from postings made in this group.
There is also a new "Sloka a Day" in real audio and text format, which
will be available on this site starting Today.
I request the members to go through the site and give us any
suggestions/ comments or inputs.
Thanks
