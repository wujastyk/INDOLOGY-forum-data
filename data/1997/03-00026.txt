Veroeffentlichungen der Uni-Halle
I am sorry! It was supposed to be a personal message addressed to an
Indologist here in Germany and by mistake landed on the list.
Yes, you got the message. I am looking for a couple of their works which 
were published for the 'first' time in 1984/1985. As you know the first 
Tamil and Telugu grammars in European languages (to be precise in Latin) 
were brought out by these two people (Schultze and Ziegenbalg).
Regards,
Sreenivas
P.S. Could someone help me in re. to my previous (German) message!
