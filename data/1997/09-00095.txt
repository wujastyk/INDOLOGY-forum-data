Dravidian Cryptography
form ofdinku, denotes: young child (DED. #1411), and Skanda or Muruga is 
knwon asan young boy, young man, a boy god; and he is associated with 
infants (AskoParpola; Deciphering the Indud Script;1994;p.225; 
henceforth I shall refer to this work as: A.Parpola).
Devarakonda Venkata Narayana Sarma says: 
form of`dinkisu' (= leap). On the other hand it is claimed that`kanda' 
which is the vikriti of `skanda' is the inverted/substituted form of 
`dinku' (= child).How can a vikriti of one word which is a 
inverted/substituted form of`dinkisu' be an inverted/ substituted form 
of another word 'dinku'. One word
I can't hunt up the exact reference here, but I do remember reading 
somewhere that "skanda" is actually from tamil "kaNDa" i.e. the argument 
was that skanda is the sansktirized form of "kaNDa" as opposed to 
"kaNDa" being a vikrti/tadbhava form of "skanda". I think that this 
theory is plausible because Murugan was originally a Dravidian diety 
i.e. ancient Tamil poetry is full of references to him but AFAIK the 
Vedas certainly donot talk about him and he appears in the rest of India 
only much later( by the time of Kalidasa, he certainly became very 
popular, but are there any copious references to him before that? I 
dobut if we'd find copious references and even then, I don't think there 
are as many as Tamil literature).
