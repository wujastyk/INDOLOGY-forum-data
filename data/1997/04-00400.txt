on vyaakaraNa-kauNDinya
Dear Members of the list,
Can you give me any information about vyaakaraNa-kauNDinya?
(e.g. his biography or texts or books reffering to him)
I think he might be a Brahmanic grammarian, but it seems that some
buddhist-texts take him to be aajJaata-kauNDinya (one of the first
disciples of Buddha).
This interests me very much.
Best Regards
