Behind Sanskrit college there's Mahabodhi Society Book Shop - books from
MLBD and others. Mailing home reliable.  Asiatic Society has sales counter
behind "New Market" in the centre
Don't miss K.L.M which is just two minutes walk from metro station Central
(or walkable distance from Skt college). It's a publisher and dealer (for
Skt college, for example) 

Sorry if too brief, I am in rush
