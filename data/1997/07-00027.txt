Can I again draw subscriber's attention to the following information.
Recently several people have got into problems as a result of not
taking heed.

The indology list will be moved within the next few weeks but it is
*not* there yet.

We are currently in the process of changing list servers from listproc to 
listserv. At 
the moment there is a shadow version of the Indology list of subscribers under 
listserv. This is there for us test various things. Therefore, at the present time
the real version of the list is the one managed by listproc. This has several consequences:

1) You need to advise potential subscribers to use the listproc address. We're 
starting to see new users trying to subscribe via listserv - this won't get them
any email at the present time.

2) Any change in subscription options need to be sent to listproc.

3) Signoff requests must go to listproc. Again, we're seeing existing members of  the 
list using the listserv address. A signoff to listserv will remove you from the
shadow but won't stop any emails.
