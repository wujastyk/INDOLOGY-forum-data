Jains and violence
Does anyone know how Jain kings / rulers handled violence? I recently
learned that a few Jains ruled in Karnataka and elsewhere over the
millennia. Given their unstinting dedication to non-violence on the one
hand and the necessity of violence in ruling and defending a kingdom on
the other, I wonder how they resolved it. Are there any Jain treatises on
raajaniiti or any descriptions of what they actually did?
