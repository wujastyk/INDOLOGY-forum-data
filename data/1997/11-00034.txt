Iyer Heritage Page
Dear S. Krishna:
Thank you for your email and encouraging words about our project.
Also thank you for the feedback - it keeps us on our toes and hungry.
I direct you to the references given at the bottom of the Iyer Heritage Page.
I am unaware of the deliberations regarding the etymology of Iyer on this
forum...
howver I have used published works as references.
This is a common misconception. The history of social migration dictates
that the first few generations of immigrants usually hold dual affiliation.
For example, are Indian Americans Indians or Americans? In the US, they are
called Indian Americans (even though they are technically Americans) and in
India they are called NRI (non resident indians).
The bigger issue would have been now whether Tyagaraja (or  TyagAYYA as he
is constantly referred to) was Iyer, but whether Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar
was Indian.
Besides, in Tyagaraja's songs, he barely praised tha Andhra country as much
as he praised the land of his birth.
Similar is the case of Govinda Dikshitar (who I am informed was  a Kannada
speaking smarta).
If S. Chandrasekhar was American, Tyagayya was Iyer and so were Govinda
Dikshitar and Radhakrishnan.
QED.
Point taken. Ill try to list the above people.
Well...I would much rather believe peer reviewd journals and the opinion of
his peers, than some pseudo sensationalist publication like Illustrated
Weekly.
As it turns out, I am at Texas A&M University, one of the top universities
in the US in agricultural research. Norman Borlaug is on our faculty. MSS
is held in high regard here among the faculty and agricultural students.

Subhaashitam: (Ancient Sanskrit Couplet)
||Kshamaa balam a-shaktaanaam; shaktaanaam bhUshaNam kshamaa|
  Kshamaa vashikrte loke, kshamayA: kim na sidhyati ? | ||
Subhashitasya anuvaadam (Translation):
Forgiveness is the strength of the weak.
Forgiveness embellishes the mighty.
In a world that can be conquered by forgiveness,
what is not possible by forgiveness?
