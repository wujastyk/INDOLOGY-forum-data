Administrative languages in India
I just had a request from a journalist regarding administrative languages of
India. May I refer the matter to the netters:
I assume that Hindi and(??) English are the administrative languages on an
all-India basis. 
Furthermore, I assume that the dominant language of the various states is
the administrative language of that state, e.g. Tamil in Tamil Nadu, Kannada
in Karnataka, Bengali in Bengal etc., possibly with English as well. 
Any hard knowledge out there?
Best regards,
