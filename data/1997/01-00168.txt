Dear INDOLOGISTS,

On request of some researchers we had recently created lists
of books on:
        1)   NYAYASUTRA and NYAYABHASYA
        2)   SAIVA SIDDHANTA
        3)   Studies on EUNUCHS IN INDIA
As the lists (1) and (2) above are quite long ones, I have not posted
them to LIST, though the researcher had asked so. Interested 
readers are requested to send an email to me so that I may send the 
same to them.

We shall have no problem in sending the paper-version, if so 
desired.

Regards,
                                            Yours sincerely
                                            Surya P. Mittal
                                            surya at pobox.com
