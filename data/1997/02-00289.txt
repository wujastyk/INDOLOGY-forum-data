German Indology
To the list members: 
I have repeatedly tried to send this to Dan Lusthaus -- using the return 
address on his message -- since it no longer has anything to do with 
Indology, but the message keeps coming back. I ask your indulgence.
I send this to you rather than to 'Indology', because the subject is getting 
out of hand.
I wasnt so sure.
Well, one can't blame him.
But, since you want to take it seriously, I have to
Certainly didn't say so. Probably very unlikely.
Perhaps Vienna's complicated relation with the USSR after the war
Yes, yes. I had eleventh grade history too. 
Sorry, I've been gone too long. It's the Foreign Relations committee. 
However, here I really do disagree. Is Helms really that different than 
Chamberlain at the turn of the century? I keep on telling people here that 
in order to understand American nationalism, one must realize that the U.S. 
is not a country, but an imperium. That is, 'Americans' (of course I 
generalize, but if one doesn't one can't say anything. Witness German[ic] 
scholarship at its worst) tend to see non-Americans as would-be Americans 
who perhaps don't yet speak English. And please, please, don't tell me that 
of late America has become used to different 'traditions': this just ain't 
so. When I was growing up in L.A., the 'Nisei' around the corner ate more 
rice, the 'Italians' ate more pasta and everybody scarfed tacos, but that 
was about the extant of the difference. In fact, I am conservative enough 
that I don't think that is a Bad Thing, but cultural sensitivity, nah. 
'educated classes' have become relatively internationalized and that the 
majority who are not, resent it. If I may make a comparison, I think we're 
in the 1840's or so. The nasty aspects of the Industrial Revolution are 
plain and obvious to everyone: the nice things have yet to appear. We'll see.
