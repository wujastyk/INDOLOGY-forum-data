Many schools of Dance express the themes contained within the GG. Please
check the repertoire of Odissi and Kathak dance forms. I am sorry, I do
not have additional information. You may call upon the Odissi dance shcool
which is organized by guru Kelucharan Mohapatra for details to see if
textual studies are/ were part of the preparation for the art performance. 
Also check the various arts organizations affiliated with the Government
of India such as All India Radio based in Delhi and other programs related
with Dilli Doordarshan. Goodluck.
