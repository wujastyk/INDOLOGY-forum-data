As a lifelong Australian, I also cannot recall ever hearing the expression
'layback': perhaps its because I've never frequented happy hours. A random
guess would be that it refers to the habit of imbibing an alcoholic drink
poured directly into the mouth by another person whilst one lies flat on
ones back, but I didnt think that this was a characteristic Australian
drinking game.
Ah well, its seven and a half hours till happy hour at the Uni bar.
