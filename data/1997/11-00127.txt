Jain Mahabharatas
Dear Yigal,
You might try contacting Prof. Phyllis Granoff in the Dept. of Religious
Studies at McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada L8S 4K1. She is
very well versed in Jaina literary traditions. I don't have an e-mail
address for her, but you could try phoning the Department at (905) 525-9140
ext. 23109 or faxing Prof. Granoff at (905) 525-8161.
Hope this helps.
Regards,
Joel Tatelman.
