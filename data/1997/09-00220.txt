What you say seems logical at first

Inside CilappatikAram, viLari is (but for one exception)
the sixth note.
Some new theory might have used terms which were already current.
Coming to the identification of viLari in terms of modern rAga-s,
S.Ramanathan says (Music in Cilappatikaaram, p. 21) that the notes
of viLarippaalai are (sa, ri-1, ga-1, ma-1, ma-2, dha-1, ni-1)
(This is deduced from a Zodiac explaination). He concludes
that: "It skips the pancama but takes both varieties
of madhyama. There is no corresponding
raaga in South Indian music."
However, later (on page 42),  he associates tODi
with the paN "cevvazhiyaazh" and the paalai "cevvazhi".
So, some mystery remains.
