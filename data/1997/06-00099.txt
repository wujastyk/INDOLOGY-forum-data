ATalpaRRu (VEnkata Narayana Sarma)
Hello,
thank you very much for your information.
In this case, though, ATalpaRRu refers to adaptations of classical 
(Tamil) texts for the use in "kUttu", i.e. "plays" (in different forms). 
In this very special case, it seems to refer mainly to adaptations of 
KambarAmAyaNa for shadow-puppet-plays (in Central Kerala - that is at 
least, what is given in a remark on one manuscript I have with me ...)
"ATalpaRRu" seems to be a general term for that specific genre of 
folk-literature. - Sorry I was so less explicit in my query: but most of 
the facts given here I learnt by and by after I had sent my query.
Still, I am searching for bibliographical references on theses type of 
texts: has something been written *ABOUT* this genre? Or, are printed 
editions available?
Greetings, ULRIKE
