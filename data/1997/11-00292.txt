>Dear Chris,
>
>The new, searchable INDOLOGY archive is fantastic, and an extremely
>substantial enhancement of the INDOLOGY list.  I should like to thank you
>and Alan heartily for the new developments.
>
>I strongly urge INDOLOGY members to explore the new facilities that the
>Liverpool team have provided.  You may find that this new web-based
>interface may become your main way of interacting with the INDOLOGY list.
>
>The archives are completely up-to-date, fully searchable, indexed in
>several ways, and the internet links and addresses cited in messages are
>all clickable.
>
>Once again, I should like to thank Chris Wooff and Alan Thew, and the
>University of Liverpool, for their generous support over hte years for
>this discussion forum.  I think it is not an exaggeration to say that for
>those who have used it seriously, INDOLOGY has contributed significantly
>to the academic and professional environment in which we conduct our work.
>
>All the best,
>Dominik
