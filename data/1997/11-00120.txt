Tamil's contribution to Paninian grammatical tradition
Some articles regarding South India and Buddhism appear
once in a while in the "Journal of the Institute of Asian studies",
Madras. The authors are from India, Japan & elsewhere.
David Shulman once told me that Telugu literature retains many things
to do with meditation. A vestige of Buddhism. This is hard to find
in Tamil. For example, few of Annamayya's krithis on Tirupati Venkatesvara
is about meditation, he informed me.
