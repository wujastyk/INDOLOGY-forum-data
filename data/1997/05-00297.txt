Internet access to the British Library Catalogue
You can now get free internet access to the British Library Catalogue. The 
service was launched last week (remote access was previously available only 
by subscription to BLAISE). The address is:
     http://opac97.bl.uk
I do not need to stress the value of this new service for indologists. The
British Library includes the collections of the former British Museum and
the India Office Library and Records.  Until 1947 the BM and IOLR received
(in theory) one copy of every book published in India. 
Opac97 - as it's known - covers the following: 
- Original BL catalogue (c.1450-1975) and its successors.
- Humanities & social sciences and the Science Reference and Information
  Service. 
- Boston Spa: Document Supply Centre holdings of books and reports from
  1980; conference proceedings form 1964; journals from 1700. 
A link will shortly be added to the INDOLOGY libraries page.
All the best,
