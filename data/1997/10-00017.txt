In the Gita Press edition of Chandogya Upanishad the text is given as

        "tAni ha vA EtAni trINyakSarANi satIyamiti...."

Sankara comments

        "...trINyEtani satIyamiti sakArastakArO yamiticha. IkArastakAra uchchA-
raNArthO~nubandhah. hrasvEnaivAkSarENa punah pratinirdEzAt."

I am not able to locate the form sattiyam. Can you
please be more specific about the location.
