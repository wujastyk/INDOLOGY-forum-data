Nyayabhashya encoding (fwd)
Many thanks indeed to Dmitry at quant.stu.neva.ru who has kindly donated
the first 25 Nyayasutras together with bhasya to the INDOLOGY Virtual
e-text Archive.  The files are available as of now under the name
  nyayabhasya.zip
  nyayabhasya.readme
The zip file contains the text and TrueType fonts for display.
Dmitry says that more of the text is coming in the near future.
All the best, and thank you again, Dmitry, for your generosity in making 
this material available.
Dominik
