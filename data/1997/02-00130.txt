Help with font packages.
Hello all,
A few days ago Mr. Wujastyk stated that he would no longer be able to
provide assistance in regards to fonts and font packages. I would first
like to thank him for the help that he has provided to others and to me,
and would secondly like to mention that I may be contacted for assistance
in this this matter if requested. Although my expertise cannot come close
to matching that of Mr. Wujastyk's, I hope that in spite of this I could
be of some service.
Regards,
Anshuman Pandey
