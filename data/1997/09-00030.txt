Q: mArjArahatyA
Dear Bob:
About your story of the cat, I do not have a classic reference. However, as
a child growing up in India, we were told not to bother a cat. If one does
bother it then one has to pay a golden hair for every hair that is damaged.
I think this may be said to support the idea of AHINSA (not hurting any
living being).
Jay.
P.S. Interesting to know thatU of manitoba has studies in Indology. I
graduated from this university in 1973(biochemistry).
