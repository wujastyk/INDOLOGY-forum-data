- the verb: zaMs- is known to exprime the praise and the reinforcement
caused by it; this reinforcement cause gifts for the worshipper (pra is
prospective).
- who is praised: mother of mRgas, the One of the araNya; araNya is the

	I believe the main problem is to keep the two meanings,
- Celestial Cow as the Earth, with flowers (colour and fragrance),
producing fruits without labour.
- Celestial Cow as a woman, with make-up and perfume, fertile but virgin.
	I suppose I could do it in French but my English is poor. I can try:
Ornate and perfumed, be the Shine of the Gods,
fertile without husband,
I praise you up for this, savage Lady of the Beasts!
	But I confess I have used my knowledge of the greek Goddess Artemis.
