                                                for community leaders
Dear Community Leaders:
SALTA invites you and your fellow community leaders to a workshop on the
teaching and learning of heritage languages in a community setting. For all
those who are engaged in organizing or teaching heritage languages to the
next generation, SALTA has taken the initiative in coordinating a special
session for sharing professional expertise and discuss the ways and means
to alleviate some of the problems faced.
The workshop is geared to provide insights how language works, successful
stratagies for learning a language and for language instruction. We will
also distribute information about the availability of language materials
and the use of Internet for language learning and language teaching. This
workshop is an effort in initiating a new process of equipping our
community leaders with effective tools of education so that the benefit
from our endeavors is maximized.
The workshop is open to every one interested in learning and teaching of an
Indian/South Asian language whether in a community school or in one's own
home.
The workshop is free. Those who are interested in attending the workshop
are required to complete the enclosed form and send it by March 3. The
seats are limited and hence early application is advised.
