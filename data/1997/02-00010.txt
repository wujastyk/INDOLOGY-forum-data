Complete Works of Aurobindo
I received today a mailing that contained this paragraph:
"A new set of the complete works of Sri Aurobindo in a uniform library
edition of 35 volumes 9.5 x 6.5 inches printed on acid-free paper will be
published and mailed over the next five years. It will contain 2500
additional pages of texts and revisions not included in the 1972 _Sri
Aurobindo Birth Centernary Library._ A special prepublication price of $400
(postpaid) is available if a check for the full amount is sent payable to
SABDA, Sri Aurobindo Ashram, Pondicherry 605 002 India by February 21st.
After this date, the price will be substantially higher."
