      Q: Saskia Kersenboom's address
      ******************************
Can someone give Dr. Kersenboom-Story's address? This was a query
by D. Soneji too. I am reading her recent work.

Another person to contact for Telugu studies is the

on Tamil Padhams and has given some important Telugu padhams
to translators of the book: "When God is a Customer: Telugu
cortesan songs". His e-mail: matallen at uoknor.edu
