Perhaps an entrance exam?  (joke)
When INDOLOGY started, for quite a while it had about 3--50 members,
and although there was never a k.rta yuga, the discussion was less
elementary, I seem to recall.  Now there are 600 members, and as we all
know "big is different".  It is inevitable that the character of the forum
has changed.  But I remain unwilling to engage in heavy editorial work,
and no alternative is obvious to me.
Perhaps we need simply to attend to what is interesting and valuable, and
rapidly delete the rest?  The use of local tools like Procmail can help to
filter out topics and correspondents we are not interested in.
All the best,
