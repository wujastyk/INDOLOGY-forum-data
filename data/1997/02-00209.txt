An Exciting New Development
It may be interesting to note, that the Samskrita Bharati page at
http://rbhatnagar.ececs.uc.edu:8080/sanskrit/mlist.html
is using a similar system. They too offer a downloadable Devanagari font, by installing which their daily Sanskrit lessons can be directly viewed in Devanagari in the Web-browser.
