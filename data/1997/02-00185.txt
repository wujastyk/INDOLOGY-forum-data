In addition to the recently cited reference by Dr. Enrica Garzilli, there is
some interesting earlier work, perhaps along similar lines but starting from
an anthropological fieldwork perspective, by Lawrence A. Babb in his _The
Divine Hierarchy: Popular Hinduism in Central India_ (New York: Columbia
University Press, 1975) and, developed in a psychoanalytic direction, by
Stanley W. Kurtz in _All the Mothers are One_ (New York: Columbia University
Press, 1992).  [Possible they have something of an unintended non-dravidian
bias.]

In any case, my own view is that all this is an unfortunate Indoeuropean
quirk. :-)
