Dear Klemens!
I can recommend to begin with looking at the bookshops on College Street,
that's opposite the university.
Sanskrit Pustak Bhandar, 38 Bidhan Sarani (that's an extension of College
Street) is specialised in Sanskrit literature etc. unfortunately a little
bit unorganized and slow in service.
anyhow there are lots of other bookstores with a big scope of regular
Sanskrit related literature and other interesting stuff.
on College Street You'll also find a store of Rupa publishers.
inside the Great Eastern Hotel on Old Court House Street (south of BBD Bagh)
is Newman's.
on Park Street You'll find The Cambridge Book & Stationary Company and
further down the Oxford Book Shop.
if You're interested in Vedanta literature it's definitely worth to drop
into the Ramakrishna Mission, Institute of Culture, at Golpark.
in the end of january there's also one of India's biggest book fairs on the
Maidan.
hope you'll enjoy Your trip.
best wishes
tobias
