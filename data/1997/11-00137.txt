Looking for hindu temples in USA
Diana Eck's impressive CD-ROM ("On Common Ground") has a directory of about
300 Hindu institutions in USA.  This is the most complete list that I know
of and includes temples, ashrams, meditation centers etc.  I recommend you
look at this CE-ROM first.  It's a great resource to have.
You can also find links to 30-35 temple home pages at the following "meta"
sites.
NY-Flushing temple:
http://www.indianet.com/ganesh/-- The "temples online" here will connect you
to about 31-32 temples in USA and Canada (one UK)
The "Temples on Net" page
http://rbhatnagar.ececs.uc.edu:8080/temple_info/temple_homes.html. Connects
with 31 temples -- most of them are found in the Ganesha temple page.
Contact me if you want addresses of the newer temples not on these lists.
