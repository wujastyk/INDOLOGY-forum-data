	There are also some other books , especially by Eric von
	Daniken. But he makes passing mention about them.

		There are many referances. But work into this field has 
	not been in depth.
		 Some Pauraanic details even reveal the application
	Lorentz's Equation.
		 Wish you luck.
	The "Samaraangana Suutra Dhaara" has been published in
	"Gaekwad's Oriental Studies" 1924, Baroda.
