(Fwd) query: Gita tapes
Honorable Pandits & Indologists,
I just received the appended inquiry from a friend.  Might I impose 
upon this august body to the extent of seeking info on audio-sloka 
sources (specifically, Bhagavad Gita) for sake of my correspondent?
You might wish to respond backchannel (to me and/or Kendra) -- unless 
this might perhaps be felt to be of general (listproc) interest.
thanks, d.i.
      query: Gita tapes
Hi, David. Would you know where I could find out about audio tape
recordings of the Bhagavad Gita? My sister (who studies Sanskrit) is
looking for something with a real Indian pandit reading (or chanting)
in Sanskrit, with no musical background. She already has tapes from
the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi people and by someone named Houston, and a
Folkways recording. Wants to know of others. Know where could I
research this (on the internet)?
