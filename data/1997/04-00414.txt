problems with sanskrit font...
Hi
I am trying to typeset a page in TeX with with some sanskrit text on
it using Charles Wikner's sanskrit package.  However, although I am
certain I got the entire package (fonts/sanskrit.gz), dvips gives me
the following error about a missing file skt10.  Any help in solving
this urgent problem would be greatly appreciated.
Many thanks in advance.
