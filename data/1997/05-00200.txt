If there is one number that can be called the mystical number
supreme in India, it is SUnya = 0.  Whole philosophies
in Buddhism, Tantric Hinduism, Jainism, etc. are constructed
around this number and concept.  At the recent Seminar on SUnya
(Feb. 97) held by INSA and IGNCA in New Delhi,  the topic was
explored in depth and many interesting papers were presented.
