RV 8.43.11 and beef-eating
Thompson has replied at length to my posting on ukSAnna and vaZAnna. He appears
to be right when he says:
Perhaps I may refer to AtharvaVeda 10.10, a long sukta dedicated to
to the vaZA cow(rsi:kaSyapa):
In the very first stanza it is declared
" namaste .......aghnye te namaha" (AV 10.10.1)
The vaZA cow is a special cow , and it is inviolable.
Far from not giving milk,
"vaZAm sahasradhArAm..........AvadAmasi" (AV 10.10.4)
we praise the vaZA cow which gives milk in a thousand streams..
"Zatam kamsAha Zatam dogdhArAha zatam goptAro..." (AV 10.10.5)
for the vaZA cow, a hundred keepers and a hundred milkers stand ready with a
hundred milk vessels.. (pardon my mistakes in transliteration, I forgot the
 Harvard scheme).
"vaZAya dugdhamapibatsAdhyAha...."(AV 10.10.30)
The sAdhyAs and...... drink in yajna the milk which the vaZA yields.
Apparently, it has taken decades to convince some that vaZA does not mean
sterile, barren. It may take even more time to convince that vaZA yields milk,,
and that it is a special cow. Very few people are blessed with the possession
of such a cow. But to say that it is a prime candidate for sacrifice and food
is to deny what the veda itself declares:vaZA is aghnyA, it yields copious
milk, it does get pregnant(yes; AV10.10.23), but people are frightened when
this happens. The vaZA cow loves those who offer its products in yajna.
Hats off to Thompson when he says:
And then Thompson says:
But, ukSA=soma is literal and "vaZAyAstat priyam yaddevatrA havih syAt"
