        In the case of 'to yes', Benveniste give a reference at: Mencken,
The American language, p.195.

        Despite Benveniste advice, I don't believe this two verbs beeing
delocutives. 'tutoyer', with the reduplication 'tu' + 'toi' seems a
formation parallel to the expression 'etre a tu et a toi avec quelqu'un'.
It covers the two cases 'sujet' and 'regime' of the ancient French, two
forms unable to be in the same elocution. Hence, it is more
'demorphological' (!?!) than delocutive. 'vouvoyer' or 'voussoyer' are
formed by analogy.

        Sorry for this small non-Indological parenthesis.

PS: George, I'm yet trained to write free-mindly my poor English, that's no
more an ordeal ;-)
