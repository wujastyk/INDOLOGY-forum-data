Subject: Etymology of 'tanU'

The following may be of interest to those interested in exploring the issue
of  tan2/tAn2 in Dravidian and tanU in IA. The Sanskrit grammatical terms
'Atmanepada' and 'parasmaipada' have parallels in Tamil as 'tan2vin2ai' and
'piRavin2ai' although there is no one-to-one correspondence between the two
groups. The term 'tan2vin2ai' occurs in TolkAppiyam. A discussion of these
categories can be found in Dr. K. Paramasivan's book Effectivity and
Causativity in Tamil.
