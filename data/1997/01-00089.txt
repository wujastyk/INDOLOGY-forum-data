Book Review: ANCIENT CHOLISTAN - Archaeology and Architecture
(A copy of this message has also been posted to the following newsgroups:
sci.archaeology)
Reposting from soc.culture.pakistan.history.
While the following is, patently, a puff piece, and regrettably
uninformative about the book itself (I really wish I could tell whether
this was the truly-at-last full report on Mughal's explorations, or simply
a book about them), the comments on Mughal's work are essentially
unexaggerated, and come from the most respected scholars.
I'll be looking for this book.
