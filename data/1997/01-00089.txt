Reposting from soc.culture.pakistan.history.

While the following is, patently, a puff piece, and regrettably
uninformative about the book itself (I really wish I could tell whether
this was the truly-at-last full report on Mughal's explorations, or simply
a book about them), the comments on Mughal's work are essentially
unexaggerated, and come from the most respected scholars.

I'll be looking for this book.

>    "This book is a  splendid  report  on   the   pioneering  archaeological
>    research  undertaken  by  Dr.  M.  Rafique   Mughal  in  Cholistan.  His
>    discoveries along the Hakra River have  revolutionized our understanding
>    of the Harappan Civilization. Dr.  Mughal's  contribution to South Asian
>    archaeology ranks with those of  Sir  John Marshall, Ernest J. H. Mackay
>    and M. S. Vats  and  their  excavations  of  Mohenjo-Daro  and  Harappa.
>    Rafique Mughal is our modern day Sir Aurel Stein".
