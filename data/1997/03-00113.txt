Sarasvati river and spelling mistake
Oh for my English spelling! Why didn't Bernard Shaw carry his reform through?
Sorry twice!! The correct spelling should be: aquifers.
How come it is aqueduct, not aqui-?
I think I should have a small pocket Oxford English dictionary close by,
in addition to my bulky 25+ indian language dictionaries... 
I should thank my friends for pointing out my misspelling with such good cheer.
Cheers.
