Silk in Benares
Does anyone know at what time silk began to be made in Benares (if ever
- could that famous stuff be imported?) and what the textual evidence
is?
Any information on silk in Benares (though I must make it very clear I
do not want to come and see your shop, not even for just looking) is
welcome.
Many thanks
