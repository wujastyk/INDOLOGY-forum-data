        It seems you can perhaps add the great asura varuNa to your corpus
(even if, as me, you're not a metathesis' fan), but *avRNa would be a
strange word and the initial 'a' a bit puzzling in Sanskrit ('A' would be
easier); and I'm unable to find any good Eurindian correspondance (the
Roman gens Aurelia comes probably from an *ausel ~ uSas; the Greek hydronym
Auras, Danube's tributary, is very far).
