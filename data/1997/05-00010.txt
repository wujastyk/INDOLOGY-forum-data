In the Hindu folklore,

1. Are there REVERSED FEET fairies?

2. Are there ONE-EYED GIANTS?

3. Are the following products considered polluting: DOMESTIC FOWLS,
   ONIONS, GARLIC, AND THE SCARLET DYESTUFF rhoi?

4. Can the FAIRIES control the weather and cause storms? In the
   MOUNTAINS ARE THERE LAKES WHERE THEY ARE SAID TO BATHE?  Will throwing
   rocks into one of these lakes CAUSE RAIN OR HAIL?

5. Is there a belief that the exploitation of domestic animals
   (specifically goats) is merely the terrestial parrallel to the HERDING
   OF IBEXES AND MOUNTAIN GOATS BY THE FAIRIES in their high mountain
   domain? Futhermore, CAN ONE ONLY KILL ANIMALS WHICH HAVE ALREADY BEEN
   EATEN BY THE FAIRIES?

6. Any other beliefs associated with high altitude with low lands?
