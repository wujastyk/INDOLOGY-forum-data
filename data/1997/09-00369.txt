Emacs + devanagari

The Devanagari implementation on Emacs 20.2 still has some bugs in
treatment of avagraha and vocalic r. The implementor privately
informed me that this will be fixed in the next release (i.e.,
ver. 20.3).  It seems that the patch to fix this problem has already
been sent to Richard Stallman, the maintainer of GNU Emacs.
As the re-installation process of Emacs is a somewhat tedious task, it
would be better to wait the next version.
(I myself am the implementor of the Tibetan language support on GNU
Emacs 20. I will be glad if the users send me comments about my
Tibetan implementation.)
