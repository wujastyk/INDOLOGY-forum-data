My own textbooks thru high school used Devanagari characters (the
language was Marathi). I imagine, Hindi texts used to be similar!
Some time in the 70's the textbooks seem to have adopted the roman
numerals as the norm for all books regardless of the language.

As far as the signs are concerned, I have not seen any other kind
besides the "western" type. In "classical" books, either there are no
symbols used, or the symbols used in modern commentaries are the
usual "western" kind.
