beef eating in RV 8.43.11
Beatrice,
There are three problems with saying this:
1. there are also [virile, young] bulls
2.  vaZA' cows are strictly "non-pregnant" rather than "old, barren" [cf.
Falk, Jamison]
3.  both are explicitly "food"
So, I take the passage to be a little ambiguous [i.e., metaphorical],
admittedly, but about "beef-eating" in some sense.
George
