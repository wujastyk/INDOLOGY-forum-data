Kane also mentions the Asokan rock edicts (1, 2 and 4), although it always
struck me that the animals Asoka decided to protect were the more exotic
ones (how many people were eating porcupines anyway?); someone on the list
undoubtedly is more familiar with the edicts and can say whether Asoka
banned beef.
       and it is spoken about as a matter of common knowledge that needs no
       adduced in support of this Jaina claim.
The Tamil Jain work Niilakeeci includes several lengthy attacks on Buddhist
meat-eaters.  There is also the Sanskrit Mattavilaasaprahasanam, attributed
to Mahendravarman (c. 7th century CE), which involves a fight between a
KapaaLin and a Buddhist monk -- the KapaaLin accuses the monk of stealing
an alms bowl full of meat. I would be interested in hearing more about the
Kannada works.
