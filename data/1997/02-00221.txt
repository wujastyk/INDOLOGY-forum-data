Perhaps I am not the only one to say this (I haven't checked through all my
backed-up email today), but I fear that to me anyway Indo-Germanic (in
English or in German) indeed sounds nationalistic.  If one wanted a
technically defensible name, would we not have to resort to something like
Tocharo-Hittite?
