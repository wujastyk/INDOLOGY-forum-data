===========================================
Yes similar tradition is prevelant in other parts as well. 

In Andhra Pradesh, it is observed on Kaartika Paurnami (The women perform some rituals and then lit lamps which are floated in river waters -- "Kaartika Deepam".). The purpose is the same : praying for the longevity of their husbands.

In north India, this is celebrated as "Karua Chauth". The rituals are somewhat similar.

I am not sure about the time when this festival is observed. Of course keeping a fast on the day is a common practice for the women.
