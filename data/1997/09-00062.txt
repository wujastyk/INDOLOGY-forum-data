Imperfection of Western Indology (pace Fosse)
Dr. Silk (whose name mighe recollect the jovial jibe leveled at 
that it's comparable to a strand of silk so subtle anad find that 
perhaps it escapes materiality or likely even existence entirely), 
allows:
comparative consideration of Sinology will recollect not only 
Zhuang-ze [Ch'uang Tse]'s "uncarved block," more even more 
aptly, the venerable Lao-ze [Lao Tse]'s crucial adage:
    wei wu-wei
    er wu bu wei
  "[if you can but] do the no-doing
   [yo!] there's nothin' that ain't done!"
cheers,
d.i.
