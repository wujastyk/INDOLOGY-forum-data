and should not decide the matter. From the Buddhist or the Vedantic
perspectives, the only "karmic" consequences will result from the choices
that we human beings make, and the level of avidyA that dictates such
choices.
Such an argument seems to create a rather artificial distinction between
"life" and "soul" in the first place. One could argue that nothing without
a "soul" can "live", so that by definition, it is the soul that causes an
entity to live (in whatever sense you understand these two terms). 
Secondly, life cannot be "artifically created", at least not yet. Although
nucleic acids, proteins and cell wall components can all be individually
synthesized in the laboratory, scientists have not been able to put
together even the simplest unicellular organism, starting from 
artificially synthesized chemicals. Frankenstein monsters, computers with
free will and self-reproducing robots exist only in fiction. The hard fact
is that cloning, as much as sex, can only "create" new life from
pre-existing life.

As a scientist with an abiding interest in philosophy, I sharply disagree
with the above statement. Science has nothing to say about when a soul
comes into being and when it passes into non-being, nor whether it comes
into being at all, nor whether something called soul even exists. That is
the province of metaphysics/religion/philosophy, call it what you will.
Some RELIGIONS say that a soul comes into being, other RELIGIONS say that
the soul is eternal, and some RELIGIONS deny that the soul exists. Science
(and the so-called scientific method) simply do not have the means to
decide in favor of one vs. the others. 
Calling something a "scientific fact" does not invest it with any 
more or any less certitude than other kinds of fact. For that matter,
there is no fact that is "scientific" in itself, and no fact that is "not
scientific" in itself. What science does is to give you hypotheses,
theories and conclusions, which explain the observed facts. These theories
then make predictions, which can be verified or refuted. The verification
of a prediction does not make it a scientific fact; on the other hand,
what makes scientists accept a given theory is the degree to which a
prediction made by that theory succeeds in explaining experimental
results. A theory that does not make satisfactory predictions or one that
makes wrong predictions is rejected. In any case, what is "scientific" is
the theory, the explanation, the prediction; not the facts themselves.
The statements, 
	1. the soul does not exist, 
	2. souls come into being and
	3. souls are eternal 
are all equivalent, or should be, as far as scientists are concerned,
because none of these can be either verified or refuted according to the
scientist's way of thinking. They are of the same category as the
statements, "God exists" and "God does not exist". These kinds of
statements cannot be subjected to scientific examination and proof. As a
result, these notions about the soul are facts or not facts according to
your religious sensibilities, they are not scientific (not that any fact
could ever be "scientific"). Don't expect science (or scientists) to
bolster or weaken any of these notions. 
You're right about language being required for thinking. And if any decent
thinking on the topic of cloning is ever to develop, we had better be
careful about the language we use, and not define things arbitrarily. 
Again, debatable. If you were to talk to advaitins, they would say that it
is ultimately meaningless to talk of the "own will" of the Atman. 
This is just one step away from Descartes' argument about human beings
having souls. Are you saying that the sparrow on the tree does not have a
soul, but your parrot Polly has a soul, just because you gave her a name? 
If it were that easy to define soul as you do, the soul's existence is
based on a whim, and is effectively removed both from the domain of 
science and the domain of religion. Are you sure that is such a good
thing?
