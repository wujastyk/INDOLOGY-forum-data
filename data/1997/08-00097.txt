faith in Hinduism
A delayed response to the recent question about faith. Yoshitsugu Sawai
has written a book titled The Faith of Ascetics and Lay Smartas, focussing
on the advaita sannyasin tradition, discussed in light of W. C. Smith's
definition of faith. He discusses the emphasis on SraddhA and bhakti in
the contemporary advaita tradition very well.
