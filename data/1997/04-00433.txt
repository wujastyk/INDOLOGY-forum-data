It seems that you HAVE to type a virama to make a consonent appear in its
partial form. Wouldn't it be better just to type a conjunct consonent and
have the computer figure out which consonents appear in partial form and
which do not? So instead of typing 's(v)t(v)r' where (v) is whatever
character Apple uses to type a virama (or halant as they call it), just type
'str'. Is there some cultural reason why viramas must be typed?
