Aeronautics in Ancient India?
Pranaam,
I am looking for information on aeronautics in ancient 
India. I am told that there is a book called Brihat Vimana 
Samahita in Sanskrit. I am looking for more information on this 
subject. Can someone throw light on any Sanskrit literature (or 
English Translations of any Sanskrit treatise) in this area of 
study.
I hear that in the year 1911, a device based on this oral tradition was 
constructed and was flown at Mumbai Chowpatty in the presence of many 
people, including Lokmanya Tilak. This was reported in the Tarun Bharat 
Newspaper.
Could the legend of the Pushpak Vimana mentioned in the Ramayana be 
based on some factual device made
and  used in ancient India?
Subham~astu
