I have a friend who would like to acquire a book dealing with medical
diagnosis and treatment in Sanskrit and/or Tibetan.

The book would included Tibetan/Sanskrit original with english translation,
perhaps by CandrAnada or rGyu-Zhi or with commentaries by the same.

She already is familar with

Author: Vogel, Klaus
Title: Astangahrdayasamhita: the first five chapters of its tibetan version ...
Place of Publication: Wiesbaden
Publisher: Franz Steiner
Publication Date: 1965


She is especially interested in any text of this ilk that discusses pulses
and their diagnosis.

Could anyone help me with this?

Thanks in advance

David Dargie
