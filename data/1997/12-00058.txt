Graha epithets
I agree with  D V N Sarma (Dec 3, 1997) that the most likely meaning of
Taarakaagrahataaraka  for Ketu is something like 'a planet which seizes
other planets.'
We are in an  astronomical/astrological context.     So we expect
taaraka-aagraha-taaraka, rather than Taarakaa-graha-taaraka.
