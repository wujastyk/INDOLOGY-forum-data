Subject: Horses in India, onagers too
Message-ID: <161227027821.23782.7726174890729403019.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I have another question about equid breeding in India:
Clutton-Brock's ``Horse Power'' states that breeding of crosses
between donkeys/horses and the Indian onager (Equus hemiones (sp?) khur)
was a `regular' occurance. Is there any information on how far
back this practice extended? [To judge by the Sanskrit dictionaries,
Sanskrit literature does not seem to distinguish between donkeys
and onagers. Is this correct, or is it simply a matter of translators
missing the distinction?]

There are feral horses in the American southwest and Arabs must not have
had any problems breeding horses. Unless the monsoon interferes with
horses' mating habits, I don't see how climate can affect breeding
horses.
