	Dear Indologists,

	In Sanskrit many plants have a name linked with the frog:
bhekaparNI (?), maNDukaparNa (Calosanthes indica) and darduraparNI who is
said the same as the plant brAhmI (Clerodendrum siphonantus, Ruta
graveolens, Enhydra hingcha).
	My question are: what is the common feature of this various plants
? form of the leaves ? growing in water ? the name brAhmI is given too as
the name of a she-frog, how this zakti can be a plant or a frog ? Can I
find an itihAsa who explain it ? There is any rapport with RV,7,103 ?
	(all my references are from MMW s.v.)

	Regards,
Dominique
