Dear Indologists:
Thanksfor the references on comparing Indian and Greek Epics. I have go
t my interlibrary loan person working! On the bow comparison, Prof.
Thillaud is quite correct to say there is no real connection between
Odysseus' bow and SHiva's, nor did I intend any. It was merely the spur
to my idea to investigate the matter. Again, I really appreciate the
quick response to my question. You have all been very helpful to me in
my work on the philosophy of history. Randy Groves
