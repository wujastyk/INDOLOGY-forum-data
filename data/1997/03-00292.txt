In response to a message from mgansten at sbbs.se (Martin Gansten),
I would like to mention that the parallax "correction" is taken into
account in Jyotish although many practitioners do not employ it. For example.
according to one set of calculations, for the position of the Moon at
10Tula29 without a factor for parallax, it is 9Tula51 otherwise.
