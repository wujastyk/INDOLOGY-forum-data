Pata;njali-carita has been published in the Kaavya-maalaa Series of the
Nirnaya-sagara Press at least twice. Recently, there has been a reprint of
the whole series (from Munshiram Manoharlal, Delhi?),I understand. I have
not seen all the vols.

I have a photocopy of the second  Nirnaya-sagara edn, Kaavya-maalaa no. 51,
printed in 1934.

The text does talk about Gaudapada, Govinda, and Sankara toward its conclusion.

I have discussed the main narrative of the text   in the unpublished fourth
installment of my series of articles titled "Interpreting Vaakyapadiiya
2.486 historically."
