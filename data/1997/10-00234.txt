Hello,

There is a discussion on the conv-dev list in regard to the
transliteration of the Marathi repha depending on its contexts. I'm
forwarding the message to this list in case anyone is able to address
the question. Please send your responses to conv-dev at elot.gr

Thank you.

Regards,
Anshuman Pandey

Subject: Marathi repha

Dear Colleagues

Marathi has two forms of repha (r initial in a cluster): the usual
non-spacing  form (call it R for now), and a spacing form with a flattish
breve shape under the top line (call it R' for now).    The ALA-LC
Romanization Tables take no notice of R'.

In order to discuss whether R' requires a separate transliteration, it
would be especially  helpful to have answers to the following questions:
---
Taking the Marathi words involving repha -

(1) Are there some words in which there is a choice between using R' and
using R ?

IF the answer to question (1) is Yes, then:

(2) How is this choice made?

(3) Are there some words in which only R may be used ?

(4) Are there some words in which only R' may be used ?
---
(The answers to these questions determine how the different sets of words
are related.)

I look forward to seeing your responses.

Thanks,   Tony
