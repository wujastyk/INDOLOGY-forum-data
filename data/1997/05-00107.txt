Nag Panchami
An acquaintance of mine, not on the list, is planning a first visit to
India this summer and would like advice on places she might observe
celebrations of Nag Pachami, supposedly on August 8th this year.
Any suggestions, including references to published sources on the subject
will be much appreciated and duly forwarded.
Thanks,
