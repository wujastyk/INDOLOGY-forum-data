In an earlier response to B. Reusch's inquiry, I mentioned that I wou
ld try
to get from my university's library the particulars of a relevant boo
k. I
now have the particulars. The book, written in excellent
scholarly/Sanskritic Hindi, does not have much on accent (it is spars
e on
the phonetic aspect in general) but is a mine of information on lexic
al,
morphological etc. continuities between Punjabi and Sanskrit (standin
g
frequently for Vedic / Vedic Sanskrit).

The book also discusses the relationship between Punjabi and Sanskrit

literatures.

The details are: Dr. Syama Deva Parasara [= ;syaama deva paaraa;sara]
