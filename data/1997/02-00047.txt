Ganesan, I came across these in our library catalog
while looking for something else...  the first title,
intriguingly,  has the word navarasa in it... but I

I also remember seeing a section on laments, elegies,
in a book of Tamil nATTuppATalkal (country/folk songs)...
But there are too many of those books in our library 
catalog to list here !
