Dravidian Cryptography
Since Mr Kumar has shown himself in his numerous postings to be a
comparatist, it occurred to me that he might find the following references
useful. There is in fact a long history, both fruitful and fruitless, of
what he calls cryptography in Europan history, going back of course to
Plato [Europeans like to say that it *all* goes back to Plato; we
Indologists know better]. For the convenience of the reader I will make
reference only to Englsh language books [other references can be forwarded
off-list, on request].
Of course there have been countless cryptographies based on the collection
of writings conveniently known now as the Bible. The most recent one in
English in fact is currently on the best-seller lists. It is called,
appropriately enough, _The Bible Code_. It uses computers. Impressive.
Just by coincidence [I imagine], I have here on my desk a book called _The
Wolf Man's Magic Word: A Cryptonymy_, by Nicolas Abraham & Maria Torok
[foreward by Jacques Derrida], Minneapolis, 1986. For those interested in
Freudian and neo-Freudian crytography. Five stars.
_The Violence of Language_, by Jean-Jacques Lecercle, London, 1990. This
book presents the author's revolutionary "theory of the remainder" whereby
speakers overcome the violent constraints imposed on them by their native
languages. The remainder is what your grammar book leaves out. It is the
"odd, untidy, awkward, creative part" of language. It is the "essence of
poetry and of metaphor". Etc. A weird and fascinating book. It is supposed
by some to have original insights into the origins of language. Highly
recommended for those interested in origins.
_The Power of Babel: A Study of Logophilia_, by Michel Pierssens, London,
1980. This is a brief history of five "logophiles" who were engaged in
research rather like Mr. Kumar's, except in various European languages.
Unfortunately some of them were schizophrenics, while others were a poet, a
novelist, or a linguist. Top notch reading. Unfortunately it lacks a
chapter on the remarkable German poet H?lderlin.
_On Puns: _The Foundations of Letters_, a collection of essays by
distinguished scholars on 'the call of the phoneme' [which was the name of
the conference at which these papers were first presented]. [edited by
Jonathan Culler, Oxford 1988]. For those on the list who are fans of
deconstruction. Very punny. A+.
