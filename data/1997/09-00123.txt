Q: mArjArahatyA
This must be quite a widespread belief, then.
I happen to know that Bapa Rao is Telugu, while,
as I recall, someone from Maharashtra also referred
to such a belief.  In my own family (we are Tamil),
my mother and grandmother warned me that if a cat 
"lost even one single hair" because of me, I would have 
to go to "narakam" (i.e., hell. but temporary).  Why 
cats in particular?  Don't know.
Regards,
Raja.
