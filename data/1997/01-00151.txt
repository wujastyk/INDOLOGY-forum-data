Svara for Yajurveda mantra
In the Shuklayajurveda mantra 32.6, the second paada, yena sva.h ...
I found one reference with no svara for sva.h, while five others
have what appears like an anudaatta with a small vertical line on
the left side (|_____).  In the Rigveda for this mantra the word
has a svarita.
Could someone please explain the meaning of the yajurveda marking?
Thanks for any help you can provide.
