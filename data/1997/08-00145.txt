Yes, I can agree. So can you help me also with the term praticAra, which is 
mentioned together with cAra? Both are part of the list of 72 arts which a 
young m a n has to be taught (correct English??)

	Both meanings 'spy' and 'astrology' come naturally from a general
'to observe' and, despite Mayrhofer, cAra is probably linked with the Greek
verb tEreO 'to observe' (root *kvEr-) and not with carati 'to walk' (root
*kvel-).
	About using both spies and astrologers, I suppose a wise king use
all the ways to have knowledge of the ennemy, because even if you trust the
astrology, astrologers are men and can make mistakes.
