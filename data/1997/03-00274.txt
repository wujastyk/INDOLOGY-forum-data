List Members:
There is a job opportunity here at the University of Manitoba, but it is 
not specifically for South Asianists. It is for people in women's studies 
and the humanities. Therefore, South Asianists who have expertise in 
those areas would probably be able to apply. A copy of the advertisement 
is at this web site:
	 http://www.umanitoba.ca/programs/womans_studies/job.html

The application deadline is 30 April. 

This is a tenure-track, full-time position. 

I know nothing more about this position than I have already described 
above. Questions about it should be directed to the Women's Studies 
Program at the University of Manitoba. 

Best,
Bob Hueckstedt
