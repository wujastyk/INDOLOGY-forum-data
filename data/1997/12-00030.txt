John, do you have full bibliographic data on this? (Or was it written by P.
D. Gune himself?). I am interested in this too!

If it is from the root budh, shouldn't we expect boddhi < budh + dhi. It
still seems to me that bhuu is a better bet. But I am sitting at home, and I
don't have access to the better books in the Indological library. I
therefore have to rely on my faltering memory.
