In response to the enquiries from Jim Hartzell and David Magier about my
August 1994 list of Documentary Films and Videos on South Asian Religion:
no, I haven't updated it since (life has been too busy), though I have
occasionally thought about it and would welcome any additional material or
offers of help.  The original list is still available at the ANU Coombs
server at the following URL:
