Dear Catalin BUIU
Well, this is not a translation, though (the introduction
provides with a survey of the contents). The only complete
translation I know of is the Italian by Raniero Gnoli: La luce
delle scritture. Gnoli rendered also the smaller Tantrasara into
Italian.

There is also a french translation of Tantrasara by Liliane Silburn in
Hermes (nouvelle s?rie) No.1, Paris,1981.
There is also a fine scholar on Abhinavagupta in Paris who has done a lot
of research in the matter and published too. I do not think she has e-mail.
But perhaps you can contact her by snail-mail:
Colette Poggi,

F-75015 Paris T?l: 0033/1 42 73 33 90
There is an English translation of Abhinavagupta's
Isvarapratybhijnavimarsini. Colette Poggi has made a French translation of
it.
