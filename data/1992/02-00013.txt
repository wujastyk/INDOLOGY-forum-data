I had a note from John Clews today, asking me to pass on the following:
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Volume 5 of SESAME Bulletin will have a major focus on South Asian scripts
in most issues.
 
Also, he is advertising a book:
Ian Tresman, _The Multilingual PC Directory_ (Harrogate: SESAME
Computer Projects, 1992).  254 pp.  ISBN 1-873091-01-X.  20 pounds.
