THE COOMBSPAPERS DATA BANK - the ANONYMOUS FTP ARCHIVE
COOMBSPAPERS DATA BANK was established on 3 December 1991 to act as an
electronic repository of the social science & humanities papers, offprints,
departmental publications, bibliographies, directories, abstracts of theses
and other high-grade research material produced (or deposited) at the
Research
School of Pacific Studies and Research School of Social Sciences,
Australian National
University, Canberra.
In addition, COOMBSPAPERS DATA BANK  is intended  to serve also as a major
Australian electronic repository of research materials dealing with the
Pacific Region,
SouthEast and NorthEast Asia, as well as Buddhism, Taoism and other
oriental
religions.
Researchers in Australia and overseas are warmly invited to deposit with
this Data
Bank any high-grade documents which are not already copyrighted by someone
else
and which they wish to disseminate via the AARNET/INTERNET and other
academic
networks. All research documents send to the Coombspapers via ftp should be
deposited
in the /ftp/coombspapers/inboundpapers subdirectory.
