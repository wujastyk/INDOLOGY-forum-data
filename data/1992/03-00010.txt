chess
Status: RO
a collegue asks me to put his question before this audience:
is there a computer program playing chess according to (ancient) Indian
rules: queen only moving one step diagonally, bishops not much brighter etc.?
If not: would it be possible to write a new or patch an existing program
to implement the necessary rules?
