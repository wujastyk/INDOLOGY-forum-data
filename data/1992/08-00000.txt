I have a reference to a collection of papers published as a result of
the 1984 International Sanskrit conference. The collection is
entitled "Cultura Sanscrita: Memoria del Primer Simposio Internacional
de Lengua Sanscrita." What I don't have is the editor of the volume
and the publishing firm. If anyone happens to have this information
handy, I would be grateful to be informed.
