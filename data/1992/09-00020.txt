I am sorry but I have been unable to make sense of your message.
I believed I was sending someone a message yesterday requestinga
a copy of a paper on rhinoplasty in ancient India.  Sorry if I
mistakenly contacted you instead.  Nice to know your address,
though.  I would be grateful for citations of any of your work,
if it has been published, on thematic hierarchies.  Best regards.
