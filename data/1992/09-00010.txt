Harivamsa Translation
Status: RO
There seems to be some confusion on the Indology network between the Harivamsa
(the sequel to the Mahabharata) and the Harivamsapurana, which is a Jain work.
There is an English translation of the latter by P.L.Vaidya (Bombay, 1937-41).
See Ludo Rocher's book on the Puranas in the History of Indian Literature
edited by Jan Gonda (Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 1986), pp.91-93.
