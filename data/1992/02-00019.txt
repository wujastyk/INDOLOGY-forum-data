Subject: Kerala Astronomy query
Message-ID: <161227015252.23782.2222871227922712769.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>


I have this query from a colleague, and I wonder if any of you can help:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Calling all Indiologists, Archaeo-astronomers, etc!!!!!!!!
 
I know of someone in Kerala (State in SW India) who's writing a book on the
history of Kerala Astronomy, in particular (I quote) "I wish to show the
development of the concept of cosmos by the Keralite astronomoers of the
14th & 15th centuries".
Apparently a lot of the relevant works/books (including some from Missionaries)
have been translated into English,German,etc. and are unavailable in India.
 
I have been looking through the UL Computer (borrowable books) and have a list
of books which I think will be relevant. Can anyone help?
Anyone into Indology, and I can pass their address on? (I very much doubt he
has International E-Mail Access)
 
Thanks
