TO THE DEPTARTMENT OF RELIGIOUS STUDIES
INDIANA UNIVERSITY (BLOOMINGTON): Dr. J. Nattier
&
INDOLOGY DISCUSSION (LIVERPOOL)
FROM Fr. Patrick McReynolds
(in Indo-European Studies at UCLA)
Greetings (& Happy Holidays):
This is just an inquiry, since my availability will depend
on what my Archbishop in New York may decide in the meanwhile.
But I may be available for a post in History of Religions.
BA Gonzaga U. (Spokane, WA) 1972 in Theology and Philosophy
   (with classical course- Latin and Greek)
MA Fordham U. (Bronx, NY) 1978 in History of Religions
   (with courses in Sanskrit, and readings in classical and
     Buddhist Sanskrit texts)
(DD semi-honorary, Independent Catholic U., NY, 1980)
CPh UCLA (L.A., CA) 1985 in Indo-European Studies
   (Interdepartmental Program) (Ph D to be awarded next quarter)
I have done extensive work in Sanskrit and especially Vedic here,
and have also done course work in Pali and Prakrit languages;
and have a reading knowledge of several ancient languages
including Old Norse, Greek, Latin, Avestan; and also Lithuanian,
Spanish, French and German; and besides the I.E.-
Akkadian, Hebrew, and some work in Sumerian.
My background is in History of Religions, comparative mythology
and so forth (Fr. Thomas Berry at Fordham). And my dissertation
(BEFORE YMIR: THE PRIMAL PHASE OF AN INDO-EUROPEAN COSMOGONY)
is on a certain aspect of I.E. mythology; with several chapters
dealing specifically with Vedic and Indic besides Iranian issues.
Jaan Puhvel is the chairman of my committee here.
However, I am not much published outside of religious publications
of private or limited circulation.
I was a contributing translator for THE PLIGHT OF THE SORCERER
(Jaan Puhvel, & David Weeks eds.- a translation of a part of
Dumezil's Mythe et Epopee);
and have had some experience at college level teaching
at Fordham, and other experience lecturing thereafter.
If you think it might be worth my while to inquire or apply
further, please let me know.
If not, we will assume you are looking for more of a specialist
in Sanskrit or Indic studies, or someone who could make a firmer
commitment....
                               Sincerely,
                               +Patrick McReynolds
