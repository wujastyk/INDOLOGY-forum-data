Ayurveda in the US
Does anyone know of any Ayurvedic practitioners in the US.
A graduate student here at our University would like to use the Ayurvedic
system which he and his family avail themselves of in India. Any information
will be greatly appreciated. Hopefully, there will be someone in either the
Houston or Dallas area.  But any names will be useful.
