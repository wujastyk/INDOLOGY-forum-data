Devanagari OzTeX
Status: RO
For those who use OzTeX on the Macintosh and wan to use the Velthuis Nagari
fonts can now do so as I have bundled up the lot (and Peter Robinson here
at Oxford compiled the preprocessor into a stand alone application) into a
hqx encoded sit archive. If you want it, let me know. and I'd be grateful if
you could report back on how you find the fonts look and if there are any probs
with the preprocessor.
Telugu OzTeX coming soon I hope.
