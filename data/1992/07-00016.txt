Madhushree and Manjushree Fonts
        Stephen Miller has made a valuable suggestion.  It is possible to
keep the CSX coding and yet develop a different keyboard driver.  I was
trying to keep my work to a minimum.  However, if I can develop a keyboard
driver to my satisfaction, I will certainly rearrange the characters in my
font to conform to CSX.  Thanks, Stephen.
