Hinjra reference
Status: RO
While I did not receive any response to my inquiry about material
on devadasis, I would like to thank the several individuals who sent
replies on the subject of hinjras, and call general attention to one
additional reference we came up with here on our own:
    Nanda, Serena.  Neither man nor woman: the Hijras of India.
    1990.  Belmont, CA: Wadsworth.
