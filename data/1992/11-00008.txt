Notes about India from Classical sources available.
Indhist (Version 1.0) is a program similar to the UNIX (BSD) fortune
program.  Each time it is invoked it prints a random record from its
database.  Only, its database consists of notes about India from
Classical sources.  I have drawn mainly upon the translations of
Megasthanes and Arrian's works by John W McCrindle.
It (The Indhist project), the present version of which only runs under
UNIX, also includes a program to create a named pipe on the filesystem
which seems to have a different content (record) each time it is looked
at.
Chris Wooff has kindly consented to make Indhist available as a
UNIX SHAR from the Indology Listserver.  It is stored in Lpunch
format and is ready to go as of now. I hope you enjoy using it.
Best wishes,

Megasthanes, in the second book of his Indika, says that when  the Indians
are at supper a  table is placed  before  each  person, this being like  a
tripod.  There is placed upon it a golden  bowl, into which they first put
rice,  boiled as one  would boil barley, and then   they add many dainties
prepared according to Indian receipts.
