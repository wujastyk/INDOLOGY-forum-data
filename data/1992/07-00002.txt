Some new items of information:
        For those who use Macintosh computers:  I have designed a Roman
diacritics postscript font called Manjushree which provides all the
diacritics for Roman characters I could think of.  Secondly, I am also
close to finishing work on a Devanagari font called Madhushree.  This
font closely imitates the Nirnayasagara Devanagari.  Anybody interested
to know more about should contact me:

    Second item of information is that Kluwer Publishers recently
published as volume 13 of their Studies of Classical India the
following book of mine:
        The Meaning of Nouns, Semantic Theory in Classical and
        Medieval India.  Namarthanirnaya of Kaundabhatta.  Trans.
        and annotated by Madhav M. Deshpande.
