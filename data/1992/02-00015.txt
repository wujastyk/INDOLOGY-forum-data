Subject: Indian Email Addresses ( Repost )
 
I have had some requests to post the Indian Email addresses file.. along
with a few requests for info regarding the data base at sangam.  The
info has been incorporated into the FAQ maintained by Vikas Deolaliker.
 
The file follows..  However it must be mentioned that some of the node names
are changing.  The postmasters however have mailiases so that mail
addressed to these old addresses do get to the users.
 
Iam trying to compile a new list.  Once that is done, I'll post it ON THE NET.
 
The database at sangam is being updated constantly and is by no means complete.
So, if you know a friend of yours that has email facilities, but his/her
name does not appear in the database, ur best bet is to write to the
postmaster of that particular site ( not NCST @ Bombay ).
 
-----
 
 
Subsequent to my earlier posting on SCI, I have received > 3 dozen or so
requests for clarification and repost of the info regarding this subject.
Also, I have had questions like:
 
-> why cannot I finger delhi even though I can access the data base.
 
 
-> node shiva.ernet.in does not show why?
 
 
So, here is a repost with some info about the "FINGER"
 
As regards, why shiva.ernet.in does not show, it is 'cos NCST guys haven't
yet rcvd. info from that node.
 
 
First of all, it is *NOT* like the finger of UNIX systems.  It is just a
database maintained at NCST - a database that has enough info.
 
For more info and help regarding email addresses in India,
 
whois -h sangam.ernet.in  help
 
For a list of all the nodes in India,
 
whois -h sangam.ernet.in ""		-the double quotes are necessary
 
This w'd give info regarding the nodes presently represented in the
data base maintained by the NCST people at Bombay.
 
For a list of the nodes present in a given city,
 
whois -h sangam.ernet.in  city_name
 
where city_name can be part/whole of the city u wish to send mail to.
for eg. for a list of all node names in bangalore, try
whois -h sangam.ernet.in bang
 
 
Once the exact node name is known, to obtain the login name of the
person u wish to contact,
 
whois -h sangam.ernet.in  name_of_the_person at node_name
 
where name_of_the_person can be part/whole of the person's last/first
or middle name [ Nick names not allowed :-) ]
 
All searches are case-insensitive, so u need not worry about it.
 
 
ps: The NCST people are maintaining this database as a service to the public.
So, it is not a very good idea to flood the postmaster's mailbox with
requests regarding the database and with requests for forwarding the mail.
For u to get info on userids for nodes not represented on the database, pl
send mail to postmaster at the_node_u_want_to_send_mail.ernet.in
 
 
Hope this helps.
 
Chandra

   INDIAN E-MAIL ADDRESSES
 
                             SITES IN INDIA
 
 
  +============== ADDRESSING INDIAN SITES FROM OUTSIDE INDIA ==============+
  |                                                                        |
  |  If you are at a site that can     |   USER at SITE.ernet.in              |
  |  handle domains                    |                                   |

  |------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  |  Where: UUCP-PATH  - is the uucp path for the site. See list below.    |
  |         USER       - recipient's mail name on the destination host.    |
  |         SITE       - recipient's site name on the (ERNET) network.     |
  |                                                                        |
  |  Note:  Users using the C-shell under Unix systems may have to quote   |
  |         the "!" characters in the mail address.  This can be done by   |
  |         using "\!" in place of "!".                                    |
  +========================================================================+
 
     Each site is required to have a postmaster who can answer general
     inquiries about users and hosts at that site.
