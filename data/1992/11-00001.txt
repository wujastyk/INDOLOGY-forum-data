        Directory  Of  On-line  Religion Scholars
                     ANNOUNCEMENT:
   Earlier this year, a number of  individuals  researching  in
   the area of religious studies  responded to  the idea of
   an address book   which would make accessible the  e-addresses
   of  those who shared common interests. This  searchable
   address book is presently   available as  D.O.O.R.S.;a hyper-
   text  program that runs only on IBM compatible computers
   and  is available  via  FTP from 137.122.6.16 in the
   directory pub/religion as doors1.zip.
   The time for updating the address book has come. If you
   are interested in being included  simply e-mail your name,
   institution,and area of interest to the address below. If
   possible please use DOORS as the letter subject. Since Hyper-
   text only complicated things, this version will be available
   in a flat text ( Postscript, WP, Word, Ascii).
