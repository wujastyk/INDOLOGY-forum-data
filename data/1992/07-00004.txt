Comment: MSS FOR SALE
          Merry,
          I  am frantically trying to get ready to go  to the beach with my
          family (week before July 4) and don't have the time to figure out
          how to  get onto the CONSALD and INDOLOGY nets.  Could you please
          forward this message to  those nets  and  any  more    you  think
          appropriate?  Thanks, Allen
