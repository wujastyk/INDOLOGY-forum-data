Newspaper report on Hindu fundamentalism
Status: RO
The following article appeared in the London Independent
newspaper recently, and I thought it was relevant to the
recent remarks here about the Hindu slant of the picture
comics on Indian historical and cultural themes.
I don't want to drag INDOLOGY into a slanging match about
fundamentalist issues.  But as we were reminded by Prof.
Emmerick some time ago, in the Devanagari debate, our
field does have a political dimension, however abstract
our studies of vyakarana, jyotihsastra, etc.
