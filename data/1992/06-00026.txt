consulting the Library of Congress catalogue
Status: RO
This is just a point of general interest, rather than anything
INDOLOGICAL.  But I found that some local colleagues didn't know
that they could consult the LC catalogue directly from their
own computer accounts.
Try the following command: "telnet dra.com"
On machines which support IP (internet protocol) telnet and ftp, this
will connect you with the LC catalogue for author and title searching
(not subject, unfortunately).  Your terminal needs to be set to
vt100 (or above).
Also, try "telnet bbs.oit.unc.edu" and follow prompts for library
catalogues.
