Status: RO

I append below the timetable of the last few months of the
HSS held weekly at SOAS, since it might be of general
interest to INDOLOGY members to see who's currently doing
what.  I'll try to be a bit more timely in future, and
send in the *forthcoming* list!
 
If other INDOLOGists have active visiting speaker programs,
I for one would be very interested to see lists of speakers
and topics.
