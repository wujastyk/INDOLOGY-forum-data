Harivamsa Translation
Status: RO
Because I teach at a small regional institution I would be
grateful for citations of works on the topics of:  hinjras ('eunuchs')
and devadasis (temple prostitutes) in India, in order to assist a student.
 Our library system makes searches for some Indology topics difficult. Thanks
