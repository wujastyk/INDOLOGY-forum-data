Request for suggestions on teaching about Varanasi

It's interesting that you should mention Amar Chitra Katha comics.
I just bought a handful of them on the Jataka tales at the
"Hindu-Jain" temple in Pittsburgh.  I was surprised to find that
(at least so far) there is no mention of the Buddha; the
traditional ending of the tales has been omitted.
