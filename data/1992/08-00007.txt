CSX encoded version of Saundaryalahari now available for ftp
The Peter Schreiner version of Shankara's Saundaryalahari is
now available in Classical Sanskrit (CS/CSX 8-bit) encoding.
The anonymous ftp host is blackbox.hacc.washington.edu [128.95.200.1]
    the file to take is saundary.zip in directory pub/indic
    saundary.zip MUST be ftp'ed in binary mode, and must be
    unzipped on your end to be useful.  The zipfile is about 38K
    Those who have not previously visited blackbox may want to
    also examine README and UPDATES in the pub/indic directory.
    Cookbook directions for ftp novices follow my signature
cheers,
Tom

Novice ftp instructions:
  % represents the command line prompt on whatever your system is
    (if you have a Mac or other event-driven interface, it represents
     a motionless mouse cursor waiting for you to do something.)
     Stuff following % is what you tell your computer/the remote computer
     after you have made the connection.
  * marks a line of response from the remote computer to you
  %ftp 128.95.200.1       [or ftp blackbox.hacc.washington.edu]
*  blackbox FTP server (Version 5.18) (NeXT 1.0) Wed Aug 23, 1989) ready.
*  Name (blah blah blah):   [you say 'anonymous' without the quotes]
*  Password:                [you type in your email address
                             e.g. username at home.computer.edu]
*  Guest login ok, access restrictions apply.
   ftp>
  [from here, 'ftp>' represents the prompt the remote computer sends to
   you; stuff after the prompt is what you type]
   ftp>cd pub     [YES, blackbox is case sensitive PUB is not pub ]
*  CWD command successful.  [you may or may not get these feedback messages]
   ftp>cd indic             [I'm not showing the feedback anymore]
   ftp>binary
   ftp>get saundary.zip
   ftp>bye
That's it, you are done.
Some ftp programs (e.g. NCSA Telnet for Macs) do not automatically
initiate the ftp login sequence.  If you just get connected, but nobody
asks who you are after a decent interval, you can take the initiative and
say 'user anonymous' followed by carriage return 'password user at host'
If you are unable to connect by following these instructions, contact a
local guide at YOUR institution.  I regret to say that I will absolutely
not provide ftp assistance through email or telephonic communication.
