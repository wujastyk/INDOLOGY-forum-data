You'll find a reference to rhinoplasty in Basham, A.L "The
wonder that was India."  I think perhaps, he has quoted a
reference to his note at the end of his book.  I don't have the
book with me right now, so I can't look it up.  But I'll be glad
if you can send me a pointer to it if you do.
Thanks.
