Buddhacarita and Astadhyayi files now available
Status: RO
Dear Dominik,
        I got both the parts of the UUencoded Panini file, I joined
those into a single file and tried to run the UUdecode program
available to me on the University of Michigan system.  Alas! the
decode program comes back with the dreadful message "No begin line."
With the help of my colleagues I have tried several alternatives and
still I cannot UUdecode these files.  Is there a way of sending the
unencoded and unzipped Panini files?
