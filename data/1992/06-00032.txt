Subject: Brhatsamhita available in CSX encoding by ftp
Message-ID: <161227015415.23782.6243812095260847492.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Status: RO

The recently released version of Varahamira's Brhatsamhita is
now available in Classical Sanskrit (CS/CSX 8-bit) encoding.
 
The anonymous ftp host is blackbox.hacc.washington.edu [128.95.200.1]
    the file to take is brhatsam.zip in directory pub/indic
 
    brhatsam.zip MUST be ftp'ed in binary mode, and must be
    unzipped on your end to be useful.  The zipfile is about 195K.
 
    Those who have not previously visited blackbox may want to
    also examine README and UPDATES in the pub/indic directory.
 
    Cookbook directions for ftp novices follow my signature
 
Here is the preface for the unzipped file:
              VarAhamihira's BRhatsaMhitA
              (Version 3, June 5, 1992)
              digitalized by Michio YANO
              proofread by Mizue Sugita
              based on the edition of A.V.TripAThI
              (SarasvatI Bhavan GranthamAlA Edition)
              with reference to H.Kern's text
              [variants marked by K.] and his translation
 
              Converted to Classical Sanskrit (Extended) encoding
              by Tom Ridgeway at the Humanities and Arts Computing
              Center of the University of Washington, June 1992.
 
 
 note on original transliteration follows:
 [ Text was input by Kyoto-Harvard System, that is,
   Capitals for long vowels, linguals, anusvAra, visarga, and nazals,
   and z for palatal sibilants.
   Members of sandhi are not separated. avagraha is romanized by +a,
   external vowel sandhi is decomposed with the mark ^.]
 
 
You obviously don't see any CSX stuff in this copy of the preface as
this is coming to you through a 7-bit mail channel.
 
cheers,
Tom

Novice ftp instructions:
  % represents the command line prompt on whatever your system is
    (if you have a Mac or other event-driven interface, it represents
     a motionless mouse cursor waiting for you to do something.)
     Stuff following % is what you tell your computer/the remote computer
     after you have made the connection.
  * marks a line of response from the remote computer to you
 
  %ftp 128.95.200.1       [or ftp blackbox.hacc.washington.edu]
*  blackbox FTP server (Version 5.18) (NeXT 1.0) Wed Aug 23, 1989) ready.
*  Name (blah blah blah):   [you say 'anonymous' without the quotes]
*  Password:                [you type in your email address
                             e.g. username at home.computer.edu]
*  Guest login ok, access restrictions apply.
   ftp>
 
  [from here, 'ftp>' represents the prompt the remote computer sends to
   you; stuff after the prompt is what you type]
 
   ftp>cd pub     [YES, blackbox is case sensitive PUB is not pub ]
*  CWD command successful.  [you may or may not get these feedback messages]
   ftp>cd indic             [I'm not showing the feedback anymore]
   ftp>binary
   ftp>get brhatsam.zip
   ftp>bye
That's it, you are done.
 
Some ftp programs (e.g. NCSA Telnet for Macs) do not automatically
initiate the ftp login sequence.  If you just get connected, but nobody
asks who you are after a decent interval, you can take the initiative and
say 'user anonymous' followed by carriage return 'password user at host'
 
If you are unable to connect by following these instructions, contact a
local guide at YOUR institution.  I regret to say that I will absolutely
not provide ftp assistance through email or telephonic communication.
