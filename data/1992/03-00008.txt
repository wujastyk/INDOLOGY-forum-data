Apte's Practical Sanskrit-English dictionary also gives "recourse,
shelter, refuge, asylum, resort" for gati and cites these two passages:
 
vidyamaanaa gatir ye.saam  (Pa~ncatatra 1.320, 322)
 
aasayat salile p.rthvii.m ya.h sa me "sriiharir gati.h (Siddhaanta
    Kaumaudii---no page or suutra reference given)
 
As for the term _sat_, Apte offers the following equivalents (among
others): noble, worthy, wise, learned, firm, steady. "Steady" and "firm"
easily suggest "strict". Thus van Buitenen seems to have been on solid
ground in giving the rendering he did.
