help on Mahabharata passage
Status: RO
as far as I can see van Buitenen is not too wrong. His "strict" persons
are the santa.h, the "true/honest people/sadhus". The shelter seems to
be hidden in the gataya.h. I don't have a dictionary on me, but if he
translates _gati_ with "shelter", he must have reasons (parallels etc.) for
doing so.
