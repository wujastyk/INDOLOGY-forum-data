Whereabouts of M. Christopher Byrski
Status: RO
I would appreciate information on the whereabouts of M(aria) Christopher
Byrski, a Polish indologist. I will be visiting Poland, mostly Warsawa, this
July, and am interested in consulting with any and all Polish South Asianists.
Thanks for help in advance. From: Richard J. Cohen, SASIA at PENNSAS.UPENN.EDU
