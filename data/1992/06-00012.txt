Chaulukya period inscriptions
Status: RO
Does anyone know of a catalogue or listing of Chaulukya period (942-1304 A.D.)
inscriptions in Gujarat? A student at Oxford is keen to work on some
unpublished inscriptions from this period but has so far been unable to find a
catalogue or listing of unpublishehed materia
