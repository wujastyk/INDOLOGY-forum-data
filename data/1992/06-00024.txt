Richard,
Byrski is no longer Prof. of Sanskrit in Warsaw.  He accepted a diplomatic
posting as Attache for Education and Technology at the Polish embassy in
Delhi.  I visited him there, in Canakya Puri, in 1990, but I don't know
how long his posting was for.  Three years, I imagine.  It may be
over now, or close to finishing, and I guess Byrski will have kept a
foothold of some kind in Warsaw, domestic.
 
The other main Sanskritist in Warsaw, Marek Mejor, accepted a fellowship
in Japan at about the same time as Byrski went to Delhi.
