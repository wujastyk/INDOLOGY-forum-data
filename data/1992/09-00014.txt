I am sorry for the flurry of confused email between myself and Mimi
Klaiman which has taken up the bandwidth of this group on the last
couple of days.  Kindly ignore and accept apologies.
 
What happened is that we were hitting the "r" button to reply to
each other, while failing to notice that the "From:" field in the
mail header was -- of course -- being overridden by the "Reply-to:"
field.
 
Dominik
