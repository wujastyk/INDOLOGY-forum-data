I am mailing this to your list (Indology) at the request of
Mr Akella Vijay Bhaskar Pavella. If there are
any questions, I shall be happy to answer them or refer them
to the colleagues concerned.
 
An attempt was made to get Deccan College, Pune, on the network.
It has not yet succeeded. An attempt is being made to get
the Indira Gandhi National Centre for Arts, Delhi into the
network. This is also awaited. But the network is growing, and
we hope that all of you who are so interested in India
will be able to use the network to make your work easier.
