DIACRITICS FOR WORDPERFECT 5.1 AND LASER PRINTER
I am a new comer to your discussion group and might have missed
previous discussion on the subject.  Yet, I would like to ask
if anyone of you has information on existing programs for printing
Sanskrit diacritics on laser printers from  Word Perfect.
This information would be extremely useful for I am about to submit
my PhD. dissertation on Theravaada Psychology (the five aggregates).
The whole work has been entered on Word Perfect and I was able to
work out certain methods for printing some of the diacritics, but
since some of you might have a program taking care of the complete
set, I thought it was worth to ask.
Thank you,
Mathieu Boisvert
