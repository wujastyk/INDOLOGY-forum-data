Further to my note of yesterday, I found out what the file
devnagri.tar.Z at Duke is.  It is described by it's creator, Vivek

I picked up devnag.tar.Z from washington and managed to install it on
a Sun SPARC system.  i took out the MS-DOSisms of the text files so
they read nicely under unix, and added a README.unix file telling
exactly what i did to get it to work.  i also added a directory with X
Window BDF format fonts for use with the xtex dvi previewer (these
will need to be converted to the appropriate native X server format).
the whole package, with my additions, can be picked up from the host
cs.duke.edu as dist/sources/devnagri.tar.Z.
