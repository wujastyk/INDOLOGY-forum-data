BRHATSAMHITA
Status: RO
I am delighted to report that Michio YANO has generously
offered to provide the digitized text of
Varaahamihira's Brhatsamhitaa.  In due course
I shall lodge it with INDOLOGY and inform you
that it is ready for picking up.
I wish publicly to thank Yano for this free offer of many
man-hours of his work, which will benefit the indological
community immensely.
Do I detect signs of a snowball?  I hope so!
Dominik
