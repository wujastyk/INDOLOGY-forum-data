Early Indian Mathematics cites
In response to Vivek Dwivedi's question on Vedic Mathematics, I have the
following list that was sent to me nearly a couple of years ago by Professor
Kak of Louisiana State University.  Assuming that Professor Kak doesn't mind
dissemination of this list or his address, I enclose the following (it's not
exactly Vedic mathematics but might be relevant).
