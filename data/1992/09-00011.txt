It seems opportune to note that I am to prepare the translation of the
critical edition of the Harivamsa for U. of Chicago Press. The book will
include important "appendix" material that has been excluded from the crit.
ed., and use previously unpublished commentaries. Of course I'm more than
happy to take queries until the book is out.
