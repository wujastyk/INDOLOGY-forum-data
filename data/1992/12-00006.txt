Re: 6.0397  E-Text Query  (1/10)
John Haviland of Reed enquires re Sanskrit (or Hungarian) e-texts:
   A small sample of Sanskrit e-texts is available for anonymous
   ftp from blackbox.hacc.washington.edu in the directory pub/indic
   (Brihatsamhita, Panini Sutras, Buddhacarita and Saundaryalahari
    to be specific).
   These are encoded in the proposed Classical Sanskrit Extended
   standard for encoding romanized Indic languages.  For more
   discussion on this and related matters, I refer you to
   the listserv group Indology-l, based at liverpool.ac.uk

Sanskrit and Hungarian E-texts
Regarding John Haviland's request for Sanskrit and Hungarian e-texts,
I was able to find a few with a quick search in Georgetown
University's CPET (Catalogue of Projects in Electronic Text). I have
included a list below, beginning with the ten categories under which
the data is classified, and followed by info on projects with Sanskrit
e-texts and one project with Hungarian e-texts. I hope this information is
useful to many HUMANISTs.
If you are in search of other e-texts, the Georgetown CPET may be of use
to you as well. The CPET database can be accessed via Telnet or modem,
or if you send me particulars on what you are looking for I can do a
quick search for you and email the results. In any case, if you would
like more information on this service, just send me a note.
