Gillian, the books I mentioned are
Hasmukh D. Sankalia, The Archaeology of Gujarat (Bombay, 1941), and
M. R. Majumdar, Chronology of Gujarat (Baroda, 1960).
Both are excellent, but perhaps your student knows them already.  Of
course they concentrate on published, studied material, which is probably
the main problem.
The recently-published survey
 A. Ghosh, An encyclopaedia of Indian archaeology (Delhi: Munshiram Manoharlal,
    1989), 2 vols.,
is first class, and your student could systematically look up Gujarati place
names in volume 1 and see if work has been done on inscriptions.
