responses about PostScript Indic fonts
Dominik,
It is quite a lot to ask for free fonts.  There is little support
available to develop them.  If one is willing to buy them that is
another matter.
Jerome Bauer at the University of Pennsylvania has developed a
diacritic font for multiple language use (South Asian languages)
called South Asia Times.  I don't know his e-mail address but he
may be reached by writing:
         Department of Oriental Studies
         847 Williams Hall
         University of Pennsylvania
         Philadelphia, PA 19104
Last I knew he was developing a Devanagari font too.  Both would
be laser fonts.
