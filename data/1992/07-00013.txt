Thanks to the continuing energy of Peter Schreiner, we now have
the text of Sankara's Saundaryalahari.
 
This will shortly be available for anonymous ftp as the
file sanksaun.zip in directory pub/users/ucgadkw/indology on the
machine ftp.bcc.ac.uk, as announced recently.
 
Do you want me to lodge the file at Liverpool too, so that it
can be accessed via LISTSERV?  Contact me, if so.
 
Best wishes,
 
Dominik
