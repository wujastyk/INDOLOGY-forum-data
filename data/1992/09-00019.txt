Teaching as I do at a regional university, I do not always have infor-
mation at my fingertips to assist students planning term essays.  I would
be grateful for any complete citations from contributors for student-access-
ible materials concerning any of the three topics noted above; i.e.
Hindu eunuchs, temple courtesans, and the "sacred cow".  Many thanks.
