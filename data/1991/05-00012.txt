Syntax archives
Status: RO
Dominik Wujastyk suggested:
I certainly have no objection to keeping our discussions archived
and making the archives available on a regular basis. I presume if
the other discussants have an objection, they will let me know. I
shall keep the Indological Forum posted of the details of whatever
arrangement is eventually worked out to distribute these archives.
