Indian library addresses
Some progress is being made in locating MSS of the Ratisastra a.k.a.
 Ratiramana,Siddhavinodana. A valuable contact located an incomplete MS at BHU.
 I should
greatly appreciate it if members of this network could provide me with valuable
contacts at the following libraries in India: Pune, Madras, Baroda, Thanjavur.
I shall write the individual(s) requesting information about MSS of Ratisastra
and would appreciate using your names as an introduction. Many thanks.
Yours,

most appreciated. KZ
