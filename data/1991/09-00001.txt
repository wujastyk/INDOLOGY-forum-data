Indian library addresses
Dear Ken,
        If you need, you could use my name as introduction to write to
folks at the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute at Pune and Adyar
 ResearchLibrary and Centre, Madras.  Write to Professor R.N. Dandekar at BORI,
 Pune,
411004, India, and to Kunjunni Raja at Adyar, Madras.
        With all the best,
                                        Madhav
