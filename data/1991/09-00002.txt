F. Velthuis's nagari font now freely available
A (series of) forwarded messages follows, some
members of list Indology will be very interested in this:

notice of june.cs.washington.edu directory ~ftp/edu below,
I actually found the files devnag.zip and devnag.tar.Z in ~/tex
on june.  cheers --- Tom
