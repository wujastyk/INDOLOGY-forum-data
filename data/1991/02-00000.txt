Some time ago there was some discussion about writing a computer
program that would convert Samvat dates into their Gregorian
equivalents. I have no particular need of such a program, but I
would appreciate any information about the procedure that is used to
convert between the two calendric systems. Is there a standard
reference work that explains the conversion process?
