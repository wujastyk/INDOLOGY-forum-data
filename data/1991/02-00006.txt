Subject: ALLC Annual Report
Message-ID: <161227014965.23782.10799126197523487874.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>


At one of the conferences of the ALLC some years ago a Specialist Group
on languages and literatures of the Indian Subcontinent was formed, of
which I have been acting as "representative". The hope was that
the group would serve as a formum for the exchange of information; it seems
to boil down to my having to write an annual report. Now with INDOLOGY at
hand I would like to inquire whether any of you would want to shahre
knowledge about
projects, prospects, programs, activities, publications, method(ology),
software,  etc. which might be mentioned in the report for the benefit not only
of indologists but also of a wider public interested in literary and
linguistic computing.
Thanks and greetings,
 
Peter Schreiner
