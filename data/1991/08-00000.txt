To all re Bibliography of Thomas Burrow
Many thanks, Anna, for the reference to BSOAS 50. I have the volume and don't
know how I overlooked the obituary and bibliography. Have any other
obituaries been published?
At least you all now have in electronic form a fairly large number of
the items in Burrow's bibliography if you need them. It will save typing|
