Job opening at McGill
The Faculty of Religious Studies, McGill University, invites
applications for a tenure track appointment in Japanese Religion.
Teaching responsibilities will include Buddhism, Shinto, and New
Religious Movements. An ability to teach Chinese religions at an
undergraduate level would be an asset. This appointment is at the
Assistant Professor level and will begin June 1, 1991 (or later).
Candidates must hold the Ph.D. and demonstrate a strong research
potential. Salary will be commensurate with qualification and
experience (minimum salary for rank is $38,740). In accordance with
Canadian immigration regulations, this advertisement is directed to
Canadian citizens and permanent residents. Closing date for receipt
of applications is April 1, 1991. Applications, including a complete
dossier and at least three letters of reference received directly
from the referees, should be forwarded to Dean Donna Runnalls,
Faculty of Religious Studies, McGill University, 3520 University
Street, Montreal, Quebec, H3A 2A7.

Please pass the above advertisement on to anyone you know who may be
interested in applying. Canadian immigration regulations require
that if the post is offered to and accepted by a non-Canadian, the
hiring institution must show in writing that the person hired is
more qualified than any Canadian who applied for the post. But the
competition is open to non-Canadians.
It could be added that the ideal candidate would have the ability to
teach a wide range of East Asian religions at the undergraduate
level, and at the graduate level be capable of leading seminars and
supervising theses in the specialized area of Japanese Buddhism. A
strong knowledge of the Japanese language is therefore essential. The
tendency at McGill is to approach religious traditions through their
literary records.
