Dear Dr Kaujalgi,
 
I did indeed receive the following mail from you -- via the
Indology list at Liverpool.  This is a great development: one
of my abiding regrets has been that until now, the Indology discussion
has not been shared with colleagues in India.  I hope the arrival
of your email means that this situation will now begin to change.
 
There are two institutions in Delhi which seem to have an email
connection, although I have never succeeded in making contact:
the INSA and the IGNCA.  Do you have any information about them?
 
Best wishes,
 
Dominik
