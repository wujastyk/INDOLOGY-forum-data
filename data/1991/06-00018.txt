The International Journal of Indian Studies is a new interdisciplinary
forum for the scholarly presentation of research on all aspects of
Indian society and culture of the past and present. The journal
encourages the development of modern disciplines suitable for India,
by building on the civilization's own recognized system of categories.
Studies that make Indian material amenable to cross-cultural comparison
are also encouraged.
 
This new journal is published twice a year through Peter Lang
Publications Inc. Articles submitted for consideration are selected
on the basis of a blind referee system.
