Bengali e-texts?
With apologies to those of you who also subscribe to HUMANIST,
I forward the following query. Meanwhile I shall inform Kathleen
O'Connell of INDOLOGY, which she may find interesting.

Bengali texts?
A student of mine would like to find electronic texts in Bengali. Any
leads would be greatly appreciated. Please send them directly to the
student, Kathleen O'Connell, koconnel at epas.utoronto.ca, as well as to
Humanist itself.
Thanks very much.
Yours, Willard McCarty
