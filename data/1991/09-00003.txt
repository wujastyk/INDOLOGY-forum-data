>    Dear Mr. Mackay,
>
>    I developed a Devanagari font and software for use with TeX some time ago.
>    Thanks to a grant from my University it is public domain software now.
>    You can get the software with Anonymous FTP from rugrcx.rug.nl
 (129.125.4.12)
>    It is in the directory 'pub'. There is a devnag.zip for MSDOS and a
 devnag.tar.Z
>    for UNIX and other operating systems. I would appreciate it if you can
 put the
>    software on the University of Washington fileserver. I have no objections
 if
>    you want to add the software to the 'babel'-collection.
>
>    Yours sincerely,
