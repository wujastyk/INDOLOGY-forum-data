Dear All,
	my apologies in advance for raising an issue which has perhaps appeared
on this list numerous times. I have recently been asked by Christopher Lamb at
Middlesex Polytechnic if I know of any Sanskrit fonts/diacritics based on
Windows or Chiwriter. If anyone has any information could they please contact
me as below,
 
thanks in advance,
