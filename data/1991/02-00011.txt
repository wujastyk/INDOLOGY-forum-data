Machine readable text of Buddhacarita
Columbia University in New York has, within its library system, a new,
impressive Electronic Text Center, which is highly equipped, and which
has started collecting electronic texts of many sorts, in many formats,
and with many types of software for text analysis, manipulation, etc.
Among other interesting things, they now have the texts identified as
the 'demonstration disks' of the Asian Classics Input Project, entitled
"Ten Major Texts from the Kangyur and Tengyur Collections of Classical
Sanskrit Literature in Tibetan Translation, including native catalogs
to the Kangyur and Tengyur, with a special supplement: the Complete
Cataloged Listings of Tibetan Works of the United States Library of
Congress". This very large, heavily funded project has Tibetan monks in
India working night and day inputting these texts, and running them
through very rigorous accuracy checking. Full texts available in this
collection so far include:
   Abhisamayalamkara
   Madhyamakavatara
   Abhidharmakosa
   Pramanavarttika
   Vinayasutra
   Mulaprajna
   Uttaratantra
   Catalog to the Kangyur, Derge edition
   Catalog to the Tengyur, Derge edition
   Catalog to the Kangyur, Lhasa edition
   U.S. Library of Congress Tibetan-Language listings
   Selected errata to the Delhi edition of the Derge Kangyur & Tengyur

In order to help the ETC develop its collection of electronic texts, I
would be most appreciative if other members of this discussion forum
would alert to the existence of any other machine-readable texts in
the area of Indology (or even any other fields in South Asian
studies). Thank you very much.
