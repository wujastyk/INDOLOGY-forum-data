Richard Gombrich phoned me a few hours ago with the very sad news that
Bimal Matilal died at about midnight last night.
 
Bimal had been suffering from cancer of the bone marrow for some years,
and had had several remissions.  But he collapsed last week and was
taken to the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, where he was apparently
given only hours to live.  It was characteristic of his heroic struggle
against the disease that he fought on for several more days.
Throughout the course of the disease he endured great pain.  He was
only fifty six.
 
Bimal's wife Karabi, and his children, are surrounded by family and
friends.  The funeral will be at the Oxford crematorium, later this
week.  Obituaries will appear in the Times and the Independant, and
other papers.
 
Dominik.
