Dear J. Bronkhurst:
	I can help you with only one of those persons whose addresses
you are seeking, and that is Paul Kiparsky.  He is at the Department
of Linguistics, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA 94306.  His
E-Mail address is in the INDOLOGY listing.  It is
		kiparsky at csli.stanford.edu (Internet)
The address works:  he and I eschanged notes just before Christmas.
					Yours,
					Robert kD. King
					Austin, Texas
