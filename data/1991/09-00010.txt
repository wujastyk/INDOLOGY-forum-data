(Sorry about the strange layout of the quoted text above.  We have
a new Unix system here -- AIX  -- and several old workhorse programs
like mail seem to have developed little glitches.)
 
Some of the usenet groups are indeed archived, especially those
which distribute programs, both sources and binaries.  But
the discussion groups are less likely to be archived, and in the
case of soc.culture.india I am almost certain that the discussion
is not archived.  Unless some individual with an exceptionally
strong hoarding instinct is doing it privately.  The only way
to find out is to join up and ask the question.
