The body in Hinduism
A PhD student at SOAS (Anne Glazier) is currently beginning research
on "Concepts of and attitudes to the physical body in classical
Hindu thought".  She is gathering information and bibliographical
materials at the moment.  She will concentrate -- in the first
instance -- on the non-ayurvedic texts, looking in particular
at the ideas present on the subject in the 6 schools of philosophy.
Mrs Glazier would be most grateful for any pointers to books or
articles on this subject that you might be able to provide her.
Is anyone else working on this topic, to your knowledge?
(I will act as intermediary for this information.)
Best wishes,
Dominik
