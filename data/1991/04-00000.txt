To all on the network:
 
In am looking for any information pertaining to the Kamasastra text:
	Ratisastra  by a certain Siddhanagarjuna
	Text is also known as Adisastra and Siddhavinoda
 
It seems to have been a product of the Saiva tradition. Any data on this
treatise would be greatly appreciated.
