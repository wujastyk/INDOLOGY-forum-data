Dear Purushottama (and group),
 
Delighted to have you on board.  This forum is an ideal one for early
publicity about the forthcoming Australian World Sanskrit Conference.
You can announce things here, and about 50 indologists will know
immediately, and be able to tell others informally.  You could also use
this group for sounding out opinion about dates, sessions, or
whatever.  (If your really want to: a bit of autocracy in organizing
conferences can sometimes be a good thing.)
 
Another idea: other groups I know of distribute conference posters or
leaflets via groups like Indology.  The way to do it is to format your
document using TeX or LaTeX, or some other generic system using only
7-bit character codes, so that we can download, format and print.
PostScript would be another possibility, although it can be rather
verbose.
 
Dominik
