Subject: how to sign off INDOLOGY
Message-ID: <161227015025.23782.2464381256561047931.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

 
Status: RO

In response to Patrick's request to be removed from the INDOLOGY
list, the way to do it is for Patrick to send the message
 
     SIGNOFF INDOLOGY
 
to the address
 
     LISTSERV at LIVERPOOL.AC.UK
 
(or whatever address you ususally use for INDOLOGY, but with "LISTSERV"
in place of "INDOLOGY", since this is an instruction, not a message to
everyone).
 
Later, to rejoin from a new site, send the command
 
     SUBSCRIBE INDOLOGY Patrick Olivelle
 
to the LISTSERV.
 
I thought this might be of general interest.
 
==============================================================================
There is a lot of helpful documentation available about how the listserv
software (which is how INDOLOGY works) functions.  It is all sitting on
the Liverpool machine, and indeed any machine that has the LISTSERV
system running.  To find out what is available, and how to order it,
try sending the following commands (but not what's in square brackets) to
listserv at liverpool.ac.uk:
 
HELP         [this gets you some general help]
INFO ?       [this gets you a list of the documentation files available]
INFO REFCARD [this gets one of the files, a reference "card" of commands]
