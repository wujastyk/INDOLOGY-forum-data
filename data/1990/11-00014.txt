OED
One postscript:  I have observed before that the OUP has a tendency to
follow Monier Williams, and especially his dictionary, slavishly, in
their other dictionaries.  Julia Leslie, who wrote all the Indic
entries in the OUP's Reference Dictionary, had to argue strongly with
the editors about some definitions because they didn't want to budge
from MW.  They seem to grant him an authority far beyond what most
Sanskritists would accord him.  Perhaps because they publish his
dictionary too?  But nobody seems to have told them how much care must
be taken in using MW, and that paradoxically you have to have a good
knowledge of the language to use him safely.
