More on Dvandva's
On the subject of dvandvas, I might point out that English dvandvas are not
 only confined to phrases with "conjunctions inserted", as Brendan Gillon
 points out.  English in fact possesses a literally infinite set of dvandvas in
 the numerals:"twenty-four
twenty-five," etc. which in the Paninian system would be analyzed as "twenty
 and four, twenty and five," etc., with the possibility of synthesizing the
 phrases back to their original compound form.  These are orthodox dvandvas.
