More on Dvandva's
The term "dvandva" appears fairly widely in the linguistic literature
on compound formation, and in the sense in which the canonical phrasal
paraphrase of the compound is a set of conjoined nouns. See, for example,
Laurie Bauer's English Word-Formation (Cambridge University Press, 1983)
Chapter 2.12. Curiously, such compounds in English, inasmuch as they have
no overt indication of co-ordination, are confined to proper names: e.g.,
Alsace-Lorraine, Holt-Renfrew, etc. Where common nouns are involved,
conjunctions are inserted: e.g., book and magazine rack, a join or meet
lattice, etc.
