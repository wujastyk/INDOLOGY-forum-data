Subject: E-text of the Mahabharata
 
On behalf of one of our professor who is not yet connected to an E-mail
system I am looking for a machine readable text of the Mahabharata.
 
The text could be in the original (transliterated) Sanskrit or translated
into English or another language.  I would appreciate any information or
ideas on where to look.  Please reply to me directly and I will post a
summary on Humanist.  Thanks.
