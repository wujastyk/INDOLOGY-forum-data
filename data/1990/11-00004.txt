forwarded message: seeking Mahabharata e-text.
I am taking the liberty of forwarding this message from Randall
Smith, that appeared on the HUMANIST discussion group yesterday.
Please send any replies to Mr Smith directly, but send a copy
here to INDOLOGY too, please, since I'm sure we would all be
interested.
Best wishes,

E-text of the Mahabharata
On behalf of one of our professor who is not yet connected to an E-mail
system I am looking for a machine readable text of the Mahabharata.
The text could be in the original (transliterated) Sanskrit or translated
into English or another language.  I would appreciate any information or
ideas on where to look.  Please reply to me directly and I will post a
summary on Humanist.  Thanks.
