I'm no expert in the field, but I did just complete my second year of
academic Sanskrit study:  we read the Bhagavad Gita and portions of the
Kumarasambhava.  After 3 semesters.

I would recommend as an elementary text Robert Goldman's DEVAVANIPRAVESIKA
(sorry, but the diacritics are missing).  Then as an intermediate text we
used the excellent one by Professor AKLUJKAR, the name of which escapes me (is
he on the list, and can he be asked
the title of his book?)

So, as I mentioned with these two texts we were able, after 3 semesters to
spend the fourth reading the above alluded to works, which I'm told is
rapid progress for academic Sanskrit.

Sincerely,
Glen Cooper
