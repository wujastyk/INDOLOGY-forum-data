you may want to look at the 'kichkanyaa' stories from Nepal--the enticing
young female 'ghost' [a generic term] who hangs out under banyan/pipal
trees at night for young men--the backward feet are *the* telltale sign.
in 13 yrs in nepal i heard many first & 'second'-hand ghost stories,
but never in the case of kichkanyaa stories--seems people treat them
more as mythical folklore and not as 'reality'.
