lately there has been some discussion about what this group is good for.
Too many resignments let to the impression that there is little substance
in what is offered for communication. Since I have a severe problem with
not getting a book I'd like to read I wonder if the purposes of this list
could be extended to providing help with titles otherwise inaccessible.
    What I miss is: Gopinath Kaviraj (ed.): Festschrift Aditya Nath Jha
(I do not know if "Festschrift" is accually printed on the cover), Delhi
