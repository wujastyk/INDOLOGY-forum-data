"Hindu" is a Persian version of the Sanskrit word Sindhu, the name of the
river aka Indus.  Cf. Sind.   Any decent English dictionary will tell you
this.

The other etymology is nonsense.  There is no root "hin" to harm, nor does
"du" mean "without".  The root of words like ahi.msaa is "hi.ms".  This
attempt to etymologize Hindu as "Harmless" is part of a tradition of
didactic folk etymologizing that goes back to Vedic times.  As the history
of "Hindus" from Rigvedic warriors fighting the Dasas under Indra's banner
through the medieval fighting aakhaa.das to the Ayodhya mosque episode and
the current plans of the RSS and the BJP show, Hindus can be far from
"harmless".  Anyway, the idea of "harmlessness" and ahi.msaa arose and was
probably chiefly fostered amongst Buddhists and Jains.

I don't know where the "kush" in Hindu Kush comes from: I'd be interested
to know.  I've never heard "Hinduraj" as a name of those mountains, but
the suffix is just the Sanskrit "raaj", "to rule".
