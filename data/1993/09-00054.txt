Pali Text Society fax or e-mail number???
Sorry to bother the whole net with this, but I have a pressing need to get 
something to the Pali Text Society (or one of the council members) by 
October 1st, and my efforts on this side of the Atlantic have failed to 
turn up any FAX or e-mail access. If anybody knows of such a route, I would 
greatly appreciate hearing from you! Thanks in advance, Jamie Hubbard,
