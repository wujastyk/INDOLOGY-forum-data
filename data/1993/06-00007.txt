Subject: KAVYAMALA ISSUE

          Does anyone have a complete set  of  the Kavyamala still bound as 
          it came out as a serial, with each no. containing fragments of  a 
          number of works? Library of Congress has  one almost complete but 
          with two unbound issues one of which is missing part of the title 
          page.   It  is  dated January, I  expect  1900.   It contains the 
          following partial works: 
           
          Yasastilaka, p. 313-28 
          Brhatkathaslokamanjari, p. 217-40 
          Ravananarjuniya, p. 97-104 
          Harisaubhagya, p. 625-64 
          Kavyanusasana, p. 33-40 
          Pracinalekhamala, p. 49-52. 
           
           
          Could some one  tell  me which issue this  is?  Please respond to 
          the network so that  if anyone can answer no  one  else will keep 
          looking.
