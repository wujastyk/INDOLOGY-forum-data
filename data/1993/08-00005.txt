Why?????  I happen to be one who benifited from such an advertisement!  
I don't think it was an advertisement for a fast food chain, bur rather
support for those of us who choose to eat with a conscience.  Vegetarianism
happens to be a big part of India, and hense does belong in this discussion
group.
