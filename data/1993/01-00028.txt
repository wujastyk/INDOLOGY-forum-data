Subject: english transliteration using TeX

I have made a program, that can be used to derive scientifical transcription
of Hindi or Sanskrit typed in Devanagari-TeX transcription in TeX -- it is
table driven, so you can change the exat transcription you are using, and
added some macro's as to be able to print circle below or double dot below
accents -- I have also used this program to change the Devanagari-TeX
transcription to another, I like better. -- Well, I can also do two accents on
a letter, i.e., \~{\=a} will do the right thing.
