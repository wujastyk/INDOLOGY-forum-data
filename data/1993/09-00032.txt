collectives
I am doing some cross-linguistic research on collectives. In order to have
results I need the help of linguists who may give me some references on
the languages they are familiar with. Please send me  your e-mail address
to:
f5jtl at carina.unm.edu
I will send a questionnaire to those who reply.
Thank you.
