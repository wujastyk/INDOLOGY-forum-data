Aryabhata

What is to be noted first is that Aryabhat's view is not
'heliocentric' but he just maintained that the earth rotates
on its axis.  There is no clue in Aryabhata's Aryabhtiya about  how he
got this idea.   But we suspect that the idea was transmitted from
Greek astronomy where similar idea was offered by Aristarchos.
It is interesting to note that the Indian way of objecting this
idea is very similar to that given by Ptolemy.
I have written a paper on this topic:
YANO, Michio "Aryabhata's possible Rebuttal to Objections to
his Theory of Rotation of the Earth",
