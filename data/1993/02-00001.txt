Does anyone know if, aside from TELUGU, there are lists specific 
to other individual South Asian languages, ancient or modern?

          There is  one  on Tibetan, a 'para-South Asian language,'  but  I 
          have mislaid the information on  it.  Does anyone know about this 
          network?
