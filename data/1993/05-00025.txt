In response to the inquiry from Lowell Jaks, McGill University

The wording of your message gives the impression that you are unaware of
the three entries under Mahaa-nirvaa.na-tantra in M.B. Emeneau's A Union
List of Printed Indic Texts and Translations in American Libraries (p.
313). These entries do not include an edition with 'Sa.nkara's commentary. 
However, they may be helpful to you in gathering further information about
the specific edition in which you are immediately interrested.
