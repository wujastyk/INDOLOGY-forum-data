Unidentified text ref in .Sa.tkha.n.daagama
In Vol 1 of the Sholapur ed. of the above work there are freq refs in the
notes to a Praa. Pa.m. This abbrev appears to be lacking in the list of
same found in the front matter to the volume. Can someone more familiar
with Jain literature than I identify this work for me?
