None
I am compiling a handbook of networked resources for Religious Studies
(and related areas). This bibiography is freely available on the Net
from listserv at uottawa or listserv at acadvm1.uottawa.ca as
mystics v1-txtx and mystics v2-txt.
Can you send me information on  INDOLOGY LIST
to be included in the bibliography?
Thank you kindly,
