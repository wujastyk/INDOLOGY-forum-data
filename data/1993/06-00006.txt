Ken, I have a copy of a paper by Nakatani from the last world Sanskrit
conference in which he outlines his input scheme (and a metrical analysis
program).  Can you deal with a postscript file?  Or TeX?  Or is it simplest
if I just post it?  I should add that although his input scheme is fine, it
seems to me not especially better than, say, Velthuis's.  It is a set of
equivalences for easy typing.  For example,
a = a
i = i
u = u
retroflex vowel r = R
retroflex vowel l = L
etc.
Also, don't overlook the Chiwriter->TeX program.  You should evaluate it
before doing lots of labour intensive stuff.
