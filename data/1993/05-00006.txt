Bahuvrihi Compounds (fwd)
IT IS QUITE CLEAR THAT THE PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THE DISCUSSION ARE
MORE QUALIFIED THAN I AM IN SANSKRIT. I HAD SANSKRIT IN HIGH
SCHHOL FOR FOUR YEARS AND I STILL RECALL THAT BAHUBRIHI MEANS
A PERSON HAVING MUCH RICE. INFACT, THE WORD BAHUBRIHI ITSELF
IS AN EXAMPLE OF BAHUBRIHI SAMASA. THE VYAS VAKYA FOR BAHUBRIHI
IS A PERSON PERSON HAVING MUCH RICE. I THINK YOU SHOULD LOOK
INTO THE MEANING OF THE WORD "BRIHI" BECAUSE THAT'S THE WORD
WHICH IS CREATING THE PROBLEM HERE. I DISAGREE WITH THE SUGGESTION
THAT BAHU IS DERIVED FROM BAH+ WHICH MEANS OUTSIDE AND BRIHI
COMES FROM THE WORD VRIKSHA WHICH MEANS IN SOMEWAY ROOT.
SO THE WORD BAHUBRIHI MEANS OUTSIDE THE ROOT. VRIKSHA MEANS TREE
AND NOT THE ROOT AND THERE IS NO SUCH WORD BAH+ WHICH MEANS
OUTSIDE. WELL THERE IS MY 2 BITS.
