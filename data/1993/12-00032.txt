  Yes, CDAC has them -- two versions -- PostScript type 1, which will come
  with their ISM manager for Indic scripts if you order it. (These fonts are
  also use in most Oriya newspapers -- atleast it is the same as in the
  newspaper I bought while I was in Orisa -- you can get it at LINGUA, 63B
  Woodhead Road, Holmfirth, HUddersfield HD7 1PR, tel 0484 686396, fax 0484
  687320 (reminder: in the U.K.) I have never seen a TeX font for Oriya, only
  heard a roumor somebody was working on it.
  Success, and keep me informed about it. If you get PostScript fonts, I will
  be able to make them work with TeX -- at least if you have a Mac or a
  postscript printer.
  Best Wishes,
