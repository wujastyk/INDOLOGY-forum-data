Alone in the Internet, the British JANET network uses "big-endian"
addressing: i.e.,
    Me at universe.world.country.town.house.
The rest of civilization uses little-endian conventions:
    Me at house.town.country.world.universe.
The above address "indinst at uk.ac.ox.vax" is in JANET big-endian format.  If
you turn it around: "indinst at vax.ox.ac.uk" you have a proper Internet
address which should work.  If it doesn't, then the reason is local to your
computer or mail gateway, and not a problem with the address.  (About five
years ago a lot of USA mail computers still didn't know about "uk" as
an email domain: there's no excuse for that today.)
