Diacritics for Word Perfect
I seem to remember some time back that several individuals(?) have developed
screen fonts for the diacritics in Word Perfect for  use in transliterating
Sanskrit and other South Asian languages.  Could anyone who is using
Word Perfect for South Asian language transliteration contact me regarding
their setup.
