Subject: Pali canon on disk?
Message-ID: <161227015590.23782.14295561198365112478.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

A second-hand report reached me last week that a project to
put the whole of the Pali Text Series volumes onto disk was
well advanced.  Can anyone confirm or deny this?   If it 
*is* being done, how is the text being tagged/encoded?
And what will the terms of availability be?

some recent email has my address as ucgadkw at link-1 or some such.
This is spurious, known, and under repair.  The header above in this
message is correct.
