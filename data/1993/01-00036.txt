I second that observation. I tend to believe that the spate of people,
mainly with Indian-sounding names, leaving the list is because of the
lack of discussion on any Indology-related topics that many of them 
probably expected to happen and be interested observers in. To that
extent, Dr. Kak's posts are a reason for many of them NOT to leave.

Amen.
