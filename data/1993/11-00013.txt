Subject: Temple Priests
Content-transfer-encoding: 7BIT

I have been working on the temple priests of Maharashtra for some
time now. These priests are called GURAV.They also call themselves
Devalaka brahmins.The Devalaka myth comes from the Shivapurana.
Devalakas are considered to be inferior Brahmins,probably due to the
fact that they accept remuneration for their services.Actually the
Marathi Brahmins call the Gurav "Shudras".I have traced the Gurav
back to Karnataka where they are called Goravas.
If you are not sufficiently confused yet,let me continue. In trying
to relate the Gurav to Goravas, Devalakas, Temple-worship and their
current status as Shudras in Maharashtra, I have to find answers to
the following questions:  1] References to Shudras being custodians
of Idols in the distant past. 2] Early history of Shaivism and the
way it coalesced with Aryan\Brahminic religion, 3] References to
Devalakas between 200 AD to now, 4] Early history of Kalamukhas{who
were called Goravas}, 5] the origin of the Jnansamhita of the
Shivpurana 6] The status of the temple priests in other parts of India
Can anyone help?
