You might want to look at:
V.V.S. Iyer, Studies in Kamba Ramayana
V.S. Mudaliar, Select translations from Kamban

Also, A. Maharajan's "Kamban" has brief translations throughout
with some rather helpful comments. It is part of the Sahitya Kala
Akademi's Makers of Indian Literature Series and was published in
1972, reprinted in 1989. Those who know this series will also know
that the volumes tend to be patchy in quality, albeit this is better
than some of the others I have seen.
