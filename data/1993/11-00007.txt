          Would any library like  the following Marathi books which I  will 
          donate if I get an acknowledgement for tax purposes:

          Pakshi vijnana

          I'd  give them  to  LOC  but  they  are outside the scope of  our 
          policies.  They  might  be  of  some  use  in  language teaching, 
          however.
