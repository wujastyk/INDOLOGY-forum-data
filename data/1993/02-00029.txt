The person who knows history of Indian magic square very well
is Takao HAYASHI, Prof. of Doshisha University, Kyoto, Japan.
He is on network and subscribed INDOLOGY, but he does not
access very frequently.
  His e-mail address is F50893 at JPNKUDPC.BITNET
 
I will telephone and ask him to have access and send his reply.
