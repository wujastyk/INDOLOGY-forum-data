the file santext.zip
I had intended the uuencoded file of santext.zip to go to Alan Thew (who
cherishes the listserv software for us) for his delectation; somehow it got
posted to Indology at large.  I'm very sorry for the wasKed bandwidth, and
any time you might have lost trying to use it or work out what it is.  Just
chuck it away.
I seem to be a bit error-prone these days.  Luckily I'm off for three weeks
in the Mediterranean next Friday, and I'll leave you all in peace.
