I hope my recent message will help people who want to unplug from INDOLOGY.
I have also sent private messages to most of the folk trying to resign,
explaining again how to do it.

As a matter of curiosity to anyone who may still be with us, but is trying
to leave (:-) why this sudden efflux?  Is there something about INDOLOGY I
haven't spotted?  Some subtle political incorrectness, perhaps?  (Are we
still allowed to say "India"?)

Again  :-)

Dominik
