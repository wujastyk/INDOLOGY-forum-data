Magic squares
Prof. David Pingree asked me many years ago to keep him informed
of any magic squares I found in Sanskrit MSS as I catalogue.  I
believe it was on behalf of one of his students (it may well have been
Hayashi).
Anyway, I normally record the presence of such magic squares in the
Wellcome Sanskrit handlist(s).  I can do a list of titles if anyone
wants.
