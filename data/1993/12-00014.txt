Hello everyone,
My name is Pankaj.  I'm new on this list so I thought I would drop a line
introducing myself.  I am an undergrad student at New York University,
studying Finance and Information Systems.  I am and have been for a long
time, very interested in Indian mythology and classical history.  I thought
this would be a good way to talk to people with similar interests.
