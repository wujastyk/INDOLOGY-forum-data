        I have seen an old article by Rick Briggs.  Its title is "Knowledge
Representation in Sanskrit and Artificial Intelligence".  This was published
in the Spring 1985 issue of The AI Magazine, pp. 32-39.  Additionally, I
have a typescript of his old paper titled "Shastric Sanskrit as a Machine
Translation Language."  I would like to know about his more recent work
if anyone has seen it.
