     FYI: The National Security Education Program (NSEP) is due to 
     begin implementing pilot programs in 1994 in the following 3 
     areas: 
     1) undergraduate scholarships to allow U.S. citizens to pursue 
     serious study abroad in "critical world areas" defined as 
     countries outside the U.S. except for Canada and Western Europe.

     2) graduate fellowships to encourage U.S. citizens enrolled in or 
     admitted to graduate programs in U.S. institutions of higher 
     learning to develop expertise in the languages and area studies 
     or less commonly studied countries.  Two types of fellowships are 
     available: a) for doctoral candidates to study critical foreign 
     languages, disciplines, or areas which will strengthen the 
     national capacity in international education; b) for students in 
     professional and scientific disciplines to offer serious 
     opportunities to internationalize their educational experience.

     3) institutional grants to assist U.S. college and universities 
     in strengthening their institutional capabilities toward a 
     national capacity in foreign languages, area studies, and 
     international fields.

     I believe $10 million has been allocated for 1994 with following 
     years to be funded from the interest from the $120 million NSEP 
     Trust Fund. 
     A letter from the NSEP Office was sent out in late October to 
     college and university presidents asking that a NSEP 
     Representative be named on every campus to screen and sign off on 
     each student application.  This, I believe, mirrors the current 
     administration of the Fulbright awards. 
     I encourage everyone to inquire about this new source of funding 
     since NSEP seems tailor made for students and scholars of 
     Southeast Asia.
