Panini's grammar and Boolean logic
	I'm not sure that I even understand what exactly is meant by the claim 
"Panini's grammar is based on Boolean logic"!!  However, the following might
shed some light on issue:
	Backus-Naur Form (BNF) is the most commonly adopted notation for 
describing the grammars of computer languages (such as Pascal, C..)  According 
Ingerman(*), this notation is similar to the one employed by Panini in 
describing the rules of Sanskrit grammar.  No, I have not read the source.
I am just quoting from the foot-note of a text book..
(*) Ingerman, P.Z. [1967] "Panini-Backus form suggested", Communications
			   of the ACM, 10:3, 137.
