New program for transliteration
Hi Dominic,
You may be aware of the program tcs, which translates character sets
via Unicode. At the moment it understands the
ISO standard character sets, the major East-asian character sets and Unicode.
it is available for ftp from research.att.com
It does not do transliterations, but it can easily be extended to do so.
