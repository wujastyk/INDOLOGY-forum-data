Hi, I am an orientalist and I am new to this list. Even if my main interest
is japanese culture indeed, actually my linguistic interest often takes me
beyond the restricted Rising Sun area.
 
Probably my question is a FAQ and I am sorry to annoy all of you with this
ususal matter. Do you know any shareware editor or wordprocessor for MS-DOS
6.0 or Windows 3.1 by which I can write in devanagari?
 
Thank you
