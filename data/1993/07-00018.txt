Can anyone help me locate an article by Helmuth von Glasenapp dealing
with the Adbhuta Ramayana?  It is in German and may be in the
Abhandlungen der geistes- und socialwissenschaftlichen Klasse der
Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur in Mainz.  I have the
reference orally from a reliable source, but the best I've been able
to turn up is Glasenapp's Zwei philosophische Ramayanas, which deals
with the Yogavasishtha and Adhyatma Ramayanas.
Thanks for any counsel you can provide.
