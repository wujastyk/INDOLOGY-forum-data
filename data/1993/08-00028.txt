  There is a Postscript font called Palladam which is available on
several archives, including ftp.cica.indiana.edu unless I am mistaken.
This would not be of any use unless you have ATM or a way to convert it
to TrueType.
  Some possibility exists that others may become available; I would monitor
the Indology list for any announcements of same.
