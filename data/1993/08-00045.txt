RE: text of Rasaratnakara
To Dominik Wujastyk,
    RE: The Sanskrit Manuscript of the Rasaratnakara
Dominik, I don't  know whether you remember me from the Indian 
Studies conference in Wisconsin about five years ago. But I was 
the young scholar who had lunch with you and discussed Nagarjuna's
text of the Rasaratnakara and its relationship to tantra and 
alchemy. I would like to know if you edited and translated the 
entire text, and if so where and how can I get a copy of these
materials. Also I would like to know if I could obtain a copy of
the text text itself. The one you had at the time of the conference.
Please let me know id this is possible and how much it will cost and 
where where to contact you by mail. Thankyou.
