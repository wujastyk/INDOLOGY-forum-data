Panini's grammar and Boolean logic
	In the April, 1993 newsletter of Motilal Banarsidass, it
states that Rick Briggs (who works for NASA) has argued that Panini's
grammar is based on Boolean logic.  I was wondering if anyone was
aware where he might have advanced his thesis or if there are any
other sources where this same thesis is discussed.  Thanks in
advance.
