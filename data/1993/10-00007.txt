Subject: Panini's grammar and Boolean logic
Message-ID: <161227016186.23782.13406632739703211250.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

	In the April, 1993 newsletter of Motilal Banarsidass, it
states that Rick Briggs (who works for NASA) has argued that Panini's
grammar is based on Boolean logic.  I was wondering if anyone was
aware where he might have advanced his thesis or if there are any
other sources where this same thesis is discussed.  Thanks in
advance.
