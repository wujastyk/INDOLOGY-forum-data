Earlier today I said,

The short answer is that from any machine connected to the Internet,
and having the program "telnet", you issue the command

     telnet dra.com

and you should then get access to the LC catalogue.

There are hundreds of other libraries, though, and the easiest way of
consulting them is by using a program called Gopher.

The best way to find out more is to buy and read Ed Krol's superb book
"The Whole Internet: User's Guide and Catalog" (Sebasapol, CA:
O'Reilly & Assoc., 1992).  ISBN 1-56592-025-2.  It explains
*everything* and is very well written.

Best wishes,
