MAGIC SQUARES
I too would be interested in any work on magical squares, or
more generally, magical (and unmagical) diagrams in Indian
traditions - Jain especially, but not exclusively.
I would also be interested, Allen, in references to the two
Schuyler Cammaan articles you mention.
(This is in the context of something anthropological I have
to write fairly soon on the use of diagrams and other non-
figurative representations).
