I must apologize for making a wildly speculative conjecture in
such an unscholarly manner.  I admit I got carried away when I
read the original query and connected Bahu with Bahi: which
stands for "outer" (as in Bahishprajna for consciousness of externals 
(in Mandukya Karika 1.1)) and vrihi with vrih+ which, Monier Williams
conjectures, meant "to grow" (He also says vrih+ is a possible
ancestor of the word Brahma meaning the primordial substance of
the universe).

I would have apologized sooner, but since the message was all in
uppercase, it took me a while to get to grips with it.  :-)

Cheers.
