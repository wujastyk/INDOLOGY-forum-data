RE: Jai Singh's observatories
I have a copy of Vigyan Bhairava, but I have never paid much attention to it
since it seems to be just a compilation of very short descriptions of various
techniques of meditation. Perhaps I should go back and check just what it says
on this point. Are there any other references, Indological, Sociological or
just popular, on this practice ?
