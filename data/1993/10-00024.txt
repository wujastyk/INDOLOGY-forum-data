List of Language Lists, Version 1.3
Computer Bulletin Boards for Individual Languages,
or,
The List of Language Lists
Prepared by Bernard Comrie & Michael Everson
Version 1.3 (12 October 1993)
This file lists bulletin boards devoted primarily to the
linguistic study of individual languages and groups of languages
(though a couple of others, in particular lists for language
learners, have been included as well). It would be great if other
correspondents to LINGUIST will be encouraged to maintain
corresponding lists for branches of linguistics, particular
approaches to linguistics, language teaching, etc.
The usual way of subscribing to a list is to send the following
message to the listserver (not to the address for enquiries):
  SUBSCRIBE <name of list> <your first name> <your last name>
In the listing below, the name of the list is given in capital
letters inside parentheses. When you subscribe, you will receive
instructions on how to contribute to the list, and on how to
remove your name from the subscription list (usually: SIGNOFF
<name of list> (UNSUBSCRIBE works too)).
A list of mailing lists available on Internet is available by
anonymous ftp from ftp.nisc.sri.com (192.33.33.32) in the file
/netinfo/ interest-groups. A directory of scholarly electronic
conferences is maintained by Diane K. Kovacs
(dkovacs at kentvm.bitnet or @kentvm.kent.edu) and is available by
sending the message
     get acadlist readme
to one of the following addresses:
     listserv at kentvm.bitnet
     listserv at kentvm.kent.edu
The materials you will receive include instructions for getting
more detailed descriptions of particular sets of electronic
conferences (e.g. LANGUAGES, LINGUISTICS). Those interested in
contacting speakers of languages (not necessarily linguists)
should also consider contacting the appropriate soc.culture list
(e.g. soc.culture.polish).
The order of the lists follows somewhat the Library of Congress
Subject headings; no attempt at bibliographical perfection has
been	attempted.
This list is available by anonymous ftp from colossus at irlearn.ucd.ie
(137.43.50.59) in /everson.

This list will be deleted from Version 1.4 because it really
isn't about what it says it's about. There is extremely high
volume on this list and, in the words of the list itself:
 "The discussions on WORDS-L are wide-ranging. Although the
list began as a forum for discussion of the English language, it
has evolved through the years into a discussion of anything the
subscribers want to discuss. If you are looking for a
single-topic list, you will probably not be happy here."

This list still exists, sort of. The RUSSIAN bulletin board at
listserv at asuacad still has all the old files from the discussion
group, but the group moderator, Andy Wollert (ispajw at asuacad)
is no longer associated with Arizona State University that
houses the list server.  Thus no new discussion. The list is
"held".
If anyone is interested in reviving this list, contact
postmaster at asuacad.
