Sanskrit etexts
On Fri, 18 Jun 93 20:02:03 BST Lars Martin Fosse said, in Norwegian,
Which I don't think he meant to send to the Indology list but:
He wants to know if anyone has encoded Sanskrit texts which could
be exchanged. He himself has prepared the fables from the first
boosk of the Pan%catantra.
I only subscribed to this list today! :-) and I am busy reading the
archives. I note that in the archives there are copies of the
Buddhacarita and several other things (which names I can't read
while I'm in this mailer). I myself have some S/ankara and
Patan%jali around somewhere. Are the texts in the Indology archive
text-only or something else? I'd like to know if I can read them
on the Mac.
Mon det er et svar til Din sp|rgsm}l, Lars?
