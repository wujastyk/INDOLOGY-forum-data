Candrabindu with LaTEX
                                          Wednesday, January 27, 1993
Depending on the transliteration scheme in use, in addition to the
TEX diacritics already described, one may also want to float a
"candrabindu" (looks like a brev with a dot above the middle) over
a letter.  THe following works, but is dependent on the size (point
size) and possibly width of the letter beneath the candrabindu.  With
a lower case "m":  \u{\hspace{-.1in}\.{m}}   
Note that this is LaTEX, not TEX.  Someone with more TEXpertise could,
no doubt devise a less dependent solution.
This is of course a purely personal proposal; it has no official
government or religious sanction.  I am not responsible should
it prove devotionally or otherwise ineffective.
     Good luck,
