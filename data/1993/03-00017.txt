Free journals!
In a fit of spring cleaning I have decided to rid my office of
a four-year run of 'India Today' (International edition). There
are approx. 90 issues, from October '85 to October '89 (which
means that there must be some missing, but I haven't checked which).
I know this is not a very enticing offer, but would anyone like them
before I consign them to the recycling skip?  I can deliver them 
within the Oxford (UK!) area, or they can be collected.
