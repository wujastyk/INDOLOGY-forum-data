Hello Friends,
	I have seen several queries regarding Indian Language Fonts and 
Script systems on the Net. Being myself interested in this topic, and led 
by Mr. Abhijit Datta's message that such "Professional Quality" software
is avaialable from The Government of India sponsered Research Institute
named C-DAC, I have contacted them to obtain details. They have provided 
the following information about their software and hardware products which
I am putting on the net with their permission for the benefit of other people.
Below is the communication of their permission, which also gives contact
address if you want to obtain their products. (PLEASE NOTE THAT I HAVE NO 
CONTACTS OR INTEREST IN C-DAC and I am putting this information on the net 
for "purely" information sake. - K.Desikachary)
