RE: Issues in the creation and dissemination of Sanskrit e-texts
Mr. Mehta:
You have thrown out a tantalizing piece of information... "a good friend
of mine, who while managing something called the "Rock Art Collection" (!)
has been instrumental in creating a microfiche database of some 3 million
Sanskrit manuscripts..."  If this isn't the Indira Gandhi Center project, then
you must tell us the name of your friend and how we might contact him.
