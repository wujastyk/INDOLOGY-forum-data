oriented and not doctrinaire, and whereas tantra has been suppressed 
in India for some time, the west has seen a flowering of tantra 
(technology) in recent history. Tantra-like approaches can be found 
in many old traditions of other cultures, and hence bespeak of the 
human condition as opposed to just a particular Indian tradition.....

I am not sure that I can agree with you until I see more evidence. The word
'tantra" itself apparently means loom, and hence has the connotations of the
Greek 'techne'. But that is where the similarity ends. I have not seen any
evidence that schools of tantra ever studied technology in the narrow sense of
the term - that is fields such as metallurgy and the like. 

 If one includes exploration of the processes of consciouness in the domain of
technology, then perhaps it might be true. But even there I would have
reservations. There seems to be such a frightening accretion of ritual in
tantric texts that it often obscures much that they might have had to say.But I
could be wrong and will defer to better judgement.
