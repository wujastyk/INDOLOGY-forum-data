No.  Well, actually the British Library catalogue as a whole is available,
and the IO may be part of it by now.  The BL service is called "Blaise" and
costs MONEY.  I consider this to be an ongoing public scandal of serious
magnitude.  Almost a hundred British university libraries are available
over JANET free of charge

Can someone tell me how to access the British library catalogues via INTERNET?
Actually, their availability comes as  a (pleasant) surprise, since ten years
ago, the Bodleian for example, did not even have a proper card catalogue. I
routinely dial into the various American library catalogues, of course.

  In addition to consulting the Data Research version of the LC catalog,
as Dominik suggests, it is also now possible to log in to the LC system
with the command:

   telnet locis.loc.gov

This gives access to a much wider array of resources at LC.

Dominik: I saw your posting on the BL.

> I can sit in my office and consult LC, but not the BL which is about two 
hundred

I would be very much interested if you could please let us know about this 
possibility on this net.

kind regards
