No.  Well, actually the British Library catalogue as a whole is available,
and the IO may be part of it by now.  The BL service is called "Blaise" and
costs MONEY.  I consider this to be an ongoing public scandal of serious
magnitude.  Almost a hundred British university libraries are available
over JANET free of charge 
Can someone tell me how to access the British library catalogues via INTERNET?
Actually, their availability comes as  a (pleasant) surprise, since ten years
ago, the Bodleian for example, did not even have a proper card catalogue. I
routinely dial into the various American library catalogues, of course.

Re: India office OPAC?
  In addition to consulting the Data Research version of the LC catalog,
as Dominik suggests, it is also now possible to log in to the LC system
with the command:
   telnet locis.loc.gov
This gives access to a much wider array of resources at LC.
