Sanskrit version of verse from Isa Upanishad
I am not familiar with the conventions for transcription into roman script,
but here goes:
             tade.jati tanneijati taddu.re. tadvantike,
            [tadantarasya sarvasya tadu sarvasya.sya ba.hyata:]
(The . indicates dirgha, and the semi-colon, visargah.)
Would someone please direct me to a directory for transcription?
