You are mistaken, because Aryabhata is rather exceptional in the
history of Indian astronomy.  All the later scholars had a geocentric
cosmology.  Even the followeres of Aryabhata took much pains to
interprete Aryabhata's words by geocentrci view, just in order to
save the acarya from the accusation.
I wonder which Upanishad has <a clear reference to heliocentricity>.

Yes, it is certainly true!
