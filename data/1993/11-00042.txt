APPLICATIONS ARE INVITED FROM ESTABLISHED SCHOLARS for appointment to a Chair
in Religious Studies at the University of Lancaster.  Candidates with an out-
standing record of research and publication in any branch of the academic study
of religion will be considered, but preference will be given to candidates who
are able to contribute to the Department's research focus on religion in the
modern world.  It is expected that candidates will have expertise in one or
more religious traditions, Eastern or Western, and that they will be engaged
in contemporary debates about the nature and role of religion in the modern
world, whether from the perspective of the humanities or the social sciences.

The Department expects all its members to uphold its reputation as a leading
centre for teaching and research in the academic study of religion.  In addi-
tion, professorial members of the Department are expected to provide intellec-
tual leadership in their areas of academic expertise.  The appointment carries
with it no specific administrative responsibility, but the person appointed 
will be expected to take a share in the normal administrative tasks of the De-
partment.  The University is an equal opportunity employer.
