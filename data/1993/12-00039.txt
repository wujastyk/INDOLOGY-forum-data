TeX can use PS fonts.
Finally, if you can raise the money, it would be very worthwhile to
commission Yannis Haralambous <yannis at gat.univ-lille1.fr> to create an
Oriya-in-Metafont for you (and the world).  Yannis is creating a Sinhalese
Metafont for the Wellcome Institute right now: first proofs are gorgeous.
In due course it will be released at no charge for academic use.  Yannis is
also doing a Bengali at the moment, so while he is in "Indic mode" it would
be a very suitable time to commission him to make other related fonts.
Best wishes,
Dominik
