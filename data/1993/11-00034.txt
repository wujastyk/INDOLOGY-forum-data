Rosane, I was just sending you a book review. However I do agree that it

While I do not like the idea of this kind of censorship, I will certainly
refrain from posting this kind of stuff. The truth can wait. I am sure
that once the political equations in India change, many future
indology-netters will do their Ph.D on topics like this one. So these
issues will come back, while we pretend they do not exist.
