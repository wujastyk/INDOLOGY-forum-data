Etymology of the word Devalaka
Content-transfer-encoding: 7BIT
The word Devalaka was applied to a Temple Priest in olden times. I
have not seen it being used for any temple-priests these days. Does
anyone know any priests in India these days who call themselves
devalakas? Also can anyone suggest an etymology of this word?
