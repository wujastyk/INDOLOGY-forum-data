GRIERSON AND HALL WRITING
The Indian Institute Library has located examples of Grierson's and Hall's
handwriting. They are very short (both dedications) and in English. We were
unfortunately unable to find any examples of Nagari script. I have taken xerox
copies of both examples and am mailing them on,
