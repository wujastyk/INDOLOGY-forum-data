Subject: URDU EPHEMERA OFFER

          Would  any library with  an exchange and  gift relation with  the 
          Library of Congress like about  250  Urdu pamphlets from Pakistan 
          from  1960-1980,  mostly  ultra-routine  Islamic  materials   and 
          religiopolitical materials (e.g.  on  the  status  of Jerusalem). 
          These would be duplicates for  any library that had received Urdu 
          ephemera from  the cooperative acquisitions (PL480) program.   We 
          have decided that  the items in question are  too trivial for  us 
          even  to  fiche  in collections.If  the  referees  don't  object, 
          perhaps the response should go  to  the networks and  not  to  me 
          directly, so  that people  can  know they've already been claimed 
          and if they're interested know where they go.
