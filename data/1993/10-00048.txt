Reference to "Sky-gazing" in Vijnana-bhairava
Dwight Tkatschow writes :
 Tantra means technique, and the study and applications of techniques 
is technology. Quoting a modern tantric, "Science is our method, our 
aim is religion". So what I implied by my earlier post is that modern 
astronomers/scientists are modern tantrics. Tantra is technique   
oriented and not doctrinaire, and whereas tantra has been suppressed 
in India for some time, the west has seen a flowering of tantra 
(technology) in recent history. Tantra-like approaches can be found 
in many old traditions of other cultures, and hence bespeak of the 
human condition as opposed to just a particular Indian tradition
This is not to take away from the scholarly wealth of information 
Dwight has pointed towards.
