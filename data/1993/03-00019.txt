Alone in the Internet, the British JANET network uses "big-endian" 
addressing: i.e., 
    Me at universe.world.country.town.house. 
The rest of civilization uses little-endian conventions: 
    Me at house.town.country.world.universe. 
  
The above address "indinst at uk.ac.ox.vax" is in JANET big-endian format.  If 
you turn it around: "indinst at vax.ox.ac.uk" you have a proper Internet 
address which should work.  If it doesn't, then the reason is local to your 
computer or mail gateway, and not a problem with the address.  (About five 
years ago a lot of USA mail computers still didn't know about "uk" as 
an email domain: there's no excuse for that today.)

          Thanks for the several responses.  The  one that Dominik gives in 
          the  latest message, and  which several others  have  also  sent, 
          seems to work.
