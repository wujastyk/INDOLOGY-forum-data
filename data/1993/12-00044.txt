The Institute of Indology and Tamil Studies announces the release of
the first part of its Online Tamil Lexicon (OTL) on the

      Gopher Information Server at linus.informatik.uni-koeln.de.

It can be reached by typing:

"gopher linus.informatik.uni-koeln.de"

At present the OTL consists of above 130,000 entries. Included are
all the main entries in the Madras Tamil Lexicon (TL) and Supplement
(TLS), with English meanings. The OTL can be searched for ENGLISH as
well as TAMIL meanings.

The OTL will be constantly updated and expanded to include materials
from other dictionaries (Proenca, Beschi, Fabricius, Rottler, Winslow
etc.) as well as from classical and modern Tamil texts.

IMPORTANT: Read INFO.OTL first for information on Tamil transliteration
used on the gopher server. Also for further information on the scope and
uses of the OTL.
