program funded by a grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.  the program
of fellowships has been established to enable Czech, Hungarian, Polish and
Slovak scholars in the humanities and allied social sciences to carry out

pilot program will fund short-term  residencies for two to three Mellon
Research Fellows annually at each of eight designated institutes in England,
France, Germany, Greece, Italy, and the Netherlands.  The fellowships are

one of the participating institutes.  Each institute will issue its own
announcement and will and will handle all matters concerning application and
selection.  Czech, Hungarian, Polish, and Slovak scholars who wish to apply
for years 1993-1994 or 1994-1995 should obtain an announcement from their
universities or contact the participating institute directly for an
application.  Participating institutes are:
