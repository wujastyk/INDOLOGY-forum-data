Thanks to Prof. Pollock for the clarifications on the NSEP. As an Area 
Studies librarian, I would welcome any comments or reactions from list 
readers with regard to the inherent risks (as against the potential 
benefits) of seeking and using NSEP-type funding (i.e. funding 
explicitly originating in military/intelligence arms of the 
government) for the specific purpose of developing good area studies 
LIBRARY COLLECTIONS (as opposed to the study-abroad activities Prof. 
Pollock mentions). The description posted earlier included one 
category of NSEP funding, reproduced below, which would seem to 
include activities in the area of library development.

In pursuing such questions, I would be happy to help distribute to South Asia
(and other area studies) librarians the informational packet on the NSEP being
prepared by members of the Joint Committee on South Asia of the SSRC, if Prof.
Pollock thinks it is appropriate and will provide a copy to me.

Many thanks.

Thanks for your message. I will indeed provide you with the materials as
soon as we can get them ready. The JCSA of the SSRC has just concluded its
semi-annual meeting, and we are only now returning to our campuses; this
and the upcoming holiday will slow us down, alas. I am hoping we can have
materials available by the week of the 6th at the latest. I leave for India
on the 9th, and if you haven't heard from me before then, please be in
contact with Professor James Boyce, Dept. of Economics, UMass, Amherst, MA
(no email, or at least I don't have it yet). David Ludden
(DLUDDEN at PENNSAS.UPENN.EDU) will also know what is going on. One additional
person to keep in mind for further information is David Szanton, Executive
Director of International and Area Studies, UC Berkeley (tel. 510-642-5284;
you might try emailing him through ias at uclink.berkeley.edu, though that is
NOT his personal address), who is organizing a California-wide effort to
oppose participation in the NSEP.

The program you specifically call attention to is unknown to me. This was
not part of any earlier formulation of the program, and may be flash to
obscure the troubles with the rest of the package; I would have serious
doubts that it will enable library acquisitions. At all events, my prima
facie view of the matter is that *any* link between area studies and
DOD/CIA is deadly and should be avoided.

Thanks for your interest. I'll be in touch soon.
