Book notices
For those who may have missed it the last time around, I would
like to announce that a revised edition of my Religious Healing in the Veda
has appeared as Religious Medicine (New Brunswick, NJ: Transactions, 1993), and
Indian edition, Vedic Medicine, will appear shortly with MLBD. Thanks, KGZ
