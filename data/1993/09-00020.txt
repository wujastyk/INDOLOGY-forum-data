Death of Stella Kramrisch
Thank you for sending on that sad message, not as sad as Raman, as she was so
very very old, but still a great soul gone away from us.   I have many very
happy memories of being with her in Philadelphia; she was a grand girl, as
well as a most extraordinary scholar.   I will miss her very much.
