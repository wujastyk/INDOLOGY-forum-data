Can anyone out there recommend a good translation of Kampan's Ramayana
into English, other than George Hart's "Forest Book?" We are also
interested in books and articles in English about the Kampan Ramayana
but would especially like to know of any translations. All information
and/or advice will be deeply appreciated. Thanks.
