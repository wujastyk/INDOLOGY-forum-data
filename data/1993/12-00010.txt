I happen to share most of Siddharth's views, but on this point I disagree.
People like Shri Arun Shourie should definitely be allowed on panels and
*be confronted*. This is what is done in this country with all sorts of
people with obnoxious views. Done properly, it is not only a legitimate
part of the democratic process, it is also sensible way of challenging
destructive opinions.
