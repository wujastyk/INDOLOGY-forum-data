Panini's grammar and Boolean logic
 The only thing that is obvious is what you wrote ...
 Not any more sloppier than assuming Paninian grammer cannot be based 
on Boolean logic, without clearly stating why other than vague 
references to a percieved "climate". Not scholarly or scientific at 
all ... 
 What is absolute in science is method, a match between hypothesis 
and evidence; Scientific priority is value based and hence 
subjective. Therefore these statements are quite ad hominem, just as 
much as the claims they purport to debunk !
