Ja.t-asi.mhanandin's Var-a;ngacarita
Does anybody have full bibliographic information on a work by
Ja.t-asi.mhanandin (or Ja.tila, or Ja.t-ac-arya), the Var-a;ngacarita? It
is mentioned in Warder,  1930f). I would also like to know where I can
borrow a copy, preferably in Scandinavia, but if not there, anywhere.
Best regards,

The Varangacarita of Jatacarya was filmed as part of a joint U.
Chicago-HarvardProject just concluded.  You or your librarian can order a
copy from Harvard University Microreproduction Service.  The citation is as
follows (I'll leave out the diacritics; you know where they are, of course):
Jatacarya. [Varangacarita]. Jatasimhanandi viracitam Varangacarita
[microform].  Bombay: Manikacandra Digambara Jainagranthamala, 1938.
(Manikacandra Digambara Jaina granthamala, no. 40) The editor is A.N.
Upadhye.
In this and a concurrent project, about 4,000 Sanskrit titles were filmed. 
James Nye, U. of Chicago Bibliographer for Southern Asia, says that a catalog
will be forthcoming soon.
I have not checked to see if other editions of the Varangacarita exist.
