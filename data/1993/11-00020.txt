Jain commercial life
Content-Type: TEXT/plain; charset=US-ASCII
A librarian colleague and I are intrigued by a comment in Tod's ANNALS AND 
ANTIQUITIES OF RAJASTHAN, which leads us to question the veracity of Tod 
with regard to details like this. In C. A. Bayly's RULERS, TOWNSMEN, AND
BAZAARS: NORTH INDIAN SOCIETY IN THE AGE OF BRITISH EXPANSION, 1770-1870
(p.141), Bayly reports:
 "Jains were another sect which had an impact on town and commercial life
  quite out of proportion to their numbers - a mere 3-5 per cent in the 
  towns of the west, dwindling to under 1 per cent in the east.  Tod's Jain 
  clerk estimated that Jain businessmen commanded half of the total 
  commercial wealth which circulated between Rajasthan and the Bay of 
  Bengal."
Bayly cites ANNALS AND ANTIQUITIES . . .  (London, 1920) II, pp. 603-4 for
this. My colleague and I find the assertion of Tod's Jain clerk highly 
improbable. Does anyone on the net have any insights to this question? Other 
sources we should consult? Many thanks.
