The manuscripts of the Kaksaputa by Nagarjuna Siddha that I have examined
have a chapter (pa.tala) called Nidhigrahana (chapter 16 of 20), devoted to
finding treasure.
The Wellcome Institute has the following MSS of the Kaksaputa:
alpha 899 (pa.talas 1--10, part of 11)
alpha 900 (1-11, 11a, 16--20)
beta 363  (1--20)
delta 8   (1-20)
There is a printed edition, 3rd edition Calcutta 1915, ed. by Asubodha
Vidyabhusana Bhattacarya and Nityabodha Vidyaratna Bhattacarya.
