Issues in the creation and dissemination of Sanskrit e-texts
Regarding the input/typing of texts, I believe that the logic of using 
typists ignorant of Greek for the TLG project included the idea that they
would make LESS mistakes, precisely because they didn't know what they 
"should" be typing-- they only typed what they saw.
