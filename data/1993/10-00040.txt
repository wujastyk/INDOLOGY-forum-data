 In the Bud-
dhist tantric work called the "Prajnaparamita-upadesa" by the Brahmin Aryadeva
which is a seminal founding work of the "Chedika" tradition (gcod) which
only survives in Tibetan, it recommends that the practitioner "blend his
mind with the vastness of the sky". This same practice which turns up in
Kasmir Saivite texts concerned with Pratyabhijna/Trika philosophy is also a
core practice of the "Santimaha" (rdzogs-chen) and mahamudra traditions
existings in Tibet and deriving from Indian sources. It is also a practice
in some existing Nath tradi- tions of India, but I am sure it does not
pertain to astronomy. Many of the living Gurus of some of these traditions
would verify this if asked.

Thanks very much for the leads. Do you have any references to translations and
published originals of the works you cite ? I should add that I was pleasantly
surprised to find that Natha sects also practice these methods of meditatitive
star gazing. I have seen many works in their tradition without ever finding a
reference to these practices.
