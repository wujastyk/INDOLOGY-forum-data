British philosophers in India
A small group of British philosophers, three from Liverpool University
(home of indology etc), are visiting Jaipur next week for the third
Anglo-Indian Convivium, designed to bring British and Indian 
philosophers together. If anyone is interested I'll post some comments
on the experience when we get back.
