> 	Our Reflector Service is operational. There are approximately 45
> subscribers presently on the list, although this number will change
> rapidly and probably increase substantially. Let us experiment initially,
> and see where our interests take us. The traditional idea of a "reflector"
> is simple: to provide subscribers a way of telling one another of
> important programmatic events and about issues which are of interest to
> scholars, in this case, of South Asian studies. It's essentially an
> information conduit. As our interests and imaginations grow, we can add
> other "lists" for sub-groups, such as historians, anthropologists,
> political scientists, economists, folklorists, language/literature
> specialists, etc.
> 	The e-mail address of the reflector service is
> <scholars at southasia.upenn.edu>. If you send an e-mail message to that
> address, everyone on the list will receive it. Very shortly, you will be
> able to interact with our machine as if it was set up as a "listserv."
> Thus, you will be able to automatically subscribe, signoff, and send other
> house-keeping type requests regarding your account. For now, if you know
> of anyone who would like to subscribe to the reflector, they can send an
> e-mail message, requesting to be listed, to
> <scholars-request at southasia.upenn.edu>. Thank you.
