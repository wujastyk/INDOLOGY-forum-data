Elementary sanskrit.
Hello,
I would like to learn sanskrit. Could anyone recommend good "starters"
books to me..I would further like to have the intermediete level books
too..(ie., the stage next to "starters". I do have some sanskrit
vocabulary..Telugu being my native tongue.).
Thanks,
Narain Attili.
