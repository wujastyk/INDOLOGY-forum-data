On behalf of my son, Dave and myself; I extend my thanks for the
many  scholarly and informative  (not mutually exclusive) responses to
his inquiry about bahuvrihi compounds.  I think that he is reaching
the viewpoint that, in his quest to understand the structure of language,
he cannot ingore Sanskrt.
