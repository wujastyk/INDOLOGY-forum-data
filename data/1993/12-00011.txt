Tamil Ramayana
In response to Peter Banos's question about Kampan's Ramayana, there is
an article by David Shulman "Fire and Flood: The Testing of Sita in
Kampan's Iramavataram" in Paula Richman, ed. _Many Ramayanas_. Berkeley:
U of California, 1991.
He does not refer to any translation in his notes.
