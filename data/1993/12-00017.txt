          Lars, 
          Re your query on Jatasimhanandin's Varangacarita:  
          Library of Congress has  a copy of this book.  I will fax  you  a 
          copy  of   the   t.p.   etc.   Unfortunately  LC   has  suspended 
          interlibrary loans overseas, for budgetary reasons, but you could 
          request the whole book be photocopied through the                 
          Photoduplication Service,  LA123, Washington, DC  20540-5230, fax 
          (202) 707-1771.  The pagination is xiv, 88, 395 p., but  the book 
          is duodecimo, so that you can get two pages per exposure.
