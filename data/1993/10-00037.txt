I am curious now. Where can I read up more on this anomaly in Indian thought ?
I would love to get the latest scholarly (journal) references if anyone has
them, on this topic and on Indian mathematics in general.

I will dig up a copy of the Discovery of India and then by checking its
reference hunt down the Upanishadic source, and then you can let me know if you
think it is a valid point. Give me a couple of days.

Shailendra.
