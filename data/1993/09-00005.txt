RE: TEXT OF RASARATNAKARA
Hi, Dwight.  The text by Nagarjuna is the Rasendramangala, not 
Rasaratnakara. (A common error: see my article in the journal 
_Ambix_ 1984).  I have been collecting manuscripts for about a 
decade, and I now have about eight or nine.  I have a 
transcription on disk of one of them that is *extremely* 
corrupt, so much so that it is hardly worth offering you a copy 
yet.  I plan to work on the text over the next couple of years. 
If it is actually *Nityanatha's* Rasaratnakara that you are interested 
in, it has been printed in parts here and there, with varying degrees 
of quality.  There's a bibliography at the end of my 1984 article 
that lists the editions. 
Best wishes, 
Dominik

          Does  the  work  you  are editing have  a  last  chapter entitled 
          "Kaksaputa" which describes a square diagram of 16 cells (4 by 4) 
          to  be  laid  out  on  the ground  and various ingredients to  be 
          combined in various proportions to  be  laid  in  the cells?  The 
          work  Siddhanagarjunakaksaputa sometimes  has  this  for  a  last 
          chapter and I seem to recall the same work is sometimes titled or 
          mistitled Rasaratnakara.
