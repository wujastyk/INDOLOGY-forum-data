Roman Fonts
     I am currently attempting to find an ftp site where I can
download Roman fonts for transliterating the Sanskrit alphabet.  I
need these fonts to run under the Microsoft Word for Windows
environment.  If anyone in the Indology group is aware of any such
sites (and the directory and filename), please drop me a note.  My
e-mail address is: samuels at ucsu.colorado.edu
              Thanks for your help,
                       Jeff Samuels
