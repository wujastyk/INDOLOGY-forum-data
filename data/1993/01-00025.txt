Vedic accents in TeX
This question is directed to the teeming masses of people who use
TeX to typeset Sanskrit using Frans Velthuis's DNMACS: Is there any way
to get the accent marks for Vedic svarita and udatta accents? As you
know, if one doesn't print the accents correctly, the mantras won't be
efficacious, so I hope it is not necessary to sacrifice accuracy in
printing passages from the Veda.
