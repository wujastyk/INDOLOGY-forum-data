Subject: Vedic accents in TeX
Message-ID: <161227015617.23782.8749833442462189393.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

This question is directed to the teeming masses of people who use
TeX to typeset Sanskrit using Frans Velthuis's DNMACS: Is there any way
to get the accent marks for Vedic svarita and udatta accents? As you
know, if one doesn't print the accents correctly, the mantras won't be
efficacious, so I hope it is not necessary to sacrifice accuracy in
printing passages from the Veda.
