I believe GIST is now using ISCII-91 in the products it is shipping. Over here
I have a copy of the official ISCII-91 document. I have enquired about their
latest products a few weeks ago, but that is still in the snail mail system.
During my trip to India, this summer, they were not able to tell me at the
dealer in New Delhi ('the specialist was not there')

I am very much interested in the products coming up for the mac.
