2/ iass.zip
   This is a newccopy of iass.zip.  The only change is that I have
   added the file charset.ps, a PostScript version of the charset.tex
   file after processing with TeX.  This should make it more easily
   available to people with PS pri
ters (just copy the file directly
   to the printer).  There are some tricky characters in the file,
   and anyway, not everyone has TeX (extraordinarily enough).

These two files will be forwarded to the INDOLOGY listserv in due
course so that those of you without ftp can order the files by
email.

[Incidentally, you may have noticed that I am naming archives of text files
by using the first four letters of the author's name followed by the first
four letters of the title.  This is one of the search keys used by the OCLC
library cataloguing system, and it is surprisingly effective in narrowing
down the book required.]
