Help on books
the unexpectable happened: a Xerox copy of an article of a Festschrift
I could not get otherwise was sent to my address.
Thank you out there!
Even if this first attempt led to success we should not be tempted to
overdo it. First try all the regular foreign loans. Then INDOLOGY.
Asking for help with regard to an article/contribution is certainly
easier than searching for a some-hundred-pages-cum-plates book.
Still, an additional aim for INDOLOGY seems to be found.
