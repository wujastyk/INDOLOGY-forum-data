Thank you for the information about Chiwrite and its current problems with
networking. Short of adopting an entirely new progam for my project, it
appears that conversion to Kyoto-Harvard scheme might be the best way
to go. Could someone give me more information about the Kyoto-Harvard 
scheme. How it works in my case and where to obtain a copy of it.
Thanks. 
K.G. Zysk
