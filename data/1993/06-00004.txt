Sharing Chi-Writer-based texts
Thank you for the information about Chiwrite and its current problems with
networking. Short of adopting an entirely new progam for my project, it
appears that conversion to Kyoto-Harvard scheme might be the best way
to go. Could someone give me more information about the Kyoto-Harvard 
scheme. How it works in my case and where to obtain a copy of it.
Thanks. 
K.G. Zysk
