I am rather fond of the Bod. (I even used to have a wonderful etching of it in
my study -- now gifted to a young friend of mine, who took a fancy to it when
he was ten years of age.)
But it was indeed rather odd that its references were organized largely by
pasting labels in books. It boggled the mind. (The amount of repasting would
increase exponentially with the size of the collection.) I wonder why they
*ever* used books ? But then I never understood why my friends had to sign
copyright forms for 14th century material either. Perhaps someone can explain.
That, in any case, was what I had in mind. 
The India Insititue of course was another matter altogether. It had a card
catalogue, for one thing. I have memories of many pleasant hours spent there.
