In response to Shailendra Mehta's post (we can take this off list very
soon, but maybe others would like to comment):

Yes, the apparent gap between life and philosophy was discussed (and
a paper on Rousseau read by Tim O'Hagan - unfortunately the Indians present
seemed not to want to discuss him!). Rousseau's excuse was that he would
have made a lousy father: I did raise the question why in that case he
was so sure that he wasn't a lousy adviser to fathers! Coincidentally,
the connection between life and philosophy was also discussed at a
Royal Institute of Philosophy conference in (you guessed) Liverpool two
years ago and published as *Philosophy, Religion and the Spiritual Life*,
ed.M.McGhee. It's perhaps also relevant that of the 9 British philosophers
6 are vegetarians, on philosophical grounds - so some of us, at least,
do believe in uniting theory and practice. The ones who weren't are also
more than technicians, even if none of us quite dare to call ourselves
philosophers in the strong, Epictetan sense.

Jaipur was a great relief after Delhi. I could almost imagine living there!
I understand that the University Philosophy dept would be interested in 
hiring someone to teach Greek philosophical texts, with a knowledge of
Greek.
