Two questions
Dear Raj,
You may find the following book helpful if you are looking for descriptions of
armour:-
Singh, Sarva Daman
Ancient Indian warfare with special reference to the Vedic period.
Leiden : Brill, 1965.
It has a good chapter on Arms and Armour and a bibliography which may give you
some pointers to other works. I have only used it to look up about archery but
I am sure it will contain some information about body armour,
Best wishes,
Gillian Evison.
