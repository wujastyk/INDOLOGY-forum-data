history of Indian astronomy/astrology
Some of you might have already got a mail from me personally requesting
references on the subject of history of Indian astronomy/astrology. I 
would like to add that I already used the ISIS bibliographies which have 
provided me with some resources necessary for my study. 
What I am looking for is a perspective different from that of David Pingree!
And also, some material that treats the matter more from the Astrology side 
rather than Astronomy/Mathematics side. Most of the references I already
have is for the latter.
Also, do you know of any sites/archives which would have english translations 
of the primary sources that you think could be of help to me? :-)
Thanks again
Suresh Madhu
