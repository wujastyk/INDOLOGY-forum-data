outline fonts and encodings

  righto; virtually any environment ( ? except X-windows ?) which will

  truetype.  I suspect that until unicode (a 'real' character set---except it
  doesn't support CSX) arrives in force, anyone with odd character tastes
  is going to need to keep font manipulation utilities at hand because there
  will be no across the board solutions.
