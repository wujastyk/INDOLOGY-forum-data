You shouldn't be sorry at all.  I stupidly left the file there, forgetting
that the network is open to all.  I hope to make it available in a more
conspicuous place before the end of the summer.
 
You've found (and produced !) some really useful software and data for the
Indologist listeners.  Please don't let this discourage you in any way.
I'm only worried that software which I know to be "not right" might drift
into usage, where I know how to fix it.
