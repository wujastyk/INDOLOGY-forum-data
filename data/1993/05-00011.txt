The rules governing the use of the Internet are very strict in forbidding
any commercial use of the net, *especially advertising*.  While the above

of trouble.  INDOLOGY might have to close down.
So please, be careful about this sort of thing.  There are ways of
mentioning commercial services and products en passant which let
everyone know about them without blatantly advertising.
