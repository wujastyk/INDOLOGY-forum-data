MAGIC SQUARES
          Is  there anyone out there interested in  magic squares in India? 
          I  have collected a large number of sources in  print and  MS  in 
          Sanskrit, Prakrit,  and vernaculars.  The  late  Schuyler Cammaan 
          published two articles and  also  did further researches he never 
          published.  I  discovered from  an  ephemera bibliography of  Dr. 
          Mahdihassan of  the  Hamdard Institute in  Karachi  that  he  has 
          published a  number of articles on  the subject.  "Magic squares" 
          means  not  just  any  yantra  or talisman but  square arrays  of 
          numbers such that any column, row,  or diagonal yields a constant 
          sum.  There are  also  other "magic" figures such  a hegagonal or 
          star  shaped arrays.   By extension other numerical yantras  fall 
          into the same area  of folkloristic investigation.  My impression 
          is that in  the Indian context the Jains have done the  most work 
          with   them  mathematically.   Several  major  Jain   hymns   are 
          associated with  magic squares and  I  have  noted  that  in  the 
          printed books and magical MSS  from  Jains  the numbers work  out 
          right far more often than in the Hindu ones.  Of course, both the 
          magical and  the mathematical aspects of  these things have  been 
          intensively cultivated in the Islamic world.
