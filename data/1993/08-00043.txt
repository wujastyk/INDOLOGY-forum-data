anonymous FTP and from two sites. From NIC.CERF.NET, cd
to cerfnet/cefnet_info and retrieve files called:

internet-accessible-catalog-nov90-general.ps (Postscript)
internet-accessible-catalog-nov90.txt (ascii)

You can also FTP to ARIEL.UNM.EDU and cd to library.
The files are called:

library.ps (Postscript)
internet.library (ascii)

It is possible to automatically receive updated versions of
this file. For more information, send mail or a command to
your nearest Listserv node or, only as a last resort, to
Listserv at unmvm. The body of the mail or the command should
say INFO AFD.  You will be sent a file called Listafd Memo
which describes the automatic file distribution feature
of the Revised Listserv.


As always, if you have any questions about the List or suggestions
for additions or corrections, please send mail to stgeorge at unmb
or stgeorge at bootes.unm.edu.

I might add, that for those of you with access to a gopher server, I
searched 'gopherspace' with the key words 'library catalogs' (NB US
spelling of catalogue) and turned up dozens of search facilities,
announcements (including the one above), direct access to on-line
catalogues etc. Of them all I have only ever seen and used St George and
Larsen's document, but that contains enough information to keep me going
for the next few years!

I would also endorse Dominik's endorsement of Ed Krol's book ("The Whole
Internet"); Krol explains clearly and simply the arcane mysteries of
gopher, WAIS, ftp, email, and much more in a way that any humanities
scholar should find easy to understand. A word of warning though: he
assumes one starts one's electronic journeys from a unix machine and if
that is not your case you may need to find someone who understands your
system to get you started.
