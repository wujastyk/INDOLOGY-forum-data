I can't provide any sources at the moment, but it is certainly a remark
with the ring of stereotype about it - I have read modern secondary sources
citing older works which make exactly the same point about the Parsis in
the early 19th century; indeed, in one case I was struck by the similarity
of phrasing (I think Tod says something like 'half the wealth...passes
through the hands...').
