Kalidasa and the Agnimitra problem
Dear Professor Kak,
 I am a student of EE but the study of history is a hobby of mine. I find your
articles very interesting and thought-provoking. Since you kindly offered to 
mail copies of your above-mentioned publication, I am taking the liberty of
requesting you for one. Of course, only if you have it in electronic form
and it is not too much trouble for you.
 THanking you and looking forward to reading about Kalidasa.
