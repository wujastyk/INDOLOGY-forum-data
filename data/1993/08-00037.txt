John S. Quarterman's book "The Matrix: computer networks and conferencing
systems worldwide" (Digital PREss, 1990; ISBN 1-55558-033-5) has a section
on networks in South Asia (chapter 17).

You can get more up-to-date information using the "whois" command in Unix.
I append info on this, and on the result of using it to get info. on sites
in Delhi.

To answer the question, though: no, not to my knowledge.

=== whois.1 =======================================================
     Online Email directory of ERNET users in India (maintained on sangam)

     The whois program examines a central database of registered users  and,
     based on a user supplied search key, looks up and displays information
     about all selected users. Display is always truncated to fifty lines.
     The command
       whois -h sangam.ncst.ernet.in help
     gets you a copy of this document.

SEARCH KEYS
     All searches are case-insensitive. When searching the database  with  a
     name  key,  you can  use a few  characters  of the  name instead of the
     entire word.  This is handy if you are not sure of the exact spelling.

     A search key consists of a single word or group of words  contained  in
     (double) quotes (" ... "). The single word form matches city name.

     whois -h sangam.ncst.ernet.in bombay    (Lists ernet sites in Bombay)
     whois -h sangam.ncst.ernet.in mad       (All the Madras sites !)

     Queries using the form key at site will
     match user's login name or full name as in /etc/passwd  file.

     whois -h sangam.ncst.ernet.in joshi at shakti      (All users on shakti matching
                                                 the pattern 'joshi')

     The use of the symbol % in front of a name limits the search
     to the field containing the login name. Eg:

     whois -h sangam.ncst.ernet.in %sadanand at shakti
     (only logins starting with 'sadanand' at shakti)

     This will fail to match P Sadanandan, whose login name is ps

     Directory outputs associate a mailid with each user, for further
     enquiry, to retrieve full postal address, phone and Fax numbers.
     For example, sh287 is the mailid of PKX Thomas as shown below.

(sh287) thomas:(Mr. P.K.X. Thomas,NCST,,) <thomas at shakti.ernet.in>

     Use !mailid for getting detailed information.

     whois -h sangam.ncst.ernet.in !sh287
     (Gives postal address, Phone & Fax numbers of Thomas)
                    (C-Shell users must use \! instead of !)
