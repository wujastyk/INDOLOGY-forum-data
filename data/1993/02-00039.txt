Two questions
I'd appreciate pointers/help with a couple of things I've wanted to track down
for a while:
1. Is there any published genealogy/lineology, albeit incomplete and fragmented,
of the characters in Indian mythology?
2. Are there any English descriptions/sketches of the metallic
ornamentation/armor worn by men in ancient India in the upper arms and chest?
Thanks,
Raj Sehgal
