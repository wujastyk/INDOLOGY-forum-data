Chiwriter to TeX
Ken,
I noticed that the Chiwriter to TeX program is freely available on the net.
Try the site ftp.tex.ac.uk, in directory pub/tex-archive/support, I think.
The site ftp.tex.ac.uk supports Gopher, and that gives you easy access and
searching.  I had a brief look at one of the docs for the program, and it
looked as though it was highly configurable, and could deal with fonts
intelligently.  You may be in luck.
