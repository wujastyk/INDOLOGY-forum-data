outline fonts and encodings
Can you please explain why setting the font as symbol or OEM  would "torch 
it" for Windows? I have gone bonkers trying to get my good 'ole HP bitmap 
fonts to work with Windows, precisely because of the re-mapping to ANSI 
that takes place (I see the correct character on screen but it PRINTS a 
character mapped from the ANSI set. Tho I have pretty much put the project 
aside, I had figured that if I set the font as OEM it would no longer 
perform the helpful!!@#$#$ re-mapping.
By the by, I have also had the same experience trying to take PC Word 
Perfect documents to Word Perfect on the Mac-- those damn friendly machines 
re-map for you. I can imagine that for some folks it actually works (given 
that a French accent, say, is in a different upper ASCII slot in the PC 
Roman 8 character set than whatever the Mac uses), but it drove me nuts. 
Again, I simply gave up. Perhaps if somebody understands the mapping a 
table could be devised to translate the translated text!
