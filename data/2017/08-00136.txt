[INDOLOGY] Gita 13.6
There is yet another classification in Bh G:
Two Purushas classification.
???????? ?????? ???? ???????????? ?? ? ?
????? ??????? ?????? ????????????? ?????? ? 15\-16?
In creation, there are two Purushas. 1. Kshara = perishable ; 2. akshara =
imperishable
The portion made up of all the creatures (living and non-living ) is called
the Kshara Purusha; The *locus mundi * of all the creatures is called the
Akshara Purusha.
The second one, the location of all the creatures,  is only inferred from
the existence of the creatures. All the creatures are Vyakta. Their *l**ocus
mundi *is avyakta.
*---------------------------------------------------------------------------------*
In modern times, (particularly in Physics and Chemistry or Physical
Sciences), Creation is divided into Matter and Energy.
Matter is manifest. Energy is unmanifest while its effects are manifest.
To use the Bh G terms , we can say, Matter is vyakta. Energy is avyakta
while its effects are vyakta.
BhG's vyakta-avyakta classification of creation is similar to but not the
same as this.
