The most original interpretation of this famous passage is by the late Ronald Morton Smith.
"What Was One's Own Language? Vinaya 2.139". The article can be found in
Contacts between Cultures: South Asia 2 (Selected Papers  from the 33rd International Congress
of Asian and North African  Studies (Toronto, Aigust 15-25, 1990). Ed. by  K.L. Koppedrayer,
Lewiston 1992, pp, 240-241
