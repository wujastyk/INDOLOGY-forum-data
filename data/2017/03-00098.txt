The most original interpretation of this famous passage is by the late Ronald Morton Smith.
"What Was One's Own Language? Vinaya 2.139". The article can be found in
Contacts between Cultures: South Asia 2 (Selected Papers  from the 33rd International Congress
of Asian and North African  Studies (Toronto, Aigust 15-25, 1990). Ed. by  K.L. Koppedrayer,
Lewiston 1992, pp, 240-241

In fact, Buddha always insisted on delivering his teachings in Ardha-Magadhi Prakrit ,which was
the local vernacular in around Magadha.
