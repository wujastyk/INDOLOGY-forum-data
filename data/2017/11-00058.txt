Another significant aspect she might want to focus on is "textualism" by
which I mean:  to conclude about the reality outside the texts, purely on
the basis of words in the texts.

In other words apart from the connections /interface / comparison / study
of relative significance - between oral and written texts, a similar focus
on connections /interface / comparison / study of relative significance -
between texts and the reality of life, rituals, and other facts also needs
to be taken up.
