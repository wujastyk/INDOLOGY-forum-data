[INDOLOGY]  Mango miracle (Re:  Fwd: Request for subscription
There is also in the Divy?vad?na, in the A?oka legend cycle, the story of the Gift of the Half Mango (pp. 430-32 ed. Cowell - Neil: https://archive.org/stream/pts_divyvadnacol_3720-0688#page/n445/mode/2up , here = ? same text as Kuma?rala?ta's Kalpana?man?d?itika? Dr?s?t?a?ntapan?kti, ed. L?ders pp. 149-150). I suppose that the text is translated by J. S. Strong in The Legend of King A?oka: A study and translation of the A?ok?vad?na, Princeton UP, 1983, Delhi: Motilal (Buddhist Tradition series 6), 1989. I do not think that the translation is in J. Tatelman, The Heavenly Exploits: Buddhist biographies from the D?vyavad?na, vol. 1, New York, The Clay Sanskrit Library, 2005 ; but maybe it will be in A. Rotman, Divine Stories: Divy?vad?na, Part 2, Boston: Wisdom Publications (Classics of Indian Buddhism series), 2017  (Part 1 issued in 2008).

First thing which comes to my mind is the well-known story of the "Mango miracle" which the 12th cent. Periya Pur??am attributes to K?raikk?l Ammaiy?r (one of the 63 Tamil Shaiva saints, who may have lived in the 6th century.
See the pointer to a popular modern retelling of the story (as a movie)
