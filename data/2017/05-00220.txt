The theory that idol worship in Hinduism is a borrowing from the idol
worship in Buddhism, if already made, or if can be made, leads to very
interesting theoretical consequences: one of them being that the aspect of
Hinduism that is attacked by all the anti-idolatory religions and all the
anti-idolatry reformationist 'progressive' modern religious movements is
borrowed into Hinduism from a cultural tradition that is liked by many
modern 'progressive' movements for the 'progressive' aspects in it.
