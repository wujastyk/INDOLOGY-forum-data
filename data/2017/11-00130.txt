Subject: [INDOLOGY] Contacts at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangahalaya and Bharat Kala Bhavan
Message-ID: <CAHRgzy2Hhg5a=6LSPeqSu3pMbzqfg3CDyWzLUmuEC887E44KSg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear colleagues,

Would anyone happen to know of the appropriate contact(s) at either
the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangahalaya (formerly Prince of Wales
museum) or the Bharat Kala Bhavan museum at Banaras Hindu University, for
researchers wishing to view items in the collection? In both cases, this
would be in regard to viewing manuscripts in their collections. I've
located the directories for the institutions, but would be grateful for any
suggestion from those who have actually worked at either in the past.

Thank you in advance for any suggestions,
