[INDOLOGY] Skt vocabulary from the title pages and prefaces of Sanskrit editions
You seem to use Editing as an umbrella term for many different aspects of a
pre-publishing work, which in your opinion include s'odhana etc. Fine, even
then the student might need to know the specific sub aspect of editing that
is intended to be communicated in a given specific context.
