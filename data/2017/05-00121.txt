[INDOLOGY] BACHASPATI MISRA'S BHAMATI
The specification ?P?ter-D?niel Sz?nt? via INDOLOGY ? should not have been there in my last post. I had erased that part of the address which appeared on my computer screen when I typed ?Indology? in the ?To? field. However, as the post left my computer, the erased part seems to have again appeared in the address.  This time I am using the ?Edit Address? command of my email browser and hoping that the individual specification ?P?ter-D?niel Sz?nt? via INDOLOGY? does not appear in the address. Apologies to Das and Sz?nt?.
