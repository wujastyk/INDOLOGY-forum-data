Dear Friends, I have a student who is focused very intently on Ny?ya and
pram??av?da, who is getting ready to take his first trip to India to study
with a traditional Pandit. Whom would people recommend especially for this
discipline? I know of some Pandits who are all very capable in Ny?ya, but I
wonder if there are Pandits you might know of with an especial passion for
the topic. Best,??????,J
