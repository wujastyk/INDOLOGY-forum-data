=?utf-8?Q?Re:_[INDOLOGY]_Question_regarding_=C4=80c=C4=81rya=C5=9B=C4=81pa?=
When I wrote in my second post:
(without having checked what Kane ? or possibly David ? says thereabout) I made this conjecture on the sole basis of Burnell's statement ( https://archive.org/stream/ordinancesofmanu00manu#page/n55/mode/2up ) pointed out by Madhav: 
"And in Malabar, Cochin and Travancore this [= the fact that "even among South Indian Brahmans numberless usual practices are opposed to the Sanskrit law"] is so much the case, that a small manual called the An?c?ranir?aya has been composed to enumerate them ? fn: This tract is attributed to ?a?kara of course (...)"
Since no Kerala manuscript appears to bear this title. 
Now in checking dharma texts entitled ?c?ra?, ?c?rasa?graha?, keral?c?rasa?graha?, found in catalogues, I came across a short tract entitled ?c?ranir?aya or Keral?c?ranir?aya ascribed to ?a?kar?carya (several MSS. in the KUML, apparently described in the Descr. Cat. Curator's Office Library as the no. 371B, i.e. in vol. 2 1938, unfortunately not at hand) which must correspond to Burnell's reference and deserves to be more closely regarding the Kerala? an?c?ras.
Best wishes,
C
PS: correct the typo in my very first post (already giving the references usefully repeated by Parpola and Olivelle): "the Laghudharmaprak??ik? attributed to one ?a?kara [not ???kara], also known as ???karasm?ti."
