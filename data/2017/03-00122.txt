Dear Palaniappan,

You are right about ??vara being referred to in plural, but there is
already an example of such ??varas in the same section of verses. See
10.33.30:




*naitat sam?caret j?tu manas?pi hi an??vara?vina?yaty ?caran mau?hy?d
yath?rudro ?bdhi-ja? vi?am*

One who is not ??vara (an??vara?) should never imitate the behavior of
??varas, even mentally. If out of foolishness an ordinary person does
imitate such behavior, he will simply destroy himself, just as a person who
is not Rudra would destroy himself if he tried to drink an ocean of poison.

In the Telugu translation of Bhagavatam of Potana (late 1400s), there is a
mention of candra (moon) and v?sava (indra) as examples of ??varas, in
addition to Rudra as mentioned above.

Here are corresponding verses from the Telugu version:

10.1-1106 (Translation of 10.33.29)
*sarvabhak?u? ?agni sarvambu bhak?i?cid??ig?ni pagidi d??a maina?j?si
d??apadamu? jendaru t?jasvulagu?a? jandra v?sav?du? ladhipa!*

Meaning: As all-devouring fire remains unpolluted even after consuming
everything, the same the spirited-people (t?jasvi+lu) such as *candra *(moon)
and *v?sava *(indra) remain untainted for their transgressions.

10.1-1107 (translation of: SB 10.33.30)
*??varu??u g?niv???u na-r??vara! parak?nta? dala?ci ye?lu braduku?
gau-r??varu??u dakka nanyu??uvi?vabhayadavi?amu mri?gi velaya?gala????*

Meaning: O King (nar??vara), how can anyone who is not ??vara survive
touching other men's wives? Only Gauri's ??vara (husband of Gauri) can
drink the dreadful poison and survive.

Clearly, the attempt in these verses is to justify Krishna's
transgressions. Whether Krishna is treated as an *??vara *(Lord) or a
*param**?**?vara *(Supreme Lord), these verses are all about how their
apparent sinful actions are unimpeachable.

Almost reminds us of Nixon's quote: "when the president does it, that means
it is not illegal." Did Nixon read BhP? :-)

I still believe your attempt to connect ??varas in these verses with ??v?rs is
far-fetched.

Regards,
Suresh.
