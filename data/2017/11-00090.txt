Dear Karl-Stephan,

I'm not sure if somebody else might have mentioned it already but another
article that may be useful is:

Qvarnstr?m, Olle. "Haribhadra and the Beginnings of Doxography in India."
In *Approaches to Jaina Studies: Philosophy, Logic, Rituals and Symbols*,
edited by N. K. Wagle and Olle Qvarnstr?m, 169-210. Toronto: The Centre for
South Asian Studies, 1999.

I hope this helps.
