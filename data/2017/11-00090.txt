[INDOLOGY] (no subject)
Dear Karl-Stephan,
I'm not sure if somebody else might have mentioned it already but another
article that may be useful is:
Qvarnstr?m, Olle. "Haribhadra and the Beginnings of Doxography in India."
In *Approaches to Jaina Studies: Philosophy, Logic, Rituals and Symbols*,
edited by N. K. Wagle and Olle Qvarnstr?m, 169-210. Toronto: The Centre for
South Asian Studies, 1999.
I hope this helps.
