[INDOLOGY] Pippalagrama of the Nikumbha king?
Thank you, Ashok. Yes, I am familiar with this use of eka -- in fact, 
another author I am working on (Teja?si?ha) is partial to it, using 
expressions like sadgu?aughaikap?tram and saukhyaikap?tram. The example 
you mention is perhaps from this verse used by ?r?vai??avas?
yo nityam acyutapad?mbujayugmarukmavy?mohatas taditar??i t???ya mene |
asmadguror bhagavato 'sya dayaikasindho r?m?nujasya cara?au ?ara?a? 
prapadye ||
But to return to Tuka Jyotirvid, regardless of whether we translate his 
phrase literally as 'one' or as 'peerless' etc., I do get the feeling 
that he had a particular Nikumbha ruler in mind. I thought that perhaps 
there might be someone associated with the founding of one or more 
settlements, possibly in Maharashtra.
