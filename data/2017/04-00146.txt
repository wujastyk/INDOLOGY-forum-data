[INDOLOGY] Female name Bhaayi?
I see no problem with the manuscript reading 
?r?vatsa-sa?j??d dvija-pu?gav?d ya? ?r?-bh?yi-n?mn? su?uve ca s?dhv? |
?r?-y?davena vyarac?ha tena sudh?-nidhis t?jika-yoga-p?rva? ||
(but I do see a problem with David Pingree, a scholar I respect very much, if there are other instances of him emending texts as in the present case).
The author Y?dava/?r?y?dava is simply telling us that an eminent brahmin named ?r?vatsa was his father and an honorable woman ?r?-b?? (to use our present-day standard spelling) was his mother. Names like Lak?m?-b??, T?r?-b??, Ahaly?-b?? were commonly heard in his time and in his part of the world (cf. Dr. Nagaraj Paturi: ??r?b?? /?r?b?i / ?r?b?y is a very much possible female personal name.?). On the whole, scholars were not as strict about the writing of non-Sanskrit words as they were about the writing of Sanskrit words (note, for example, the way the g?th?s are quoted and accepted in K?vya-??stra works). It was not unusual to write the non-Sanskrit words as one heard them or as the metre required; approximation was acceptable. Therefore the writing of (our expected) b?? as bh?y? or bh?yi need not be viewed as presenting a serious problem. (again. cf. Paturi: ?Shortening of the end vowel is not a hurdle ??)
The ?ca? in the second quarter of the verse initially bothered me, but there could be justification for it in a preceding verse of the section, if .
