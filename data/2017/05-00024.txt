[INDOLOGY] devanagari in latex using an emacs editor
Dear colleagues,
Might someone on the list point me to where I can find out how to put, 
at a minimum, Devanagari numerals into a Latex document using an emacs 
editor? The more elementary the exposition the better.
Cordially yours,
Brendan Gillon
