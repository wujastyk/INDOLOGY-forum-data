[INDOLOGY] Buddhasrijnana's Abhisamaya commentary
Dear colleagues,
Please allow me to indulge in this list today.
Rahul Sankrtyayan in his 1935 report wrote that he had seen and
photographed a 27-folio ms. of Buddha?r?j??na's Abhisamay?la?k?ra
commentary in Lhasa.
Does anyone know what became of these photos? They do not seem to be kept
in the G?ttingen collection (I checked Bandurski's catalogue relatively
thoroughly).
I'd be grateful for any information.
Best wishes,
Peter Szanto
