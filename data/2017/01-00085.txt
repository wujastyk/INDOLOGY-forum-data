Dear Paolo,

ask Peter-Daniel Szanto (All Souls College in Oxford). He wrote an excellent thesis on the Catu?p??ha. He discusses the problem of these four p??has in the introductory section of his theses and shows how Sircar misunderstood the matter. If I remember well, Peter says that it's not clear why four chapters of the CP are so called (?tma, para, yoga, guhya) and that these names do not correspond to the content of particular chapters.

Regarding the chronology, according to Peter CP is older than Hevajratantra, but to date HT to "between seventh and middle of eighth centuries" seems to be to early.

Best,
Lubomir
