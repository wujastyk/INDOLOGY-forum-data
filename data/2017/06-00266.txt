[INDOLOGY] Question on the word "purapati"
Hello all,
I have recently been puzzling over the Palam Baoli inscription from the
13th of August, 1276 CE. I am particularly interested in the term purapati
as it appears in this verse:
*?r?yogan?puram iti prathit?bhidh?ne *
*?hill?pure purapati suk?t? vabh?va |*
*?r?m?n a?e?agu?ar??ir apetado?o*
*dh?m?n udattamatir u??haran?madheya? ||13||*
Prasad translates it as "householder" in *The Inscriptions of the Delhi
Sultanate.* I was wondering if anything further could be said of the term,
or if anyone had seen this term in other inscriptions.
Any leads would be appreciated!
Thanks,
Luther Obrock
