[INDOLOGY] Devanagari and OS 10.12.6
Dear colleagues,
Are there any Apple users among us who have experienced problems inputing
Devanagari while using the Chrome web browser since installing OS 10.12.6
(Sierra)? The problem seems to be limited to typing conjuncts in this one
application (but I'd be curious to hear if others are encountering other
problems). Chrome automatically sets to uft-8 encoding, so the problem is
somewhere else.
Thanks,
