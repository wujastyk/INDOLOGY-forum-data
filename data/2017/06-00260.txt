Subject: [INDOLOGY] DLI website status?
Message-ID: <C37A0CD7-0FDB-4902-B630-85DA62C6A717@columbia.edu>

Greetings all,

    Does anyone know what the status of the DLI ("Digital Library of India") website is? If or when it will come back online? 

http://www.new.dli.ernet.in/

It has been down for weeks (months?) with nothing but a message about "upgrades".

Thanks,
