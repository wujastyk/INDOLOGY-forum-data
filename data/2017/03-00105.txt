Palaniappan,
Swami Prabhup?da's explanation of the word *??vara *as 'Lord?s empowered
servants' is pretty dubious here. 10.33.31 should be seen in the context of
the original question (10.33.26-27) on how *??vara, *the Lord of the
Universe -- who is the the original speaker, the executor, and the
protector of the laws -- could violate the same laws/rules.
SB 10.33.29:
*?r?-?uka uv?ca*
*dharma-vyatikramo d???a*
* ??var???? ca s?hasam*
*tej?yas?? na do??ya*
* vahne? sarva-bhujo yath?*
The answer is that  the status of *??vara* is not harmed by any apparently
audacious transgression of morality we may see in them, for they are just
like fire, which devours everything fed into it and remains unpolluted
(10.33.29).
SB 10.33.31
??var???? vaca? satya?
tathaiv?carita? kvacit
te??? yat sva-vaco-yukta?
buddhim??s tat sam?caret
The statements of the Lord are always true, and the acts they perform are
exemplary when consistent with those statements. Therefore one who is
intelligent should carry out those instructions.
There is no reason to doubt that ??var???? in 10.33.31 in any way refers
to devotee or a servant of the Lord, and cannot make a case of any
relationship with the Tamil *??v?r/??v?r *variation.
Regards,
Suresh.
