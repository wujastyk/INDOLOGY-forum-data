Thank you Christophe. I stand corrected regarding the name K?yakku?i. Here is the location of the village Achamthavilthan https://www.google.com/maps/place/Achamthavilthan,+Tamil+Nadu+626137,+India/@9.3406345,77.5745443,13.98z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x3b06c40d59b23ce7:0xefcca7727b8ad986!8m2!3d9.4368458!4d77.6643502 <https://www.google.com/maps/place/Achamthavilthan,+Tamil+Nadu+626137,+India/@9.3406345,77.5745443,13.98z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x3b06c40d59b23ce7:0xefcca7727b8ad986!8m2!3d9.4368458!4d77.6643502>. 
The river K?yakku?i is not marked in the map, even at maximum zooming. (In contrast, one can see Vaippar can be seen further to the south.) But the satellite map shows a possible dry bed with potential water flows when there is heavy rain on the mountains to the west of Rajapalaiyam. Also see http://wikimapia.org/#lang=en&lat=9.466122&lon=77.574162&z=15&m=b&show=/19005235/?????????-??? <http://wikimapia.org/#lang=en&lat=9.466122&lon=77.574162&z=15&m=b&show=/19005235/%E0%AE%95%E0%AE%BE%E0%AE%AF%E0%AE%95%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%95%E0%AF%81%E0%AE%9F%E0%AE%BF-%E0%AE%86%E0%AE%B1%E0%AF%81>.
It is really surprising that such an insignificant river (probably unknown to people from outside the immediate area) is mentioned by a person from a far-away Tiruvi?aimarut?r. (One source says Dak?i??vartan?tha is from Tiruvala?cu?i near Kumpak??am. See https://books.google.com/books?id=70uvBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT37&lpg=PT37&dq=Dak?i??vartan?tha&source=bl&ots=fJgek3fYnA&sig=IuQZUkdGSskYUIqSsIMN43p3VXU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiXnqHGtYPWAhWj6oMKHRveCIIQ6AEIRTAH#v=onepage&q=Dak?i??vartan?tha&f=false <https://books.google.com/books?id=70uvBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT37&lpg=PT37&dq=Dak%E1%B9%A3i%E1%B9%87%C4%81vartan%C4%81tha&source=bl&ots=fJgek3fYnA&sig=IuQZUkdGSskYUIqSsIMN43p3VXU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiXnqHGtYPWAhWj6oMKHRveCIIQ6AEIRTAH#v=onepage&q=Dak%E1%B9%A3i%E1%B9%87%C4%81vartan%C4%81tha&f=false> ) If the name K?yakku?i is indeed mentioned in the commentary, and if Dak?i??vartan?tha?s place is still open, a possible candidate is Tiruppu?aimarut?r, the southern ?arjuna? location. (See https://www.google.com/maps/@9.8155248,77.8396093,8.27z <https://www.google.com/maps/@9.8155248,77.8396093,8.27z>)
One source dates Dak?i??vartan?tha to 12th century. See https://books.google.com/books?id=9P3lDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA118&lpg=PA118&dq=Dak?i??vartan?tha&source=bl&ots=6hFyoz8A9b&sig=XbHCimb93_96S5HpUkD63FXetXk&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjdqvSko4PWAhUB7oMKHf5OBUcQ6AEIRzAH#v=onepage&q=Dak?i??vartan?tha&f=false <https://books.google.com/books?id=9P3lDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA118&lpg=PA118&dq=Dak%E1%B9%A3i%E1%B9%87%C4%81vartan%C4%81tha&source=bl&ots=6hFyoz8A9b&sig=XbHCimb93_96S5HpUkD63FXetXk&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjdqvSko4PWAhUB7oMKHf5OBUcQ6AEIRzAH#v=onepage&q=Dak%E1%B9%A3i%E1%B9%87%C4%81vartan%C4%81tha&f=false>. In the 12th century, the P???iyas were in Madurai. Even if Dak?i??vartan?tha lived in the 14th or 15th century, there was no headquarters of the P???iyas on the K?yakku?i river. Two places associated with the P???iyas were Ukkira? K???ai (https://www.google.com/maps/@9.8155248,77.8396093,8.27z <https://www.google.com/maps/@9.8155248,77.8396093,8.27z>) and Te?k?ci (https://www.google.com/maps/@9.8155248,77.8396093,8.27z <https://www.google.com/maps/@9.8155248,77.8396093,8.27z>) Both are nowhere near the K?yakku?i river.
I think this K?yakku?i river is a red herring as far as identifying Uraga is concerned.
