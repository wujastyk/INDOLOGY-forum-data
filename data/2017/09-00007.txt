Thank you Christophe. I stand corrected regarding the name K?yakku?i. Here is the location of the village Achamthavilthan https://www.google.com/maps/place/Achamthavilthan,+Tamil+Nadu+626137,+India/@9.3406345,77.5745443,13.98z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x3b06c40d59b23ce7:0xefcca7727b8ad986!8m2!3d9.4368458!4d77.6643502 <https://www.google.com/maps/place/Achamthavilthan,+Tamil+Nadu+626137,+India/@9.3406345,77.5745443,13.98z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x3b06c40d59b23ce7:0xefcca7727b8ad986!8m2!3d9.4368458!4d77.6643502>. 

The river K?yakku?i is not marked in the map, even at maximum zooming. (In contrast, one can see Vaippar can be seen further to the south.) But the satellite map shows a possible dry bed with potential water flows when there is heavy rain on the mountains to the west of Rajapalaiyam. Also see http://wikimapia.org/#lang=en&lat=9.466122&lon=77.574162&z=15&m=b&show=/19005235/?????????-??? <http://wikimapia.org/#lang=en&lat=9.466122&lon=77.574162&z=15&m=b&show=/19005235/%E0%AE%95%E0%AE%BE%E0%AE%AF%E0%AE%95%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%95%E0%AF%81%E0%AE%9F%E0%AE%BF-%E0%AE%86%E0%AE%B1%E0%AF%81>.

It is really surprising that such an insignificant river (probably unknown to people from outside the immediate area) is mentioned by a person from a far-away Tiruvi?aimarut?r. (One source says Dak?i??vartan?tha is from Tiruvala?cu?i near Kumpak??am. See https://books.google.com/books?id=70uvBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT37&lpg=PT37&dq=Dak?i??vartan?tha&source=bl&ots=fJgek3fYnA&sig=IuQZUkdGSskYUIqSsIMN43p3VXU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiXnqHGtYPWAhWj6oMKHRveCIIQ6AEIRTAH#v=onepage&q=Dak?i??vartan?tha&f=false <https://books.google.com/books?id=70uvBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT37&lpg=PT37&dq=Dak%E1%B9%A3i%E1%B9%87%C4%81vartan%C4%81tha&source=bl&ots=fJgek3fYnA&sig=IuQZUkdGSskYUIqSsIMN43p3VXU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiXnqHGtYPWAhWj6oMKHRveCIIQ6AEIRTAH#v=onepage&q=Dak%E1%B9%A3i%E1%B9%87%C4%81vartan%C4%81tha&f=false> ) If the name K?yakku?i is indeed mentioned in the commentary, and if Dak?i??vartan?tha?s place is still open, a possible candidate is Tiruppu?aimarut?r, the southern ?arjuna? location. (See https://www.google.com/maps/@9.8155248,77.8396093,8.27z <https://www.google.com/maps/@9.8155248,77.8396093,8.27z>)

One source dates Dak?i??vartan?tha to 12th century. See https://books.google.com/books?id=9P3lDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA118&lpg=PA118&dq=Dak?i??vartan?tha&source=bl&ots=6hFyoz8A9b&sig=XbHCimb93_96S5HpUkD63FXetXk&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjdqvSko4PWAhUB7oMKHf5OBUcQ6AEIRzAH#v=onepage&q=Dak?i??vartan?tha&f=false <https://books.google.com/books?id=9P3lDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA118&lpg=PA118&dq=Dak%E1%B9%A3i%E1%B9%87%C4%81vartan%C4%81tha&source=bl&ots=6hFyoz8A9b&sig=XbHCimb93_96S5HpUkD63FXetXk&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjdqvSko4PWAhUB7oMKHf5OBUcQ6AEIRzAH#v=onepage&q=Dak%E1%B9%A3i%E1%B9%87%C4%81vartan%C4%81tha&f=false>. In the 12th century, the P???iyas were in Madurai. Even if Dak?i??vartan?tha lived in the 14th or 15th century, there was no headquarters of the P???iyas on the K?yakku?i river. Two places associated with the P???iyas were Ukkira? K???ai (https://www.google.com/maps/@9.8155248,77.8396093,8.27z <https://www.google.com/maps/@9.8155248,77.8396093,8.27z>) and Te?k?ci (https://www.google.com/maps/@9.8155248,77.8396093,8.27z <https://www.google.com/maps/@9.8155248,77.8396093,8.27z>) Both are nowhere near the K?yakku?i river.

I think this K?yakku?i river is a red herring as far as identifying Uraga is concerned.

Once a pragrent lady has gone to other side to buy some items. On return, due to sudden rainfall there was a heavy water in the river and she has prayed to the Lord Venkatesa Perumal and he made the way for her. Due to this the people of this village has changed the name as "Achamthavilthan".

P. Unni).

> Why Dak?i??vartan?tha says that [the supposed Pandyan capital] N?gapuram is on the border of this river? Maybe because at the time of the late Pandyas (from the second third of the 14th c. onwards, after the establishment of the Sultanate of Madurai), their real capital was no longer in Madurai (even if they never stopped in their inscriptions to symbolically present themselves as the true rulers of Madurai); "they found themselves restricted to their more southern possessions" (K.A. Nilakanta Sastri, The Pandyan Kingdom, 1929, p. 217) in the regions of Srivilliputur, Tenkasi and Tirunelveli.

>> If the question is really about the river mentioned by a commentator, there is no river in Tamil Nadu called K?yaku??. If one considers the possibility that this name is a translation of some Tamil name, one has to allow for ?losses in translation?. According to Monier Williams, k?ya also means "assemblage , collection , multitude SaddhP.? This seems to be a synonym of sa?gha (perhaps referring to the legendary Tamil assembly in Madurai) or a translation of ?Ta. K??al?, another name of the city of Madurai.

But the Tamil word k?yal ('backwater, mouth of a stream") is far from the meaning of "Curve of the body" (ku?? is found in several words for/names of "curving" rivers). The T?mrapar??  herself is described by K?lid?sa in 4.50 (53  crit. ed. Goodall & Isaacson).

P. Unni (Highways and Byways in Sanskrit Literature, Delhi: New Bharatiya Book Corporation, 2012, p. 159, who relies on a KUML transcript-manuscript). It is in this case (like in other) the source of  Aru?agirin?tha (contemporary of  Mallin?tha, early 15th century - the latter who also sometimes uses Dak?i??vartan?tha has possibly misread his source here or, as you guess, his text has been later corrupted), himself followed by  N?r?ya?a Pa??ita.
