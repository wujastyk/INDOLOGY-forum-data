[INDOLOGY] A new Sanskrit Reader
Dear Dominik,
You (and Patrick) are absolutely right, and thoughts along the lines of
what you just said made up a considerable part of the proposal I submitted
to the publisher. (Below is some of what I said there.) Those thoughts are
of course going to limit which texts I can include in the Reader; but I am
hoping that annotating text passages in the same way I did in my textbook
means I will still be able to introduce a fair breadth of texts.
Again, thank you so much for taking the time to reply in such detail!
All the best,
    Antonia
