[INDOLOGY] New Book Announcement: Aurangzeb
Dear Colleagues,
I am please to announce the publication of *Aurangzeb: The Life and Legacy
of India's Most Controversial King, *Stanford University Press, 2017 (amazon
link <http://a.co/45i367a>).
It's a bit far from classical Indology, perhaps, although I do manage to
work in a few Sanskrit tidbits here and there.
The book has gotten me into a bit of trouble on social media, which you can
read about here
