Subject: [INDOLOGY] New Book Announcement: Aurangzeb
Message-ID: <CAKq175ptQkB3EVYLkgnEecGAiwPnbXj4vhNNnma5OL7C0TWo-Q@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Colleagues,

I am please to announce the publication of *Aurangzeb: The Life and Legacy
of India's Most Controversial King, *Stanford University Press, 2017 (amazon
link <http://a.co/45i367a>).

It's a bit far from classical Indology, perhaps, although I do manage to
work in a few Sanskrit tidbits here and there.

The book has gotten me into a bit of trouble on social media, which you can
read about here
