[INDOLOGY] Northern and southern Devanagari
Apologies for what is perhaps a very basic question:
I have always unreflectingly accepted the common distinction between 
northern ('Calcutta-style') and southern ('Bombay-style') Devanagari. 
Recently, though, I noticed that some manuscripts mix the two -- for 
instance, using a 'northern' /?a /but a 'southern' /a/, or even 
alternating between the two kinds of /?a /(in the same copyist's hand). 
Is there any special significance to this -- for example, particular 
regions and/or historical periods in which the two styles were less 
distinct? Or should it just be seen as a personal quirk of the scribe 
(perhaps an itinerant one)?
Thanks in advance for any light on this,
Martin Gansten
