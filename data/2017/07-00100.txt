[INDOLOGY] BHAMATI
 Dr.Tieken,
              I truly apologise  ,if my query being forwarded as an attachment has caused any 
agony for you.
                     All that I was asking for were the meaning of a few words which I came 
across while studying Bhamati, a book on Adwaitya Philosophy written by Bachaspati Misra in 
the  8th CE . I was surprised why it came in as an attachment because all that I did was 
forwarding and repeating  my query which I made a few day's back
                     Anyway I would be vigilant in future and avoid attachments so that our 
learning endeavours  does not get impeded  due to miscellaneous reasons.
                                                    ALAKENDU DAS.
