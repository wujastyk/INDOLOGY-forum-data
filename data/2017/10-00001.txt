[INDOLOGY] Fwd: Sanskrit-speaking village article
Dear Friends,
Please allow me to share with you a recent publication on a
"Sanskrit-speaking" village that has been published. I have also made some
short films about it this village called Jhiri, which is in MP. They are
available on YouTube "Imagining Sanskrit land".
