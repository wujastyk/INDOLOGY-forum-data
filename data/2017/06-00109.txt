[INDOLOGY] Sanskrit reader
Dear Antonia,
Can I suggest taking a look at AK Warder's often overlooked (and
unfortunately devanagari-devoid) "Sanskrit Prose Reader"? He includes
an excellent collection of texts and notes. The publisher - University
of Toronto - are unfortunately very unhelpful at providing copies but
resourceful researchers can find copies elsewhere. :)
Another useful reader which again lacks devanagari and whose
explanations are somewhat less than helpful is Gonda's Sanskrit Reader
- which focuses on the Epics & Puranas.
I have a feeling that both of these texts would have proved more
popular if they had been in devanagari but with the advances in OCR
and word processing - that should be easy to rectify.
Kind regards,
Antonio Ferreira-Jardim
