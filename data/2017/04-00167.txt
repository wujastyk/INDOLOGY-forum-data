Dear Jonathan Peterson,


The i?gud? (also i?guda) is also known as the *t?pasa-taru *
(Amarako?a)or *Muni-taru
*(S?ya?a), and beside its medicinal properties, it is associated with the
austere life ? either that of *??i*-s, or of people like R?ma who had to
spend a long time in the forest.


It is known for its lipid-rich fruit, that are crushed to extract an oil of
sorts; which is used as lamp fuel, and as an unguent for tying up hair into
the matted *ja??bh?ra* suitable for a forest-dweller,  as well as used as a
salve for wounds. The oilcake that remains after extracting the oil
*[i?gud?-pi?y?ka*] is favoured as an object for making ritual funereal
offerings.


All instances of the i?gud? in the R?m?ya?a are restricted to the
Ara?yak???a, which suggests that the tree is tied to the semiotics of the
forest and the forest-dwelling folk (the *t?pasa* and the *vaikh?nasa*, not
the hunter). When R?ma comes to the Ni??da king?s land - ???gaverapura, he
rests beneath a huge I?gud? tree. Later Bharata meets the Ni??da king, and
pays his respects to the tree where R?ma etc. spent a night.  The same
k???a also has a description of how R?ma, upon hearing news of Da?aratha?s
death offered the *niv?pa* water, and then a funeral pi??a of *i?gud?-pi?y?ka
*mixed with the jujube (*badaraphala*) in homage to his dead ancestor
[Ara?yak???a, 95th sarga?].


 The Abhij??na??kuntala refers to the oil-stained rocks used to crush
i?gud? (ostensibly for tying ja??) being markers of a hermitage in the
vicinity [First act, Du?yanta - *n?v?r?? etc?prasnigdh??
kvacidi?gud?phalabhida? s?cyanta evopal??*], to the use of i?gud? for
dressing wounds [fourth act - Ka?va to ?akuntal? describing her pet
deer ? *yasya
tvay? vra?a-viropa?am i?gud?n?? taila? nya?icyata mukhe ku?as?cividdhe* ].
The Raghuva??a refers to lamps lit with i?gud? oil (I?m unable to recollect
the full verse ? *t? i?gud?-sneha-k?ta-prad?p??* etc.)


That long prelude was only to point to the many features the *i?gud?*
shares, with the *zaytun*, as the nearest approximation, in terms of
bearing fruit that yield oil, as well as having religious/ritual
significance; and it was probably this overlap of features that prompted
the translator to use the i?gud?.



I join Prof Madhav Deshpande in requesting a pdf ? I would love to look at
this text.
