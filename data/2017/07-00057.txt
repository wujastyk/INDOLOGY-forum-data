As for the person tasked with removing the waste, I would be interested 
in knowing
the answer to that as well, but I do not have information on it. As I 
recall, the
vinaya sources I looked at simply said that the material "ought to be 
removed"
or something similar, but did not specify by whom. My understanding is 
that with
hygiene generally, it is often junior monks who help their superiors 
with things like
bathing. I would not be surprised if monastery servants also helped out with
tasks considered menial / defiling.
You might also wish to look at the travel record of the Chinese monk 
Yijing (I-Tsing),
whose work mentions a number of things about hygiene (see especially p. 91,
"On Evacuation").
There is a translation of that work by Takakusu Junjir? available on
