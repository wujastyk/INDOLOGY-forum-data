?One would never expect to pay a processing fee except if the article? is
being published OA.  And in that case, yes, Brill charges about ?2000 per
article for CC-BY.  See the pricing charts here
<http://www.brill.com/about/open-access/brill-open-authors>.
A related question is whether, having paid this fee, the author retains
copyright and issues the CC-BY license, or whether Brill takes the
copyright and the author's money, and they issue the CC-BY license.  The
latter is the case with this journal.
?I balk at asking permission to photocopy my own articles.  It's just not
right.  A more equitable situation is for the author to retain copyright
and issue to the publisher a license for them to do specifically what they
wish.  See some sample licenses and information here
<https://cikitsa.blogspot.co.at/2012/01/copyright-and-open-access.html>.
In the past, I have written to Brill saying "no" they can't have my
copyright, but that I'm willing to issue them a license.  And to my
surprise, they said yes immediately, and sent me a ready-printed license
agreement.  The terms weren't great, but at least they knew what I was
talking about and were prepared to let me keep copyright of my own work.
Sadly, because of the above issues, I personally do not find this new
journal offers authors a modern, fair deal.  It's obviously an exciting and
intellectually valuable initiative.  But it is a great pity the founding
editors did not press Brill harder to offer authors a more liberal deal
that respected their rights.
Best,
Dominik
