Dear colleagues,
I agree with Seishi Karashima that neither of these passages relate to Sanskrit pa?gu or pa?ku ?lame?, but the original edition indeed reads sayala-mahi | valaya-pauka in the pdf scan available at archive.org <http://archive.org/>. I did not see that Jacobi corrected this reading in the published edition,. but I also do not dispute that pa?klu is correct. I did not consult data input on the internet. Even the great scholars may have missed typographical errors!
Best wishes,
Elliot Stern
