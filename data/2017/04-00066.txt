Dear fellow Indologists,

For your interest, I'm delighted to circulate the programme for the upcoming Symposium on the History of Science in India which will take place next week 19--20 April, at the University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand.  Speakers and titles are pasted below and attached with their abstracts to this email.

We are thrilled that Dr Deepak Paramashivan, a internationally renowned Sarangi player, will be wrapping up the Symposium with an Indian classical music concert entitled "Sarangi: the sound of one hundred colours".

With best wishes,
