[INDOLOGY] Questioning South Asia Conference
Thank you Walter. I hope I?m not the only one that is somewhat incredulous at the idea that to accept the rubric of ?South Asia? as a legitimate organizing tool of scholarship ?signals acquiescence if not participation in an agenda informed by pursuit of global hegemony.?
?Pursuit of global hegemony?? 
I confess that I never imagined that I was unwittingly involved in a plot to rule the world.
