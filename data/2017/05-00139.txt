Thank you Walter. I hope I?m not the only one that is somewhat incredulous at the idea that to accept the rubric of ?South Asia? as a legitimate organizing tool of scholarship ?signals acquiescence if not participation in an agenda informed by pursuit of global hegemony.?

?Pursuit of global hegemony?? 

I confess that I never imagined that I was unwittingly involved in a plot to rule the world.

> "The geopolitical significance of South Asia has been a well-known fact in policy and security studies for the last several decades. In academic circles too, the logic of South Asia has become a naturalized reality: its appearance in the area studies departments of many US/western institutions signals acquiescence if not participation in an agenda informed by pursuit of global hegemony. The naturalisation of South Asia as a discourse recalls European precedents of producing knowledge about the ?other? in order to foster a morally and epistemologically superior European identity ? as witnessed in the historical invention of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. [...] Questioning South Asia as a discourse that at present burdens the scholarly imagination, and overdetermines conference agendas and research funding, might reconfigure the strategies we employ to understand the region. Some of the questions we seek to investigate are: What are the obstacles to developing comparative research perspectives for scholars constrained by ?South Asia?? How can we shift away from the dominant framework of South Asia as an already-determined category, and devise new research agendas? And what demands for change, transformation, or recalibration might this place on us as subjects undertaking research?"
