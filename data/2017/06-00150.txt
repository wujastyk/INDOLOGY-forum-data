[INDOLOGY] More Devanagari font samples
Dear Dominik,
     When I tried to install the Yashomudra fonts on my MacBook using Font
Book, it came back with a serious sounding warning: "These fonts have 10
errors.  Do not use these fonts."  Have you or anyone else had a similar
experience with these fonts?
