Classical Tamil poems mention an act of cruelty by Na??a?,  a king, whose royal tree was a mango tree. One day a mango from the tree fell into a river and floated down the river. A girl bathing in the river picked it up and ate it. The king had her killed. Thereafter, he attained notoriety as Na??a?, who killed a girl. There is a poem in the Ku?untokai, which alludes to this event.

Here is the poem in A. K. Ramanujan?s translation.

What Her Girl-Friend Said

When a lovely girl bathing in a river
ate a gree mango from his tree
floated by the water,
for that crime
King Na??a? would take nothing,
not even an offer of nine times nine bull elephants
and the girl?s weight in gold
moulded as a doll,

but just killed her.

                                 Like him,
may this mother, too, go to everlasting hell!

For, the other day, when our girl?s lover
    just came in
as a guest with a smiling face,
this woman wouldn?t sleep for days

as if she were a city on an enemy line.

One of the first things I'm setting out to do is learn as much as possible about mangoes in Indian history or philosophy or travelogue,  or any texts. I wished to explore mangoes as metaphor, as ingredient, as mudra or prose.
