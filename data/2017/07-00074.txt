Dear Michael,
     If you have a pdf of your article on Y?j?avalkya, please send it to me
and to other interested scholars.
     I probably have a copy of the volume, but it is now sitting in some
box.  Our Ann Arbor home just went under a sales contract, and we are
hoping that we would successfully migrate to California by mid-September.
     Best,
Madhav
