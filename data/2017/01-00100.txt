[INDOLOGY] two new issues of  Electronic Journal of Vedic Studies
Dear All,
we are happy to announce that, at the end of 2016, two new issues of the Electronic Journal of Vedic Studies have been uploaded at our new main location, Cross-Asia Journals at Heidelberg.
Vol. 23, 2 is an extensive  paper by Doris Srinivasan, dealing with the vexed question of the Ku???a time deity Oe?o and his relation with ?iva.

"This paper brings together studies published over the last fifteen years which clarify aspects of the so-called Oe?o/?iva problem. Essentially, the problem revolves around the identification of the figure on Ku???a coins and seals which has some '?iva' markers but is inscribed 'Oe?o'. The prevailing opinion that the figure is ?iva cannot be maintained in light of the information from the recent findings, discussed below?"
Vol. 23,3 by Marcos Albino deals with a difficult passage in the Maitr?ya?i Sa?hit?.
