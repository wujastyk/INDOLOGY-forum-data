Subject: [INDOLOGY] Cambridge University Press yields to PRC censorship
Message-ID: <CAKdt-CfOFj112Hce3z0Yec+y694Y5xLucHCEU9hbcVACWEkXxQ@mail.gmail.com>

In a truly shocking development, and to the everlasting shame of Cambridge
University Press, the CUP journal *China Quarterly* has removed 300
articles and reviews relating to Tibet and other topics, that the present
Chinese communist government finds ideologically troublesome.

Shame on CUP.
