[INDOLOGY] Cambridge University Press yields to PRC censorship
In a truly shocking development, and to the everlasting shame of Cambridge
University Press, the CUP journal *China Quarterly* has removed 300
articles and reviews relating to Tibet and other topics, that the present
Chinese communist government finds ideologically troublesome.
Shame on CUP.
