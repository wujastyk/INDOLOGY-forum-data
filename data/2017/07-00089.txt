[INDOLOGY] Fw:  BHAMATI
Dear all ? and especially the moderators of the list,
I am in general hesitant to open attachments, especially when its content has not been clearly specified ? as is the case in Akalendu's message, and there have been more. All we get here is "Bhamati". I am curious to know if the Indology List has a policy in this matter? Or am I the only one who makes a point of it?
Best, Herman
