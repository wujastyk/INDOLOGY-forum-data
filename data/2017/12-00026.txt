=?utf-8?Q?Re:_[INDOLOGY]_pdf_of_the_Varadar=C4=81jastava?=
Thank you very much for this link which I could not - for whatever reason - locate myself!!!
I wonder, furthermore, if anyone on this list may have a pdf of the (?r?mad)Appayyad?k?itendravijaya, a text I encountered referenced in some secondary literature (Bronner 2014, in particular).
thanks a lot, 
best, 
Andrey
