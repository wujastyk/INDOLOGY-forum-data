[INDOLOGY] Transliteration font for vedic sanskrit with accents
Dear list members,
I'm looking for a transliteration font to type sections of the taittiriya
samhita with accents so it needs to have svarita accent (vertical line
above ), double svarita (two vertical lines above) and anudatta (horizontal
line underneath).
Underline for the anudatta accent doesn't work too well because it obscures
diacriticals underneath the letter.
I'm aware of the URW ITU font from Omkarananda ashram that comes with
ITranslator 2003.  www.omkrananda-asrham.org .  But do any of the list
members know of any other fonts I could use.
Thanks,
Harry Spier
