=?utf-8?Q?[INDOLOGY]_Help_with_identification_of_an_apparent_grammatical_s=C5=ABtra?=
Dear colleagues,
In his commentary on the second verse of the *Dev?m?h?tmya, *?antanu gives
a string of glosses of the word *m?y?*. The first gloss he gives is: *m?ty
asy?? vi?va? m?y?/ m?k?bhy?m ayac/  *The first part of this is quite
straightforward, but I can't make heads or tails of the second part. It has
the appearance of a s?tra providing for an affix *ayaC *after *m? *and *k? *
(*kai*?), but it's not from the *A???dhy?y?, Mah?bh??ya, *or the
*U??dis?tras*. And *U??dis?tra *4.109 (*m?ch?sasis?bhyo ya?*) is normally
cited to derive *m?y?. *If anyone has any insight on what this might be,
please let me know.
If you want to see the larger context, this is a link for a PDF of a
beautiful 1903 edition by Ga?g?vi??u ?r?k???ad?sa that our library at Brown
digitized, in which this comment appears on 2r: (The file is 169 MB)
