[INDOLOGY] MR Kale biodata
Thanks Mrinal.and Klaus, It is nice to know I have not been suffering alone
in my curiosity. MR Kale effectively changed my life. I have to get to know
about him. Perhaps if we hit a dead-end, I'll one day go to the U of Bombay
Skt department and ask some of the senior faculty about him. Best,J
