[INDOLOGY] Attantya Abhava
 Dr.Williams,
                    Thank you for your explanation. I,too, am aware of the fact that colour of 
Wind is a befitting example of Attyanta Abhava. 
                                                  However, in course of my Vedanta Philosophy 
studies ,I got stuck over a particular issue. Does the statement' The pot does not exist in this 
plane'(BHUTALE GHATA NASTI") can be taken as an example of AttantyaAbvhava? I am a bit sceptical  
on this issue. AttantyaAbhava means something which has a constant multidimensional absence ( 
Trikaala Badhita). The absence of Pot in This plane may not necessarily mean it's absence in 
other planes too. 
                      In spite of this, can it be taken as an example of AttyantaAbhava.?
                                                          ALAKENDU DAS
