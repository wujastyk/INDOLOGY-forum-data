Subject: [INDOLOGY] My retirement
Message-ID: <CAB3-dzdoVQ2vMVnyug7=XrWL+gb=RPjZub8FVZJV19JKT56jDw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Colleagues,

     Just to keep you informed, I am retiring from the University of
Michigan by the end of this month, after teaching for 45 years.  My wife,
Shubhangi, and I will migrate to California, in the next few months, to be
closer to our daughters and their families.  For the time being, I will
keep the same email address, but the physical mailing address will change
once we actually migrate to California.

Madhav Deshpande
Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA
