[INDOLOGY] My retirement
Dear Colleagues,
     Just to keep you informed, I am retiring from the University of
Michigan by the end of this month, after teaching for 45 years.  My wife,
Shubhangi, and I will migrate to California, in the next few months, to be
closer to our daughters and their families.  For the time being, I will
keep the same email address, but the physical mailing address will change
once we actually migrate to California.
