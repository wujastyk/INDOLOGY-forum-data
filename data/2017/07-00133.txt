Dear List Members,

 

The following is an announcement of an international conference hosted by the Section for East Asian Art History at the University of Zurich.

 

Conference of the European Association for Asian Art and Archaeology

 

To be held at the University of Zurich

August 24-27, 2017

 

The University of Zurich is the only institution of higher learning in Switzerland where the subject of East Asian art history can be studied as a full program.  The broader aim of the department is to promote the discipline of East Asian art history, not only in Switzerland, but also on an international stage. For this reason, we are proud to host this major conference, that will bring together over two hundred speakers from across the world.

 

The purposes of the conference are multifold.  We hope to open dialogues between scholars of Asian art and archaeology and to offer a platform for the presentation and discussion of recent research and for highlighting the significance of Asian art and archaeology collections in European collections and institutions. Our goals include the revision of historical approaches that have been prevalent in the study and research of Asian art and archaeology, the elaboration of existing art theories and methodology, and the formation of new research approaches and methods in Asian art and archaeology. 


 

The conference is co-organized by the European Association for Asian Art and Archaeology (President Prof. Dr. Nata?a Vampelj Suhadolnik and Vice-President Dr.  Patricia Frick) and the University of Zurich (Prof. Dr. Hans Bjarne Thomsen, Anna Hagdorn, Natasha Fischer-Vaidya, Sabine Bradel, Alina Martimyanova and the graduate and undergraduate students from the Section for East Asian Art History at the University of Zurich).
