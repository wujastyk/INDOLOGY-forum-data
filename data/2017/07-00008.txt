=?utf-8?Q?[INDOLOGY]_prakrit_ka=E1=B8=8Da-patta?=
Dear listmembers,
I am searching for the meaning of sinhalese /k??apat/,
which means something like a message for a king.
Paranavitana explains this word as sk /k???ha-patra/, a message written 
on wood.
This was in use in Central-Asia but not in Sri Lanka.
I suggest a Prakrit-word, since I remember pk ka?a = bamboo etc.
Anyone came across a similar word in Prakrit describing a message?
And messages written on bamboo?
Best
Heiner
