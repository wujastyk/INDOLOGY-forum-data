[INDOLOGY] two papers on Mohenjo Daro - a request
Dear Colleagues,
I've been trying to get a copy of any of two papers, but with no success.
Does anyone have an access to the two following publications:
Saletore, Bhaskar Anand (1939) "*Identification of a Mohenjo Daro
Figure*", *The
New Review* [Calcutta] 10 (1939) 28-35.
Parpola, Asko (1989) "*The 'fig deity seal' from Mohenjo-Daro: Its
iconography and inscription,*" pp. 227-236 in: Catherine Jarrige (ed.), *South
Asian Archaeology* 1989. (Monographs in World Archaeology, 14.) Madison,
Wisconsin: Prehistory Press.
I would greatly appreciate PDFs.
Best regards,
Piotr Balcerowicz
