[INDOLOGY] BACHASPATI MISRA'S BHAMATI
 To All,
         I qoute from the Introductory preface from  Bachaspati Misra's BHAMATI'  where he 
writes,while pledging his respect for Badarayana -
                              ' Brahmasutra Krte Tasmai Bedbyasyaya Bedase
                                 GyanshaktaAvataraya namo BHAGAVATE HARE'
   My question remains- Was  Bachaspati Misra was a Vaishnava.?
                                                               ALAKENDU  DAS.
