I hesitate to pass this popular-science treatment of the question along, since it is tinged with
some personal animosity, but this just appeared two days ago:

    In my book "The Roots of Hinduism: The Early Aryans and the Indus Civilization",

    I present manifold evidence for the Dravidian affinity of the Harappan language.

    There is no consensus about which language or languages the
    Harappan (Indus Valley Civilization) people spoke.
    The script is considered by most to be logo-syllabic, not
    heiroglyphic.
    Farmer, Witzel, Sproat consider it to be a sign system rather than a
    script associated with any particular language.

    To All, While going through some books on Indus valley civilisation
    , I failed to find out one answer. Though the Harappana & Mohenjo
    daro script has been inferred as more of a Hieroglyphic type, what
    dialect/language did they speak ? Would love to be enlightened on
    this point. ALAKEND DAS.
