Dear Madhav and Christophe,
Undoubtably Hopkins consulted his colleague Karen Lang about the verse and reports her response
to his query. He is not referring to her published work. I have no idea why he is speaking of
"Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit" here at all. The Tibetan author, Dge-'dun-chos-'phel, spent considerable
time in India and was a fair Sanskritist. But Tibetan publications of his writings often introduce
errors into his Sanskrit citations. This hardly qualifies them as BHS.
