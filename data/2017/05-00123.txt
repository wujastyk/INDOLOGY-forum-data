[INDOLOGY] "Puspika"
Thank you, Nagaraj, Timothy, and P?ter-D?niel. The floral aspect certainly
is curious, and does indeed bring to mind a final 'blossoming', and the
decorative fleurons found at the end of some manuscripts.
The reference Bhattacharya's article eventually led me to Radhakanta Deva's
*?abdakalpadruma*, which is the earliest lexicographical entry for the term
I have so far been able to find. So this usage is at least datable to the
late eighteenth/early nineteenth century.
The search continues...
Best and thanks,
Tyler
