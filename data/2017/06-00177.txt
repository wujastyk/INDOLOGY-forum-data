[INDOLOGY] Ismail Jogi mantra
I would like to express my gratitude to the participants in this discussion
for their valuable inputs.
My thanks go to Nagaraj Paturi, Tyler Williams and Danuta Stasik (off list).
Dear Daniela -
are you already at Kamakhya Devi? Would you please ask the priests there
about the legacy of Ismail Jogi?
