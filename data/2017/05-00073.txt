[INDOLOGY] Buddhasrijnana's Abhisamaya commentary
Dear Birgit,
Thank you for the link! Time to resurrect my feeble and fading Hindi (I
hope my teacher M?ria N?gyesi is not on this list, heaven knows she tried!).
I am also interested to find out about R?hulj?'s last years, especially
those leading up to his 1957 book on the doh?s. Was he already suffering
from memory losses at this point?
Yours,
Peter
