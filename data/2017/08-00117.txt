[INDOLOGY] Gita 13.6
Dear Alakendu Das-ji,
Yes, involution and evolution are two English translation attempts found at
many places in this case.
As with all the intercultural translations, these two too have some
problems.
But for those who already know the original source language
expressions/ideas, they communicate correctly.
They may create problems while addressing the target language readers who
are new to the source language ideas.
