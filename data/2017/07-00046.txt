[INDOLOGY] New journal: "South Asian Intellectual History"
Dear Andrew,
When I hear about a new journal, these are the questions that I ask
immediately:
   1. Who is the editor and editorial board?  (very distinguished; bravo)
   2. Will articles be Open Access?
   3. Is there an Article Processing Fee, and if so how much?
   4. Who will own the copyright of the articles in the journal?  Will
   authors have to sign their rights over to Brill?
I cannot find the answers to 2-4 on the Brill website.  Can you help?
Best,
Dominik
