[INDOLOGY] Indian criticisms of astrology?
Thank you for the clarifications, Walter.
The opinion of the author of the MU seems to differ only by degree from 
the general consensus of Indian astrologers, then: he claims that /all 
/effects of past action may be counteracted by present action; they say 
that /some /effects (/ad??ha-karman/) may be so counteracted, while 
others (/d??ha-karman/) are too powerful and therefore must take effect. 
Both operate within a framework of karma theory.
In the case of a person who is not willing to make any great effort to 
change his 'fate', then, I suppose our author would agree that the 
person's actions from previous lives will largely determine his present 
one. The question that I am really after is this: would he then accept 
the celestial mechanics studied and interpreted by astrologers as 
accurately reflecting such /karma-phala/? But perhaps that is not a 
topic that comes up in the MU.
Best wishes,
Martin
