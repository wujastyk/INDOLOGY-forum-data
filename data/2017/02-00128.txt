Dear Gary,
In the Jaina canon there are various passages in which pa??ita-mara?a is contrasted with b?la-mara?a; see Schubring, Die Lehre der Jainas, p. 182. I am certain that in among other Buddhist texts the Suttanip?ta, similar passages with the b?la-pa??ita pair may be found.

A colleague has asked about the history of the term ?pa??ita? and in particular whether it is found used early on to refer to a persons who is clever or wise without necessarily being a learned person in a formal way.
