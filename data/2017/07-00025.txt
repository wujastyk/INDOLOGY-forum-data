[INDOLOGY] Sanskrit Readers: compiled list
Dear Antonia,
Thank you for this most useful list.  Since you include specialized 
collections of texts in translation, it would be good to add Patrick 
Olivelle's recent and excellent /A Dharma Reader: Classical Indian Law 
/(Columbia UP, 1917).
Thanks again,
Rosane *
