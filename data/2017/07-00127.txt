BTW, the longer one is probably the srog-shing, the vital core (lit. life-tree),
serving as the central channel of the consecrated object.

Subject: [INDOLOGY] question about some objects

Dear colleagues,

I just came into possession of 11 cylindrical objects, 1 about 9 cm long
and 1.5 cm in diameter, the other 10 about 5 cm long and 1.25 cm in
diameter. I do not know what they are. Perhaps, someone knowlegeable
can suggest to me how I can find out what they are.

The person who gave these items to me reports that they were
discovered when a statue of the Buddha broke. The statue was part of a
collection held somewhere in the state of Michigan.

Cordially yours,
Brendan Gillon
