Yes, it is just mis-segmentation, no doubt. Again, you sometimes see the same thing in published inscriptions, e.g., *chandogasa-brahmac?rin for chandoga-sabrahmac?rin.

Subject: Re: [INDOLOGY] {???????????????????} a question regarding the usage of -gotra versus -sagotra

I was surprised to see that in the lists of gotras circulated on the web, in many cases, the "sa" of "X-sagotra" has been attached to the name of the gotra itself, i.e. "Xsa".  One can see several examples in the list below:

http://familypedia.wikia.com/wiki/Brahmin_gotra_system

This list includes "?treyasa", for instance, as a gotra-name.  The only way I can think how this came about is a misanalysis of "?treya-sagotra" as "?treyasa-gotra."  I have not checked the names listed in texts like the Gotra-pravara-ma?jar? to see if this phenomenon has affected the lists in Sanskrit texts as well.

Dear colleagues,

     I am forwarding a question from a friend of mine, for which I do not have a clear answer:

Dear Madhav,

I thought you might have a quick answer to this question. When mentioning gotras, one sees "Visv?mitra gotra", but also "?treyasa gotra", and "K?syapasa gotra".

Since the ??is in the two latter cases are Atri and Kasyapa, it would appear that the corresponding gotras should be "?treya" and "K?syapa", without the "sa" suffix. (Indeed, one also sees "?treya gotra", and "K?syapa gotra".)

Is it the case that the correct terms are "?treya sagotra", and "K?syapa sagotra", and the conventional usage is simply an incorrect parsing? However, this would require "Visv?mitra sagotra", which one does not see.

Or is there something more to it than that?

Unquote

Why would someone be referred to as Vi?v?mitra-gotra, but others as ?treya-sagotra or K??yapa-sagotra?  I will appreciate a clarification.
