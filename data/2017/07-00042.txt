Dear Dr. Mak,
They are not hypermetrical. A mixture of Tri??ubh and Jagat? metres in one
stanza is found in verses of the old stratum of the Mah?bh?rata, in the
older Pali scriptures, e.g. the Suttanip?ta, Dhammapada, Therag?th? etc.,
in the Mah?vastu, and in the older so-called "Mah?y?na" scriptures, such as
the Saddharmapu??ar?ka, Sam?dhir?as?tra etc. See my article: "The
Tri??ubh-Jagat? Verses in the Saddharmapu??ar?ka" (https://www.academia.edu/

With best regards,
Seishi Karashima
