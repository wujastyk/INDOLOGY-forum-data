[INDOLOGY] Query
Correction:
E. A. Wallis Budge, Baralam and Yewasef
Budge has a lengthy introduction dealing with the question of the Indian sources,
in which he favors, not the Buddhacarita, but the Lalitavistaras?tra, a very widely
diffused scripture during the early centuries BCE
hope this helps
