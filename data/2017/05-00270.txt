[INDOLOGY] Request for assistance
Dear Indology List,
I hope that there may be someone with access to pdf-s of the two volume ?va?yaka-c?r?i of Jinad?sa, published in 1928-29 who might share them. This is not the 14th century ?va?yaka-niryukty-avac?r?i available on the Jain eLibrary site. If the C?r?i is available on some server that has eluded my detection, please provide me guidance.
The complete reference:
Jinada?sa-gan?imahattara-kr?taya? su?tra-cu?rn?ya? sametam? s?ri?mad-A?vas?yakasu?tram, 2 vols., ed. R?s?abha-devaji Kes?ari?malaji? S?veta?mbara Sam?stha? (Ratlam & Indore, 1928-29)
Any assistance will be greatly appreciated.
Sincerely,
Ron Davidson
