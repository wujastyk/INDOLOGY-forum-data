[INDOLOGY] Sarvadarshan Samgraha
Daer Alakendu,
You may wish also to consult
Klaus K. Klostermaier,
Sarvadar?anasa?graha ascribed to M?dhav?c?rya, Chapter 16: ?a?karadar?anam
 (Chennai: The Adyar Library, 1999)
for the translation of the last chapter, which was not included in Cowell & Gough.
Also, in a very important article,
Anantalal Thakur, ?Cannibha??a and the authorship of the
Sarvadar?anasa?graha,?
 Bulletin of the Adyar Library
 25(1961): 524?538
it is very convincingly shown that M?dhava was not in fact the author of the SDS.
Thakur's remarkable detective work has unfortunately been overlooked by
most scholars for a half century!
I have discussed some questions raised by the SDS here:
