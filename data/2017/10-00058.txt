[INDOLOGY] Mango miracle (Re:  Fwd: Request for subscription
First thing which comes to my mind is the well-known story of the "Mango 
miracle" which the 12th cent. Periya Pur??am attributes to K?raikk?l 
Ammaiy?r (one of the 63 Tamil Shaiva saints, who may have lived in the 
6th century.
See the pointer to a popular modern retelling of the story (as a movie)
