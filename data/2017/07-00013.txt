On behalf of the family and the Ancient India & Iran Trust, I am writing with the sad news that our founding Trustee Dr Bridget Allchin passed away on 27th June at Broadland View Care Home in Norwich peacefully after a short illness aged 90.
The funeral will be at the West Chapel in Cambridge Crematorium at 1.30 pm on Thursday 20th July 2017 followed by a reception at Wolfson College, Cambridge at 3 pm. Her family have asked that no flowers should be sent, but donations for Alzheimer?s Research can be made c/o Gordon Barber Funeral Director, 2 St Williams Way, Norwich NR7 0AW.
It would be very helpful to the family to know if you are planning to come to the funeral and reception, for catering purposes. If possible, please email the Trust Administrator: info at indiran.org<mailto:info at indiran.org>
Bridget?s family have announced that they are also hoping to hold a memorial service for Bridget in the autumn as a celebration of her life.
There will be a full appreciation of Bridget?s life and contribution to the AIIT, but meanwhile read Danika Parikh?s piece written in celebration of Bridget?s 90th birthday last February http://www.indiran.org/bridget-allchin-pioneering-prehistorian-of-south-asian-archaeology/
