[INDOLOGY] New journal: "South Asian Intellectual History"
Dear friends and colleagues,
Given this discussion, it's an apt moment to remind everybody -- Read your
publishing contracts and consider negotiating/altering them before signing.
I have successfully altered numerous contracts related to the publication
of articles. For me, I'm typically seeking the ability to share the final,
published version of the article. I don't always get my way, but often I do.
