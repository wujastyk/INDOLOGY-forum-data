[INDOLOGY] Discussing Academia.edu
I agree, Joe.  While university sites are quite nice, and so are some
publishers' sites, they're all ghettos in the end.  The catholicity of
Academia.edu, with people from anywhere, senior or junior, and not tied to
any institution or publisher, means that there's a real culture of
interaction.  There are some problems one can imagine arising from that
openness too, of course, but so far it's been a pretty good environment.
Best,
Dominik
