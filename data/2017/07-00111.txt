[INDOLOGY] Sanskrit Readers: compiled list
Dear all,
I just noticed that the translation of Stenzler into English by Renate Soehnen-Thieme is nowhere mentioned.
Of course it is not a good textbook for modern students, but it still is an excellent, and mercifully short
reference grammar. Everything is there with a minimum of words. All my students always found it very useful
starting the 2nd year Sanskrit.
Best wishes
