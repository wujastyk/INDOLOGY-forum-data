Hello Victor,
     I have not seen ??kh?vr?k?a as an example in a Sanskrit grammatical
work or in Sanskrit literature.  However, I see this word used in Marathi
and Hindi texts dealing with genealogical trees and describing the ??kh?s
of the Veda.  The explanation by the commentator on Meghad?ta seems
appropriate: ?i?j?vanti valay?ni as a parallel to ??kh?v?n vr?k?a?.
