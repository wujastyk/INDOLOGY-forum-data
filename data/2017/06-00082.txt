[INDOLOGY] A new Sanskrit Reader
Let us remember that Lanman was a reader to help first and second year students enter the world of Sanskrit. Making the new text an anthology of all Sanskrit texts will defeat its purpose. I think it is better to give samples of different ?genre? of Sanskrit literature rather than texts from different ?fields? of literature. Finally, Dr. Ruppel will have to exercise judgement about what will be useful from a student?s perspective.
