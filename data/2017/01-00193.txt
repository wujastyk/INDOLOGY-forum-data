Dear all,

I really should check my Indology mails more often.

Dominik, thank you for asking about my textbook. It has indeed not come out
yet due to problems with the publisher, who went through 'a process of
internal restructuring' that began soon after I submitted the typescript in
May 2015. And yes, it is currently meant to be published in March.

I will make pdfs of the first few chapters available on the book website (
www.cambridge-sanskrit.org) as soon as the proofs have been finalised
(hopefully this coming week or the week after). If anyone has any questions
whatsoever, please do email me.

Inspection copies can be ordered here: http://www.cambridge.
org/gb/academic/subjects/religion/buddhism-and-eastern-religions/cambridge-
introduction-sanskrit?format=PB

All the best,
    Antonia
