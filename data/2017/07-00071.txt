Yes, this seems to be the most probable explanation, see e.g. Gonda's Vedic Literature (p. 327):
This corpus is called "White" or "Clear" (?ukla) because it consists entirely of a conveniently arranged collection of mantras to be recited at sacrifices, and is free from the explanatory matter that is collected in separate br?ma?as.
Gonda refers to Eggeling's ?PB I, p. xxvii and to  C. L. Prabhakar's article in Bh?rat?ya Vidy? 28 (1968): 64.
If I remember well, Frits Staal says more or less the same in his Discovery of Veda.
