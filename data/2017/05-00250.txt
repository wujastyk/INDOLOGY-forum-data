[INDOLOGY] The pre-natal/pre-incarnatory curse in Indian literature
Regarding curses preceding incarnation, the following passage from 
Balabhadra's /H?yanaratna/ (1649, /pace/ Pingree, who says 1629) seems 
to fit the bill:
* * * * *
hill?jena tu brahmavi??urudramukhanirgata??pena yavanat?? pr?ptena 
?r?s?rye?aiva yavana??strapra?ayan?d dvij?n?m api s?ryasiddh?ntavad 
etadadhyayana? yuktam ity uktam |

    romake?a puri labdham a?e?a? tad dvij?dibhir ato ?dhyayan?yam || iti |
puri romakapattane |
But Hill?ja says [in /Hill?jad?pik? /1.6] that because the Yavana 
science was founded by the illustrious  sun [god] himself, who had 
become a Yavana due to a curse issued from the mouths of Brahm?, Vi??u 
and Rudra, the study of this is proper even for the twice-born, like 
[the study of] the /S?ryasiddh?nta/:
    Romaka received this whole [science] in the city from the sun [god],
    who, by a curse issued from the mouths of Brahm?, ?iva and Vi??u,
    had attained the state of a foreigner (/mleccha/); therefore, it is
    fit to be studied by the twice-born and others.
?In the city? [means] in the city of Rome.

For teachings at night, what about the P??car?tra?
