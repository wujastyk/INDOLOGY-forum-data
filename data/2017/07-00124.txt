Subject: [INDOLOGY] Digitization of Rare books at the BORI
Message-ID: <CAB3-dzcNRDAgvr4_GhK=BbN6880=Mm1OdULzzZjSeF5x3AEokw@mail.gmail.com>

Here is an exciting news report about digitization of rare books at the
BORI:

I hope the digitization projects succeed and the digitized books become
openly available to scholars worldwide.

Congratulations to Shrikant Bahulkar and his team at the BORI.
