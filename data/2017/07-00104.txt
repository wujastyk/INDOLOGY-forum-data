Dear All,
I find meaningful to forward you a message from Prof. K.D. Tripathi, who met Andr? Padoux twice in Paris, when he visited there at my invitation. Both men had equal esteem and friendship for each other.
Here is Prof. Tripathi's message, a beautiful homage, indeed:
To,
Prof. Lyne Bansat ?Boudon,
 Peris
Dear Prof. Lyne Bansat ?Boudon,
Your email of 17th July 2017 to hand. It is a sad news indeed that Andr? Padoux, a renowned  scholar and an authority on Kashmir Shaiva   philosophy, has passed away on 16th July.
We, the Scholars of Varanasi, mourn his sad demise. Please convey our sincere condolences to his family and oblige.
With profound regards
Yours
K.D. Tripathi
