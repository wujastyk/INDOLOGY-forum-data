Dear colleagues,
thanks to my discussion with Federico Squarcini last year, I have learned that papers on the Yogas?tras written by a Czech scholar Adolf Jan??ek and published in the fifties in Archiv Orient?ln? may still be inspirational for scholars interested in the P?ta?jalayoga??stra. Since these articles are not easily available (all volumes of the journal are in the Digital Library of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, but it's a bit cumbersome to get any particular article from this depository), I have uploaded them on archive.org.
