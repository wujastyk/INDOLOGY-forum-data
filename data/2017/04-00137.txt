[INDOLOGY] Female name Bhaayi?
I am sure, most of you must be aware of the female name ending b?? /b?y?/
b?y /b? found in many contemporary northern particularly north-western
languages.
Pingree's version is possibly b?? >v??, such a phonetic change b<>v being
quite common many Indian languages.
The bh?? version could possibly be a hyperstandardization or scribal error.
