made interesting observations.
Prof. Velcheru Narayana Rao in his PhD dissertation written in Telugu uses
the word dvikartrikatva to refer to the the authorship of the dictating
composer anticipating the role of an explaining / elaborating
lecture-performer such as a pauraaNika and the 'authorship' of the
explaining / elaborating lecture-performer such as a pauraaNika.
I propsed in my conference paper

that
gadyapadyamis'ra format of champ? is a result of bringing the lyric -prose

There could be more regional Indian (language) writings.
