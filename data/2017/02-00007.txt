[INDOLOGY] Yoga and Sexual Violence Conference/Workshop: Save the Date
Dear Friends,
Thanks to funds made available through SARI <http://sari.anu.edu.au/>,
we are beginning to organise a small conference/workshop on 'Yoga and
Sexual Violence'. This builds on the conference we organised last year
about 'Yoga and the Body'
<http://sari.anu.edu.au/yoga-and-the-body-past-and-present/>.
The tentative timing for the conference is scheduled for the *second half
of 2017*. The most likely date is *sometime in November*, which is a lovely
time to be in Canberra, Australia.
A confirmed date, more information, and an official call for papers will
occur in the next few months. For now, we invite you to *save the date. *We
will consider all possibilities that explore the theme, which includes
perspectives that are grounded in philology, history, anthropology, and
beyond.
All the best,
Patrick McCartney, PhD
