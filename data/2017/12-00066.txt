[INDOLOGY] Kshut(a)
Thanks to those who replied already, on and off the list. I can see I 
should have been clearer: I was primarily interested in knowing whether 
????? /k?uta /really exists in the sense 'awkward' (or similar) in Hindi 
or other NIA languages. Thanks to Dick Plukker for answering this in the 
negative (still a result).
Several people have pointed out that sneezing is commonly seen as an 
omen. Even if it were always a bad omen, though, this sense wouldn't 
quite work here: in the T?jika texts where I have found the word, k?ut 
or k?uta (both forms occur) is used as a technical term in the specific 
context of planetary aspects (k?udd???i, k?utad???i). A not infrequent 
Sanskrit synonym is kr?rad???i. It did occur to me to wonder whether 
k?ut(a) might be of Persian derivation (it doesn't seem to be related to 
any Arabic term that I have found), but wondering is as far as I've got. 
Early sources gloss it in a way that might suggest that it would seem 
foreign to Indian readers (/tisro ?rid??a? k?ut?khy?? syu?/, etc).
Lubom?r Ondra?ka helpfully suggested a look at the V?caspatyam. The 
entry 
<http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/VCPScan/2013/web/webtc/servepdf.php?page=2381> 
there deals mostly with sneezing as an omen but does go on to mention 
the T?jika meaning briefly:
(The reference is to the T?jikan?laka??h?.) This is the sense I'm after, 
but of course the V?caspatyam doesn't discuss etymology. If the sense is 
restricted to T?jika texts, though, that increases the likelihood of a 
comparatively recent foreign origin.
Any further leads on this would be greatly appreciated!
