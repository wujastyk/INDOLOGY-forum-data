I would like to thank Christophe Veille, Kei Kataoka, Kiyotaka Yoshimizu, and Andrew Ollett for their prompt and generous responses to this request. I now have more than one copy of MUSS 24, the damaged volume as well as a copy of the two damaged pages.

I?m hoping a list member can provide a scan of these pages (or a scan of the entire volume).
