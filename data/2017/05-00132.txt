[INDOLOGY] Devanagari - QWERTY for Mac
Dear Colleagues,
     I found a way of extracting the Devanagari - QWERTY.keylayout from
Apple's .bundle, and have been able to modify it with Ukelele to add
several characters that are missing in it.  Now I am able to enter: ?, ?, ?
, ?? and ?? with these modifications.  I have tried the Unicode signs for
Svarita and Anud?tta markings.  However, the Anud?tta marking overprints
the signs like ?, ? and ?, and I have not yet found a solution of how to
get the Anud?tta sign below these.  Any suggestions?
     Will keep on looking for solutions for these.
