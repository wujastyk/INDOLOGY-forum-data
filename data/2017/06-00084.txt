[INDOLOGY] A new Sanskrit Reader
Dear all,
Thank you so much for taking the time to send such thoughtful replies, both
on- and off-list.
All suggestions you have made will be very useful. I am hoping to have an
online component (i.e. texts annotated in the same way as those in the
printed part, but made available for free as supplementary pdfs), which
should make it possible to have room even for less standard texts.
It has been said by many of you, but: this list is a kalpataru indeed.
All the very best from London,
     Antonia
