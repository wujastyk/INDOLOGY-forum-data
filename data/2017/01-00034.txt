If you look at ????????, ????????????, ?????????? and  ???????????? , the
other three relative , prior (pre-effect /pre-birth) absence, later
(post-destruction) absence, mutual  absence (absence of one in relation
(such as location) to the other). Hence ?????????? should be absolute
absence. r?pa? is form not colour.
