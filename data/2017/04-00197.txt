  Dear Colleagues,


I would like to announce the publication of 'R?ja Yudhi??hira, Kingship in Epic Mah?bh?rata'.


This is published simultaneously here in America by Cornell UP and by Orient Black Swan in Delhi.


The book is similar in concepts and methods to my other MBh. works:


The Sanskrit Hero, Kar?a in Epic Mah?bh?rata (Brill, 2004); Str?, Women in Epic Mah?bh?rata (Harvard UP, 2009, and Orient Black Swan, 2011); Jaya, Performance in Epic Mah?bh?rata (HUP, 2011); Heroic K???a, Friendship in Epic Mah?bh?rata (HUP, 2013); and Arjuna P???ava, The Double Hero in Epic Mah?bh?rata (OBS, 2016).


With best wishes, from,


   Kevin.
