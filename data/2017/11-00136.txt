[INDOLOGY] Devanagari and OS 10.12.6
Hello Tyler,
     Yes, I have encountered the same problem with DevanagariQWERTY
keyboard with the new Apple OS.  Often I find that typing the "f" key twice
one can get the conjunct.  This is a problem and I hope the next update
will take care of it.  We need to inform Google about this.
