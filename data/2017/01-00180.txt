[INDOLOGY] J.A.F. Roodbergen 19 October 1925 - 12 January 2017
Dear Jan,
     This is a sad news indeed.  Roodbergen was a giant of a scholar, and
his collaboration with Professor S.D. Joshi proved to be very productive.
Together, these two produced an enormous amount of new research on the
Paninian tradition.
     I am particularly sad, as Roodbergen was my classmate in Pune during
the years 1966-68, along with the Late Jayashree Gune and the Late Pandit
Athalekar.  It was a class of three or four people who use to meet with
Professor Joshi not only for classes at the University of Pune, but daily
at his home for long intensive sessions on the Mahabhashya and the
Paribhashendushekhara.  Roodbergen came to see me at the Pune train
station, when I left by train for Cochin to board my ship to travel to
Philadelphia in July 1968, and I have a photograph of him with me at this
event.  All three of my classmates have now passed away, leaving behind
lots of memories. ?? ?? ?? ????? ???:.
