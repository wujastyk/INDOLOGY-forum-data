These are from the library of Osmania University, Hyderabad.  Philipp Maas
was the first to identify this connection.  They are described in the 1964
catalogue of R. Sharma, which is available at catalogues.indology.info,
Biswas 0401.  The MSS at archive.org are well photographed.  They represent
about a quarter of the MSS in the 1964 catalogue.

Best,
Dominik
