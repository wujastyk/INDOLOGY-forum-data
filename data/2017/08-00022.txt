[INDOLOGY] bhagwa dvaj
Thank you Patrick. Apart from political fantasies, I agree that the science presented by aparently distinguished scientists is not all ?fringe fantasy.?
The philosophy of science issues here are serious, and we should analytically distinguish them from Hindutva political dreams.
Best,
Howard
