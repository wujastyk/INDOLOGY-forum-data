[SILFontNews] Annapurna version 1.203 release
Cc:
AnnapurnaSIL (a Devanagari script font) version 1.203 is a maintenance
release that fixes some Graphite bugs involving reph position chaining
rules and a conjunct half-form. An OpenType rule for the "ra halant ra
halant" sequence was changed to match the Graphite rendering as reph over
ra-halant.
