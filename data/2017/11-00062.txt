[INDOLOGY] Jaina Ramayana e-texts?
Dear All,
I was wondering whether anyone has a searchable e-text of Vimalasuri's Paumacariya and Ravisena's Padmapurana? I have electronic scans of both editions from Hermann Jacobi and Pannalal Jain respectively but neither are searchable.
Any help would be appreciated!
Best wishes,
