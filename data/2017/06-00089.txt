[INDOLOGY] My Sanskrit rendering of Goethe's poem on Shakuntala
Dear Madhav,
As someone who has long loved Goethe's poem, let me say: thank you! This is
beautiful. -- And just in case anyone ever asks about its source: it took
me a while to find it, but it comes from a letter to F. H. Jacobi dated
July 1, 1791, thus quoted in the Jubil?umsausgabe von Goethes Werken,
I.258. (Apologies if you already knew that.)
Thanks again and all best,
    Antonia
