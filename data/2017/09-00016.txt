I recently had an enquiry about a short passage from the Shatapatha
Brahmana.  The passage in question is 7.4.1.1.

Both Titus and Gretil transliterate as follows:

?tmano v? etamadhijanayati y?d???dva j?yate

The "va" following the "y?d???d" is curious, and the several printed
editions (Weber, etc) I checked (and asked colleagues to check...thanks to
Steven Lindquist and Fred Smith) have "vai"

Is there a convention I am missing, or is this an error?

Thanks

Herman Tull
