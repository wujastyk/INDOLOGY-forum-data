[INDOLOGY] Lucid dreaming in Sanskrit?
In recent years there has been a surge of popular books on the topic of 
cultivating one's ability to experience lucid dreams -- that is, dreams 
in which the dreamer is aware that he/she is dreaming and is able to a 
greater or lesser extent to influence the unfolding of dream events; 
extreme clarity and wealth of detail are other commonly reported 
features. Some of these books expound (with varying degrees of 
knowledge, or so it seems to a non-Tibetologist like myself) on the 
connection between lucid dreaming and Tibetan 'dream yoga'. But what 
about Sanskrit sources? Are there any works in Sanskrit -- Buddhist or 
otherwise -- dealing with such states of mind and/or practices? I know 
of works on svapna??stra in the sense of oneiromancy, but that is all.
