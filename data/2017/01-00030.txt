Just a point to ponder:
All other Gotra names with -sa added are three syllable words and
vis'vamitra is a four syllable word. -sa added to vis'vAmitra makes it five
syllables. Probably in comparison to all other four syllable - - - +sa
words vis'vAmitra + sa might sound longer and the reason for avoiding =sa
only in that word could be looking for shorter word length.
