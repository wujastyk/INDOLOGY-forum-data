[INDOLOGY] archaeological survey of western India vol 5- Naneghat Inscription
Dear Dr Mokashi,
I must have gotten it from Google Books at one point, but now I can't find
it there. You can download it here:

B?hler's eye-copies (based on a photolithograph by Pandit Bhagvanlal and a
photograph provided by JAS Burgess) are on the very last page, pp. 217-218
of the PDF.
