[INDOLOGY] Fwd: [SILFontNews] Annapurna version 1.202 release
FYI
[SILFontNews] Annapurna version 1.202 release
AnnapurnaSIL (a Devanagari script font) version 1.202 is a maintenance
release fixing two issues. One was in Graphite where reph was skipping the
aakar after the ya. The second was an issue on Windows computers where the
candrabindu disappeared at certain point sizes in the Bold font. Testing
pointed to a hinting issue. We used TTFautohint instead of FontLab hinting
and testing has shown that it fixed the issue. A bonus from the new process
is it reduces the file size.
Additionally, since no news release was made for Annapurna version 1.201, a
maintenance version was released in August 2016 which fixes two issues. One
was a Graphite reordering issue when reph and ikar are in a cluster. The
second was a Graphite issue affecting typeTuner fonts.
