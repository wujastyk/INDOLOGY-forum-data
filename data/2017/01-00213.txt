Dear Friends,

An independent scholar working in Thailand contacted me out of the blue to
ask whether I had a PDF of Oskar von Hin?ber's "Studien zur Kasussyntax des
P?li, besonders des Vinaya-Pi?aka". In fact I do not, and I could not --as
he could not-- find a copy for sale online of the book itself (published
1968). I have only a bound xerox myself, but I suppose someone has a PDF of
this very valuable work ...?

Jonathan
