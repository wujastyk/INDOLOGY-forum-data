[INDOLOGY] Buddhist Text
 To all,
             I came across the following qoute while going through  a book on Buddhist Philosophy-             
                     " Bauddhanam Sugato Deva Vishwam cha Kshanabhanguram".
        Can anybody may kindly suggest as to which Buddhist philosopher can the above be ascribed to.? I am struggling to find one philosopher who advocated KshanikaVada or Momentaryness?
                              Alakendu Das.
