[INDOLOGY] Buddhavacanam
The Pali doesn't actually say "Buddha's own dialect".  That's the whole
point of the problem and why it has been discussed by many scholars.  It
says "in his own dialect." This is ambiguous: we don't know whether "his
own" (saka) refers to the Buddha or to a person in the audience.   Is the
Buddha saying "teach people in my language" or "teach people in their own
language?"
