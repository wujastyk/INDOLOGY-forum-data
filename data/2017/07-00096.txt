Dear Colleagues, 

I suspect that this seemingly suspicious message is a result of how Dr. Das has forwarded a previous email, and how Prof. Tieken?s mail software has interpreted the forwarded message, as an attached file rather than text. For me, and I suspect for others on the list, there was no file attached to Dr. Das?s email, but rather the email consisted in the following straightforward text message:

So, while what Prof. Kapstein proposes is indeed sensible as a general rule, in this case there does not appear to be any intentional violation of Indology policies or etiquette on the part of Dr. Das, aside from the improper usage of all-caps in the title, which is discouraged to avoid the appearance of shouting. Still, it is an open question as to why a forwarded email should appear as an attachment for some users and as embedded quotation for others, and how it might be solved. It is something that might be worth a closer look by the managing committee, though I cannot guarantee that we can find a solution. 

Best wishes,
Adheesh

All we get here is "Bhamati". I am curious to know if the Indology List has a policy in this matter? Or am I the only one who makes a point of it?
