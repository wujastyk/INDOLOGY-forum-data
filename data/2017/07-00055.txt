Dear Dr. Karp,

There is some information on removing human urine and excrement from 
monastery floors in
volume 1, pp. 150 and 168 of

Karashima, Seishi, trans. 2012. Die Abhisam?c?rik? Dharm??: 
Verhaltensregen fu?r
buddhistische M?nche der Mah?s??ghika-Lokottarav?dins. 3 vols. Tokyo: The
International Research Institute for Advanced Buddhology.

One thing I found very interesting there is that human excrement is 
perceived as
defiling, but cow excrement is perceived as purifying (it is actually 
recommended
for cleaning the floor).

This book may also be useful to you:

Heirman, Ann and Mathieu Torck. 2012. A Pure Mind in a Clean Body: 
Bodily Care in
the Buddhist Monasteries of Ancient India and China. Gent: Academia Press.

I also have a chapter in my dissertation (chapter 4) on Buddhist 
lavatory protocol:

Handy, Christopher Aaron. 2016. ?"Indian Buddhist Etiquette and the 
Emergence of Ascetic Civility.? Ph.D.
Diss. McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario.
