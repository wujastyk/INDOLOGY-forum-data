[INDOLOGY] Buddhism and removal of dirt
Dear Dr. Karp,
There is some information on removing human urine and excrement from 
monastery floors in
volume 1, pp. 150 and 168 of
Karashima, Seishi, trans. 2012. Die Abhisam?c?rik? Dharm??: 
Verhaltensregen fu?r
buddhistische M?nche der Mah?s??ghika-Lokottarav?dins. 3 vols. Tokyo: The
International Research Institute for Advanced Buddhology.
One thing I found very interesting there is that human excrement is 
perceived as
defiling, but cow excrement is perceived as purifying (it is actually 
recommended
for cleaning the floor).
This book may also be useful to you:

Bodily Care in
the Buddhist Monasteries of Ancient India and China. Gent: Academia Press.
I also have a chapter in my dissertation (chapter 4) on Buddhist 
lavatory protocol:
