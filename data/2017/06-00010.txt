[INDOLOGY] Ismail Jogi mantra
Artur-ji,
Spells that you mention belong to the category of Shaabara mantras,
sometimes called siddha mantras or Shaabara Siddha mantras. These are not
in Sanskrit. They are usually in regional Indian languages (including south
Indian languages), particularly their rustic dialects.
Sharing the snapshot of a Hindi article. (Since you know Hindi, you should

Indian languages.
You called hem mysterious. They consider them to be encryption.

be contradictio in adiecto.
