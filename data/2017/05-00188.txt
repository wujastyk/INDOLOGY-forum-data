[INDOLOGY] Place of Origin of Mandana and Vacaspati
The ???kara-vijaya/digvijaya (8.1) texts and (therefore?) at least some modern accounts put Ma??ana-mi?ra in M?hi?mat? / Bihar.  I have not studied the matter in detail. 
For  V?caspati-mi?ra, I have heard Mithil? spoken of as his region. However, until the location of King N?ga mentioned by him in the concluding verses of the Bh?mat? is determined, a definite conclusion does not seem possible. I consider Kar???a(ka) as the best possibility in the present state of our knowledge. See my 2001 article, ?The prologue and epilogue verses of V?caspati-mi?ra-I." Rivista degli Studi Orientali 73: 105-130, which I had attached to my 15 May post.
