Hi Nagaraj, The whole thing will be weighted toward English, but I will
include the most major stuff in some Indian (and other European) languages,
especially the major secondary works in Bengali. This will of course be
somewhat restricted to what I can read, which is pretty much only Bengali
and Hindi. I will also make at least some reference to the translations,
virtually in any Indian language you can name, as you know. There are so
many translations in Indian and other languages that I will not be able to
treat them in great detail. I think there are at least about 10 in Bengali.
I'm sure there might be even more in Oriya. So the short answer is: I will
try not to do an injustice to scholarship in Indian languages, though I
won't be able to treat it comprehensively.
One area of concern is that I cannot read Oriya, and yet I know there must
be at least some good scholarship in Oriya (apart from the flood of more
popular literature).  If you or someone you know can give me some pointers
here I would be very grateful.
Best,J
