[INDOLOGY] Once again on the origin of zero: the date of the Bakhshali manuscript (or manuscripts?)
 Dr.Freschi,
               Thanks for your response. I would mention a link here ,which may be useful to you.
  www.historymuseum.ca/cma/exhibitions/civil/maya/mmc05eng.shtml.( Ref-Canadian Museum of History)
  I would also mention a line from the link,which goes as follows- 'That the Maya understood the value of 
zero is remarkable -most of world's civilisations had no concept of zero at that time'
      The moot point is that the Mayans may not be using zero as a place-value ,as efficiently as the 
Bakshali mms did, but ,if the issue is that of ORIGIN OF ZERO ,then, would be out of place to grant the 
Mayans this honour?
