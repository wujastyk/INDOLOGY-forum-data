[INDOLOGY] Indian criticisms of astrology?
Dear Martin,
The satirical *Kalivi?ambana* by N?laka??ha D?k?ita in the seventeenth
century famously contains a critique of astrologers (*jyauti?ka*), if not
of astrology *per se*, in vv. 14-22. E.g., v. 16:
?yu?pra?ne d?rgham ?yur v?cya? mauh?rtikair janai? |
j?vanto bahu manyante m?t?? prak?yanti ka? puna? ||
"If asked how long one will live,
An astrologer should predict a long life.
Those who survive will think greatly of him;
The dead can't question anybody."
It's possible to read verse 22 as N?laka??ha lumping together astrologers
with "fortune-tellers, dream interpreters, and divine oracles" as equally
bogus charlatans competing with each other.
Regards,
Anand
