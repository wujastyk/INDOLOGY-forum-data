[INDOLOGY] alternative solution for directly accessing Unicode diacritics on Mac
Hello Tyler,
     This is a great suggestion, especially for constructing unusual
combinations, which one often needs while working with P??ini's grammar.
The other thing I want to mention is that I have been interested in
creating stacked diacritics for marking length, nasality and accent on the
same vowel.  I can produce these with Mac's ABC Extended Keyboard.
However, very few fonts can show these properly.  So far, Helvetica is one
font that can show most of the stacks properly, but interestingly, even
this font cannot show stack of three markings on top of "l?".  Fortunately
one does not need this very often, but some P??inian rules may need it.
