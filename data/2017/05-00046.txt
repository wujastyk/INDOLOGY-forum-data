(Siva talking:
"The two reddish and fair, Brahmaa and Vi.s.nu are my two sons.) They are the fine soft hair of the armpits, they have my form and are innocent.
Then he said to Brahmaa: "You resort to (i.e. take) this one quality."
(transl. G.P. Bhatt, AITM 44, pp. 2187-88)



which does not at all correspond to
