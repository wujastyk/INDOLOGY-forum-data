[INDOLOGY] Arai article
Dear Colleagues,
I am looking to obtain, faster than inter-library loan, a copy of an article by Toshikazu Arai, which is entitled ?Jaina Kingship in the Prabandhacint?nma?i? (in Richards? Kingship and Authority in South Asia). I would be most grateful for a scan of it, if anyone has one.
Best Wishes,
