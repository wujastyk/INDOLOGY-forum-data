=?utf-8?Q?[INDOLOGY]_Converting_Gretil_formats_to_devan=C4=81gar=C4=AB?=
Dear Colleagues
I am looking for a digital edition of the critical edition of the Vi??upur??a in devan?gar?. The closest I can get are the texts of the ViP that Peter Schreiner has generously input and which are available on Gretil in CSX, REE and UTF-8 formats.
Is there a way of converting these formats to Devan?gar??  I have found a utility on John Smith's site which looks good, ur2ud, but my Norton security software won't let me run it and deletes it as security threat.
Any advice gratefully received
