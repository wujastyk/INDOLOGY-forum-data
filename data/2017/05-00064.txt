Dear Peter, (cc: INDOLOGY)

good to hear Kazuo came to the rescue once again (as he so often does on 
such matters)! I guess, then, that RS was lucky with these photographs, 
or his self-assessment as a poor photographer in MJY is overstated.

The second volume (1950) of Meri Jivan Yatra with the accounts on the 
Tibetan journeys (1929-30, 1934, 1936 and 1938) can be found as PDF in 
the DLI: http://www.dli.ernet.in/handle/2015/428822.

Indeed, MJY makes for worthwhile reading, for many reasons!

Best, Birgit
