I could not read the article

Ouseparambil, Philosophy of Gender in Sanskrit and Indo-European. (Based on
a 1980 thesis submitted to SVU Tirupati)

'Gender' as a linguistic aspect of languages like Sanskrit is different
from the contemporary sociological issue of 'gender'.

The distinction of grammatical 'gender' of words from the sex of the
entities (not limited to human beings nor to the animate) denoted by those
words is different from the distinction of the sociological/political
category of 'gender' of human beings from the biological category of 'sex'
of human beings.
