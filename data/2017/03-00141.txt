[INDOLOGY] ATTANTYA ABHAVA -Revisited
   A couple of months back  an impressive  discussion on Attantya Abhava was held on this site, 
based on my query. I  felt enriched . However, the issue of Attantya Abhava  had been bothering 
me still, as a result of which I made some further readings. I found Annambhatta' Text 'Tarka-
Samgraha' the sole exception. It is the only text I came across ( not even Bhatta's SlokaBartick)
which takes' BHUTALE  GHATO NASTI'( i.e the pot is not in this plane) as an instance of Attantya-
Abhava.
               According to it, the pot   bears a space -time relation with the plane ( Kaal Desh 
Bishistha Sambandha Swarup).It is something like this- At time t the pot was not  on the plane. 
the pot was  placed on the plane at time t1. The time t when the pot was not on the plane , would 
never  come back to existence at point of time  in past ,present future.  It gets lost into a 
multi-spatial absence.This absence is Trikaal-Abadhita.
