[INDOLOGY] Katyayana Smriti Ed. Bandyopadhyaya
Dear Dr. Mokashi,
I have this edition (without a title page) of the K?ty?yana-smr?ti, that is
different from the K?ty?yana-smr?ti-s?roddh?ra edited by P.V. Kane.  This
looks like an extracted text from a large collection of Smr?tis.  This is
definitely not from the Anandashram collection of Smr?tis.  A Calcutta
edition?
