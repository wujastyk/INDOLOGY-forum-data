???????? is used in three different meanings in the following three verses
in Gita:
???????????????? ??????????? ???????? ? 2\-11?
?????????????????? ????????? ??? ??????? ?
???? ??? ??????? ? ???????? ????????? ? 5\-18?
???????????? ???????????? ????????? ? ???????? ?
????????????? ?????????????????? ??????? ? 5\-4?
In the first, Arjuna is being called Pandita and he is being told that it
is not appropriate for Arjuna to lament.
But in the second, Pandita is almost equivalent of sthitaprajna, a person
with the highest level of spiritual attainment as per the book.
In the third, it is in contrast with baalaah.
