Subject: [INDOLOGY] Grammar of the Jain phrase
Message-ID: <CAB3-dzdhqCKiywU-fgDicA0Cqo8+V1HTxhu7o1K0JWp3kA4j_Q@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Colleagues,

     Someone recently asked me the meaning of the Jain phrase "micch?mi
dukka?am".  On most of the web sources, the explanation is given like this:
micch? mi dukka?am (Skt. mithy? me du?kr?tam) meaning "May my evil deed be
ineffective".  I am wondering whether micch?mi in this phrase is originally
"m?+icch?mi" and the phrase meaning: "May I not wish evil."  In several
textual contexts, micch?mi occurs with other first person singular verbs
like kh?memi: ???????? ???????? ?????? ???? ????, ????? ???? ????? ???  I
will appreciate any light that our Prakrit scholars can shed on this.  With
best wishes,

Madhav Deshpande
