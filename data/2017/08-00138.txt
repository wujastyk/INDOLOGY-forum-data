[INDOLOGY] Grammar of the Jain phrase
Dear Colleagues,
     Someone recently asked me the meaning of the Jain phrase "micch?mi
dukka?am".  On most of the web sources, the explanation is given like this:
micch? mi dukka?am (Skt. mithy? me du?kr?tam) meaning "May my evil deed be
ineffective".  I am wondering whether micch?mi in this phrase is originally
"m?+icch?mi" and the phrase meaning: "May I not wish evil."  In several
textual contexts, micch?mi occurs with other first person singular verbs
like kh?memi: ???????? ???????? ?????? ???? ????, ????? ???? ????? ???  I
will appreciate any light that our Prakrit scholars can shed on this.  With
best wishes,
Madhav Deshpande
