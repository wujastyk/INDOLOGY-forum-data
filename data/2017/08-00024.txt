[INDOLOGY] PDF scan copy
Dear Indology list members,
I am looking for a copy of Ahobala?s Vir?paks?vasantotsavacamp? (ed. by Panchamukhi, 1953); unfortunately I was not able to recover a pdf of this edition anywhere and, moreover, it seems that DLI is not working again due to copyright violation.
Thanking you in advance, my best wishes for a great summer and good work.
