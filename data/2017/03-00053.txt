Dear Dr. Tieken,

I meant to say that if vitai in vitaippu?am were to be considered an adjectival participle since the commentator has explained vitaippu?am  as vitaitta kollai, the gemination of ?p? does not make sense. While vitaitta kollai has the past adjectival participle, vitaitta, the poem has vitai-p-. If vitai (to sow) were to function as an adjectival participle, then it should be part of a vi?aittokai (k?lam karanta peyar eccam) compound. In this compound, the initial plosive of the second member does not double. Since the plosive doubles, the first member is a noun, vitai (seed). 

As for the specific meaning of itai, ?sail? (marakkalap p?y) and ?newly cultivated land? (putuppu?am) are given in the Tiv?karam, the earliest Tamil nigha???, which also separately glosses itaippu?am as putukkollai, which is shown in the Tamil Lexicon. ?Chowlee-bean' is found in the later lexicon, the Pi?kalam. In the context discussed here, the meaning ?sail? can be easily discarded. As for 'Chowlee-bean?, it can be discarded because we have in Akam 394 common millet  (varaku) being grown in itaippu?am. So, the meaning of itaippu?am as a 'newly cultivated field? is not an ad hoc invention. 

Regards,
Palaniappan

Does the doubling of the initial plosive p of the second member pu?am necessarily point to a case relation between the members of the (Tatpuru?a) compound?

First of all, if vitaippu?am were to be considered an adjectival participle (vitaitta kollaiyi?) as the commentator has considered, the gemination of ?p? does not make sense. Also, it is highly unlikely that a cultivated field is qualified in a convoluted way as a field sown with seeds which grow to be with leaves like sapphire.

Later commentators like Peruma?aippulavar have simply followed Nacci??rkki?iyar without considering Tamil Lexicon?s insight. Does anybody know if this issue has been discussed by any other scholar?

In an earlier post, I had suggested that a similar misinterpretation has led to the word i?a?kar being mistaken for vi?a?kar and used in a 16th century text. (http://list.indology.info/pipermail/indology_list.indology.info/2015-January/040561.html <http://list.indology.info/pipermail/indology_list.indology.info/2015-January/040561.html>) The case of vitaippu?am in Malaipa?uka??m 102 suggests that vi?a?kar was not an isolated case.)
