[INDOLOGY] Literature on Minakshi and Gauri puja
Dear list,
I don't know whether this translation has already been mentioned by some:
The fish-eyed Goddess of Madurai, Pillaittamil, Maalai and Kuram by 
Kumaraguruparar,
Translated by Kausalya Hart, Dept. of South and Southeast Asian Studies, 
University of California, Berkeley, 2011.
Best wishes
