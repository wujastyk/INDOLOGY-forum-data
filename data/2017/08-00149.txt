Dear all
In Raghuvamsa 6th Canto and Verse 58 or 59
???????????? ?????? ???? first foot says about Nagapura or Uragapura
Mallinatha explains as ??????????????????????????? but this seems to be a
mistake as Kanouj is on the North of India , whereas the poet in further
verses clearly places it on the south.
And on further search I found Arunagirinatha and Narayana in the commentary
to the above mentioned verse give the details as the place  in the bank of
the river ???????
?????????? ??????? ??? ??? ??????? ??????? ???? ???????????...
Does any one knows about this river or its modern name kindly inform.
I also believe that even Mallinatha has written ??????? as the name is not
famous that must be due to ??????????? scribal error occurred
Thanks
