Section 19, Computational Sanskrit and Digital Humanities
17th World Sanskrit Conference
Vancouver, Canada ? July 9-13, 2018
Convenors: G?rard Huet & Amba Kulkarni

Dear Colleagues,

FULL papers are invited on original and unpublished research on various aspects of Computational Linguistics and Digital Humanities related to Sanskrit (Classical and Vedic), Prakrit, Pali, Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit, etc. Accepted papers are to be published in advance of the WSC 2018 meetings in July 2018, or soon thereafter.

Scholars interested in participating in Section 19 (Computational Sanskrit and Digital Humanities) should submit an abstract as usual through the submission portal (https://wsc.ubcsanskrit.ca/ocs/wsc/2018/schedConf/cfp) , but must also attach a complete paper as a PDF at step 3 of the process (?Upload Supplementary Files?). These manuscript submissions will be reviewed by members of the Programme Committee, as given below. To prepare your manuscript for submission and to procure the relevant LaTeX style files, you may download the WSC2018-Section 19 Support Package and follow the additional instructions given on the WSC2018 Section 19 Website (https://wsc.ubcsanskrit.ca/section-19/).

The deadline for submitting papers for consideration is OCTOBER 1, 2017. For further information and guidance, please email the WSC2018 Secretariat HERE (mailto:wsc2018 at ubcsanskrit.ca) .
