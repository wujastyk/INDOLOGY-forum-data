[INDOLOGY] Rudra gayatri
We may find the reference of six headed Siva (Bhadresvara) from the inscription of Champa (Myson stone slab inscription of Jaya Indravarman II, dated 1088 AD).

 [INDOLOGY] Rudra gayatri
Dear list members,
Happy new year.
There is a Rudra gayatri in a text in the Muktabodha digital library called par?kramap?j? as follows:
?a?anan?yavidmahe 
citrap?d?yadh?mahi?tanno rudra pracoday?t
1) Why??a?anan?ya ?? Is there a form of Shiva with 6 faces??
2) How would?citrap?da be translated in this context?
Thanks,
Harry Spier
