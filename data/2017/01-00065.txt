We may find the reference of six headed Siva (Bhadresvara) from the inscription of Champa (Myson stone slab inscription of Jaya Indravarman II, dated 1088 AD).

Dear list members,
Happy new year.
There is a Rudra gayatri in a text in the Muktabodha digital library called par?kramap?j? as follows:
?a?anan?yavidmahe 
citrap?d?yadh?mahi?tanno rudra pracoday?t
1) Why??a?anan?ya ?? Is there a form of Shiva with 6 faces??
2) How would?citrap?da be translated in this context?

Thanks,
Harry Spier
