[INDOLOGY] an odd Sanskrit phrase
Dear friends,
One of my students is writing her thesis on a Tibetan tantric lineage that specialised on,
among other things, the rituals devoted to a form of the bodhisattva Ma?ju?r? called
gsang-ldan, literally "possessing secrets," i.e. "esoteric." At least one of the canonical texts cited, which however
does not survive in Sanskrit, includes a Sanskrit title in which gsang-ldan is found as guhy?panna.
Although some contemporary specialists of Buddhism have, on this basis, repeated the use of the phrase
guhy?panna, it appears to me most likely to stem from a Tibetan back translation and not from
an original Sanskrit source - - the use of ?panna in the meaning intended somehow doesn't seem
right to me.
I would appreciate any insights you might have on whether guhy?panna meaning "possessing secrets"
is at all plausible. Please do not bother with citations of scholars who have used the phrase, referring
to Tibetan but not actual Sanskrit sources.
with thanks in advance,
