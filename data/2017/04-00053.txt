[INDOLOGY] Help with Ramayana
Thank you, Camillo. You and I agree.
I inserted ?primordial,? since this traditional, faith-based Hindu scholar argues that writing "has always been there.?  I?m sure and I have the same view on this matter, but I was trying to be gentle with him on text-critical issues, dating etc, so that he didn?t flame up on me.
Anyway, your help is much appreciated.
Best wishes,
Howard
