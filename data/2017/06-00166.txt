Subject: [INDOLOGY] 3. Warder Sanskrit Reader (James Hegarty) (Digest, Vol 53, Issue 21)
Message-ID: <CALPiqiuam3QXHituJfQdu-gOFHfWzd=igO7YkFBYjk7ViEMvcA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Colleagues,

I'd be happy to get a copy of Warder's "Reader" as well. There is no copy
in Munich , and, I guess, in entire Germany as well.

Kind regards,
