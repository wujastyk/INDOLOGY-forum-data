  Dr.Tieken
             I  feel so relieved on getting your reply. 
                         The question which I  was asking is something like this-  
                       While going through the book 'Bhamati' by Bachaspati Mishra( 8-9th CE) 
,I came across the following argument preferred by the Purvapakshis -
            ''  ?? ?? ?????????? ?????????? ????????? ?????????? ????'
     i.e. Atha Yad Asandigdham Aproyojonam Prekshavat Pratipitsa Gochara
 What is the implication of the word' ????????? ??????????? ( Prekshavat Pratipitsa )
                                                       ALAKENDU DAS
