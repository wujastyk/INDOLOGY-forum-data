I would like to draw on the collective manuscript reading experience of our list members. A Sanskrit word pa?gu is well known in dictionaries and printed texts. It denotes a ?lame person?. In a passage of the ms of svadita?kara??  (a palm leaf Malayalam script ms), a commentary on ny?yaka?ik?, this word appears only as pa?ku with many repetitions in a long comment on a line in vidhiviveka?.. It is possible to argue that this reading pa?ku should be corrected to pa?gu, because pa?ku and pa?gu are both pronounced the same in the Malayalam language (i.e., the k is pronounced as g). This argument, however, seems weak to me. First, other words like prasa?ga always appear as expected in the svadita?kara?? ms. Second, a most likely 16th century devan?gar? ms of ny?yaka?ik? certainly reads pa?ku in two of the three occurrences of pa?gu later in the commentary, and probably in all three of them (the first fifty or so folia of this ms, that would include the passage on which svadita?karra?? comments, are not available). In two of these instances, we see a correction to pa?gu, but one stands uncorrected. Third, the ms. of ju?adhva?kara?? (also a palm leaf Malayalam script ms) reads pa?ku a few times, and also consistently renders words like prasa?ga as expected.

I have two questions. First, have you seen the reading pa?ku, especially in mss not written in South Indian scripts? Second, are there any etymological or other discussions of the term pa?gu / pa?ku not referenced in standard works like Burrows' and Emeneau?s DED or the Turners?  CDIAL?
