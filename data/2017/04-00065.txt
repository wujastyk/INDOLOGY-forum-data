[INDOLOGY] question about mixed oral/manuscript transmission
The list is bigger.
The narrative in Sriharsha's Naishadha Kavya has several Telugu folk oral
epic (performance and) textual versions with the name of
Naladamayantikatha.
Apart from the profoundly scholarly (naarikeLapaaka ) Epic poetic
translation by Srinathudu ( the author of Palnati Veeracharitramu ) of
Sanskrit Naishadham, there is a Desi (folkish) translation of the same by
Raghunathanayakudu.
Saarangadharacharitramu is another such narrative popular in the folk oral
epic narrative repertoire, while having classical style epic poetic forms
and verse-theater forms of modern times.
There are more.
