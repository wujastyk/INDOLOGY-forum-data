The recognitior of ancient stone quarries at chunar hills with dateble epigraphs was a startling discovery made by the author of this book, in the year 1990. the followup archaological field investigations around chunar and Varanasi, which were carried out between the years 1990 and 1994, have uncovered the entire process of stone carving which was prevalent during the historical period in the Ganga plains. Besides archaeological investigations, ethnological surveys were also carried out. As a result of which it has been possible, start from quarrying of stone carving process, start from quarrying of stone blocks, their transportation to the centres of utility-carving of the sculpturing centres and the main religious centres etc.

Dear List,

Has anyone studied - and written on - the mode of transport of A?okan
pillars out of the quarry in Chunar, dst. Mirzapur, Uttar Pradesh?

The Firoz Shah Kotla Pillar (brought by Firoz from Ambala dst., Haryana) is
a sandstone monolith nearly 13 m. in height, and it weighs close to 27
tons.

Regards,
