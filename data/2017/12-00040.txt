[INDOLOGY] Paharpur
Dear Peter,
The pdf version from the Central Archaeological Library that I downloaded a short while ago does not seem to be missing the plates.
Just in case they may be of interest to you, here are two references for recent articles on Paharpur:
Lef?vre, Vincent. 2012. ?P?h?rpur, une ?uvre de circonstance?? In Orientalismes de l?arch?ologie au mus?e: m?langes offerts ? Jean-Fran?ois Jarrige, edited by Vincent Lef?vre, 237?53. Turnhout: Brepols.
???. 2014. ?The Hindu Sculptures from P?h?rpur Reconsidered.? In South Asian Archaeology and Art: Changing Forms and Cultural Identity, Religious and Secular Iconographies. Vol. 1. Papers from the 20th Conference of the European Association for South Archaeology and Art Held in Vienna from 4th to 9th of July 2010, edited by Deborah E. Klimburg-Salter and Linda Lojda, 131?42. Turnhout: Brepols.
Best wishes,
Arlo

Dear colleagues,
Does anyone have a good scan of R. B. K. N. Dikshit's Excavations at Paharpur, Bengal (MASI no. 55), 1938? The ones I could find online are missing the plates.
Many thanks,
Peter Szanto
