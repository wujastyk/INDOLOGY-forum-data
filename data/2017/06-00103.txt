Dear All,
does anyone know what kind of disease the P?li word kucchiroga (skt. kuk?iroga) stands for? 
Or is it only a collective term for several diseases? I found as translations: disorders of abdomen,
 abdominal trouble, belly-disease.
In Mah?va?sa 37.113 a snake has this disease, and it has a swelling or boil (ga??a) on its belly.
Monks from Sri Lanka who travelled to India in 1852 and the following years
fell ill with kucchiroga after  their arrival in N?gapa??a, India. Several of them died.
Any information is welcome,
Petra Kieffer-P?lz
