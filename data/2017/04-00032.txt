The second one could correspond to R?mapurattu V?ryar?s work.
There must exist several other translations in Malayalam.

Testifying for the immense popularity of the GG in Kerala : in the Malayam novel The Legend of Khasak (khas?kki??e itih?sa?) by O. V. Vijayan (1969, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khasakkinte_Itihasam ), at the end of the chapter 9 examined by Francis Zimmermann (http://ginger.tessitures.org/malayalam/fiction-contemporaine/khasak/ ) a anonymous Sanskrit stanza is quoted, which is, as I myself noticed, nothing else than GG 1.16.
