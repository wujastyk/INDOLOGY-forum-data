It is not hieroglyphics but most likely another type of "writing" that is called logo-syllabic ...? or one of the other options have already been discussed in this thread, like a sign system.

Best,
Dean

 Dr.Anderson,
 Thanks everybody for elaborating on the matter 


 However, ,in this connection I would like to qoute a few lines from Pg 19 of the book 'An 
Advanced History of India' by Dr.R.C. Majumdar et al ( Publisher -MACMILLAN, First edition 
1946,Latest Reprint 1988), which says, in a Chapter on IVC - ' More than five hundred seals have 
been disccoverd....... made of Terra-Cotta .All of them contain ,a short record inscribed in a 
sort of pictorial writing ,which still remians undeciphered.'

 My question is -;Whether it implies what we call hieroglyphics?


 ALAKENDU DAS.
