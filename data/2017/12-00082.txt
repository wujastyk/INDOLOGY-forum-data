SUMMARY: The present book contains a series of lectures delivered at the 
?cole Pratique des Hautes ?tudes (Paris) in March 2015 and at the Savitribai 
Phule Pune University (Pune) in October and November 2015. This volume 
grew out of efforts to teach the textual criticism of Sanskrit works in theory 
and practice. It covers the general theory of textual criticism, its history and 
practice in Sanskrit studies, and tries to offer concrete examples of newly 
edited texts in order to show that Sanskrit editing is not so much a specialist 
knowledge, but a basic skill for Sanskrit readers.

"To edit or not to edit" will appeal to specialists with interests in fields such 
as Sanskrit philology and textual criticism, history of Indology, old, medieval, 
and modern Sanskrit texts from Kashmir, as well as Indo-Persian studies.

With best wishes,
