[INDOLOGY] Once again on the origin of zero: the date of the Bakhshali manuscript (or manuscripts?)
  Camillo,
           Sorry for replying late,but I took some time to have a deeper look into the history of 
the Babylonian concept of zero.
                                   I enclose a qoute from Mathemetician  Robert Kaplan ...and 
leave the rest for you to decide.
                                                          ALAKENDU DAS.
