[INDOLOGY] Gita meter
Hello Edwin,
     In her article "The Mahabharata's Core" (1975), Mary Carroll Smith has
argued that there was an ancient core of the Mahabharata in Tri??ubh
verses, which was later expanded by the addition of the narrative in
Anu??ubh.  I am not sure how this would account for the metrical variation
in the Bhagavadgita, but there is a suggestion from this article.
