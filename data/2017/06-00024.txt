I found an interesting reference in A. C. Burnell's The Ordinances of Manu,
(Intro. p. xxxvii) to a work titled An?c?ranir?aya composed in Kerala to
discuss "deviations" from Brahmanical Dharma??stras.  According the
footnote on this page, this work was evidently attributed to ?a?kara.  This
may be the source of ??ma??str? Dravi?a Dvivedi using the expression
?c?rya??padagdha to refer to these regions.  Here is the passage from
Burnell:

I wonder if anyone has come across this work titled An?c?ranir?aya.  Any
help?
