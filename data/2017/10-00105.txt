[INDOLOGY] Northern and southern Devanagari
I notice inconsistent use of p???ham?tr? similar to the use Madhav reported in the oldest manuscript of ny?yaka?ik? available to me. My impression is that the original copyist generally used p???ham?tr? but used non p???ham?tr? forms in some instances to correct what he originally wrote. I must stress that this is only am impression!
