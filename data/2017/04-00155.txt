[INDOLOGY] Sanskrit literature in numbers
than you think.
Your own recent Shaw-related assessment (?A Bird?s Eye View of Sanskrit
Print Culture?),
being in this respect similar to the one in Dominik Wujastyk?s (?Indian
Manuscripts?, 2011:3f.) short overview (unfortunately omitting any
reference to VOHD) represents also
my state of awareness.
conveying one?s own
research and ideas, surely not a mailing list.
Without wishing to defend my vices, this rather socio-historical and
politico-philosophical
issue of the context-related relative merit/benefit for the production
and/or provocation of
insights that contrasts institutional normativity with spontaneous alterity
is indeed not suitable to be addressed within the framework of this thread.
All the best, just another Cracking Sound
