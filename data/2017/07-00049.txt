[INDOLOGY] Ayur Veda Question
The discussion of ?menstrual blood? and ?fecund blood? in Rahul Peter Das's very detailed study The Origin of the Life of a Human Being: Conception and the Female According to Ancient Indian Medical and Sexological Literature would be a good place to look for references.
All the best,
