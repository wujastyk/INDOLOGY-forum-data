[INDOLOGY] Fwd: A question
A student working on this text called ?K?laj?anm? asked me about the three letters at the very beginning that precede ??r?ga?e??y nama??. I myself could not make it out, but thought it may be ?arpa?a? ? but that is an educated guess, taking the first letter as ?a? second as ?p? (although it does not look like it), and the third an retroflex ???. Any help appreciated. Perhaps these letters are not standard Devanagari.
Thanks.
Patrick
