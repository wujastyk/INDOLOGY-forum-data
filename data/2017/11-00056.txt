[INDOLOGY] Sources on Relationship btw Oral/Literary Traditions
In the margin of this thread, or as a very special case, following this article just issued in the Hindu
http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/strings-attached/article19982142.ece
attention can be drawn to the traditional shadow-puppetry performed in several Bhagavati temples of Palakkad, Malappuram and Thrissur Distr. of Kerala, called To?lp?vak?ttu. See, with a focus on the relationship between oral and literary traditions, the work of Stuart Blackburn, Inside the Drama-House: R?ma Stories and Shadow Puppets in South India, Berkeley: University of California Press, 1996 ? e-version here: http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft5q2nb449;brand=ucpress (cf. also Gopal Venu, Tolpava Koothu: Shadow Puppets in Kerala, New Delhi: Sangeet Natak Akademi, 1990; Laurent Aubert, Les Feux de la D?esse: Rituels villageois du Kerala (Inde du Sud), Lausanne: Payot, 2004, pp. 107-121). Here attached the picture no. 2 in the article, showing the manuscripts (in Malayalam script for the one readable) attached to the oral performances (on the basis of the Kampan Rm stanzas, with written and free amplifications, the former called ??alp???u, mixing Tamil, Malayalam and Sanskrit), preserved (?...) by the puppeteers.
