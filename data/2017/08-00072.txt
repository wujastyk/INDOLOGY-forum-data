Dear Dr. Stern,
Thank you for the information.
Now I understand why this wrong reading crept into the data. It is
interesting that Jacobi's edition which I have reads correctly "panku"; see
the attached photos, while the PDF, taken from the archive.org., reads
mistakenly "pauku".  His index reads rightly "panka". I am happy to know
that I have a copy of  the corrected version of Jacobi's dissertation paper.
With best regards,
Seishi Karashima
