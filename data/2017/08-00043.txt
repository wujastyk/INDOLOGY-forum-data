[INDOLOGY]  sex and gender
Dear Shyam:
 The following may be of interest to your friend. Ouseparambil discusses
biological and grammatical gender as considered in the *Mah**?**bh**??**ya,
V**?**kyapad**?**ya* and other grammatical treatises in Sanskrit.  I don?t
have a copy at hand to give more details (publisher etc.), but I remember
that it was published privately by the author.  A useful synopsis of the
discussion over grammatical gender (??str?ya li?ga) can also be found in
the introduction of Madhav Deshpande?s ?The meaning of nouns?.
Padmanabh Jaini?s important compilation of material related to the debates
over possibility of salvation for ?female?? souls is a useful source for
some jaina discussions.
Tryambaka-yajvan?s  (Sanskrit) Str?dharma-paddhati is a 18th century
instruction manual for good wives; it is available in translation as ?The
Perfect Wife?; and Sa?ci Honnamma?s (Kannada ) Hadibadeya Dharma (17th
cent.) is a similar text, with rare subversive moments. Blake Michael?s
essay is helpful to get a picture of the Virasaiva doctrinal attitude
towards women , and Mullatti?s discussion of the same topic is informative
(if at all), rather than insightful.
I giver fuller citations below.

Dear all,
This is a question from a colleague who is not on the list. This
colleague teaches a course on Sex and Gender theory and is interested in
articles that addresses the topic from differing cultural vantages. I
was asked about what was available on the topic that discusses the issue
from the perspective of the Indian tradition.  I didn't know what to
say. I'd be grateful for any suggestions.
Thanks,
Shyam
