[INDOLOGY] women in the harem
In addition to the evidence found in the Jaina texts, one can notice *orodhe
*LocSg  ?in the harem? (Mah?vastu 1.143.7, 1.200.3, 2.3.21) resulting from
the alternation *ava*- ~ *o*- (cf. Geiger,   A P?li Grammar. Translated
into English by B. Ghosh. Revised and Edited by K.N. Norman,  Oxford: The
Pali Text Society,  1994, ? 26), but no *ava*-form of this word seems to be
recorded in BHS.
