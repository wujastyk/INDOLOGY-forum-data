[INDOLOGY] Buddhasrijnana's Abhisamaya commentary
Dear Ashok et al.,
This seems to be referring primarily to Tibetan manuscript holdings; it is not at all
clear the Rahula's photographs of Skt. mss. are involved. And the idea of translating
a whole collection of Tibetan mss. into Hindi, without assessing the collection
in relation to on-going Tibetological work, merely reflects the regrettable ignorance on
the part of the concerned administration regarding what it is that they actually hold.
The Tibetan collection has been surveyed here:
