[INDOLOGY] Kota Rajya ka Itihas by Mathuralal Sharma
Dear Members,
does anyone on the list have access to a copy of Kota Rajya ka Itihas ????
????? ?? ?????? by Mathuralal Sharma ???????? ?????? I believe the book was
first published in or around 1939 (Vikram Samvat 1996), and there is a 2008
second edition published in Jodhpur. No library I have access to seems to
have a copy. I would be delighted if a kindly soul coul look it up and scan
a few pages for me (or just photograph them with a mobile phone). What I
need is Sharma's transcript of the inscriptions at Charchoma ??????? Temple
(???????? ??????), along with anything he has to say about these
inscriptions. The location is Appendix 2 of volume 1. I'm afraid I do not
have a more precise reference.
Thank you,
Daniel
