Hi Jessie,

I would strongly recommend Gangadhara Bhatt in Mysore. He has recently retired and has experience working with foreign students.

Yours,
Ajay

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Ny?ya Pandit

Dear Friends, I have a student who is focused very intently on Ny?ya and pram??av?da, who is getting ready to take his first trip to India to study with a traditional Pandit. Whom would people recommend especially for this discipline? I know of some Pandits who are all very capable in Ny?ya, but I wonder if there are Pandits you might know of with an especial passion for the topic. Best,??????,J
