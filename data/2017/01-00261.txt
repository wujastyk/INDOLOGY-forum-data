[INDOLOGY] Skt vocabulary from the title pages and prefaces of Sanskrit editions
Nope, you have expressions like s'uddha prati = copy which is s'uddha ,
copy which underwent s'odhana (s'odhana = search for impurities, removal of
impurities, cleaning up to remove impurities, you know , you are an
Ayurveda man)
So "sa??odhita is a Sanskrit back-translation of the English word "edited"
is not always the case.
