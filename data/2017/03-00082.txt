Between the end of the 18th and the start of the 19th century, India was
becoming a major academic subject throughout Europe. The discovery that
many words in the ancient Indian language Sanskrit (e.g., dasha ? ten,
akshi ? eye, matr ? mother, pitr ? father) had cognates in classical Greek
(deca, ophthalmos, m?t?r, pat?r) and Latin (decem, oculus, mater, pater)
captured the imaginations of philologists, such as Sir William Jones, H.T.
Colebrooke, Charles Wilkins, and August and Friedrich Schlegel. Their
translations of Sanskrit literature into English, French, and German
introduced new Western audiences to the study of world philosophies and
religions. (For example, Henry David Thoreau?s writings referenced and
quoted from the 1785 Wilkins translation of the Bhagavad Gita, an important
Hindu sacred text). Ultimately, what emerged from the work of the early
philologists was Indology ? the scholarly discipline predicated on
understanding India chiefly through its ancient texts and languages.
