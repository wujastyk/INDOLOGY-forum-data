"Those who have the privilege to know Padoux personally, have been
impressed by his friendliness, his cultured style, his honesty and
meticulous correctness, his high scientific standard, and his readiness to
assist young Indologists, both French and non-French."
When in the early nineties I read these words in Teun Goudriaan's preface
to *Ritual and Speculation in Early Tantrism -- Studies in Honor of Andr?
Padoux*, Albany: SUNY press, 1992, Andr? Padoux was for me an admired but
distant star.
Much later I had myself the privilege to experience directly the truth of
this statement on Andr? Padoux, and be in addition impressed by his
evergreen sense of humour and his loyalty to his family, friends and close
colleagues. His work will forever remain of monumental importance for
Indology, Tantric Studies, Ritual Studies, Philosophy of Language,
Mantra??stra and for the humanities (sciences humaines) in general.
Condolences to his family and friends.
I hope someone will be so kind as to prepare, or point us to, an updated
list of Andr? Padoux' publications -- beyond the list that appeared in the
1992 SUNY volume.
