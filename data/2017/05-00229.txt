Dear Colleagues,
As far as I am concerned, falsification of historical evidence should be
called by its proper term. .
There is a difference between "he might have been" and "he was".
A?oka's person is an object of sanctification, whatever the reasons behind
it. His Edicts are routinely decontextualized. Dr. Ambedkar's statement,
re: removal of idols, is a good example of such practice.
Best,
Artur K.
