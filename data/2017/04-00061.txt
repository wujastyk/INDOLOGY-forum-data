In the earliest Vedic texts no trace is found of the pada-plus-samhita
technique of transmission. We find, on the contrary, familiarity with a
relaxed "frog-style" transmission from fathers to their sons. Especially in
the second article it is argued that the peculiar pada-plus-samhita
technique (or pada-plus-krama-plus-samhita technique, if you like)
developed in the 6th century B.C. when North-West India was confronted with
another epoch-making innovation, alphabetic or near-alphabetic script which
emphatically distinguished WORDS -- scribes of Persian cuneiform were hence
confronted with "sandhi" problems, not relevant to scribes of syllabic or
hieroglyphic scripts. These "sandhi" problems subsequently also passionated
contemporary transmittors of the Veda. Summary: the Indian textual
tradition testifies to an intensive interface between orality and writing
over a period of around two millennia (relevant also to Sanskrit texts).
