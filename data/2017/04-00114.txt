[INDOLOGY] Sanskrit literature in numbers
Dear Camillo,
I must admit I am a bit uncertain where to draw the line. Trying to
quantify Latin literature, I think I would want total numbers that could
then be split up in classical and then everything later? I am not sure what
the cut off date would be.
Best, Dagmar
