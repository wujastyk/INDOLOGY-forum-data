Subject: [INDOLOGY] Lucid dreaming in Sanskrit?
In-Reply-To: <CAEzwJrAyQsOBiJ8Tx+DaJPqRh7jtRLvgf+5R8qGCNQY5kcBuvw@mail.gmail.com>
Message-ID: <82C3E42590D939418C74DD76B97DDED047C6309F@xm-mbx-06-prod>

I forgot to add that the mahAjagrat "great awakening" of the MokSopaya,
discussed by Juergen Hanneder in his very interesting contribution to
http://indologica.de/drupal/?q=node/652
( a book that may be in any case pertinent)
also seems to intimate lucid dreaming. As Hanneder puts it (p. 93)
"a dream world (svapna) becomes a new waking state...."
