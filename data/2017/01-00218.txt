Dear Dominik,
Thank you for sharing your thoughts on this. ?I have thus far found Academia.edu to be an unqualified good, both in terms of circulating my own work to a wider audience and accessing the work of colleagues easily, as well as connecting with new and especially younger colleagues in the field. ?I appreciate (and am reassured by) your candid assessment of Bond's article.
All the best,Jeff?Dr. Jeffery D. Long

 Many of us use Academia.edu as a shop-window for our publications and our academic identity. ?
There was a piece by Sarah Bond published in Forbes on Monday this week that raises a number of criticisms of Academia.edu, and recommends deleting your Academia.edu account. ?
I've read Bond's piece carefully, and I find its arguments extremely weak.? I don't wish to do a point-by-point rejoinder here.? But I do want to signal to colleagues that Bond's alarmist critique of Academia.edu is something that I personally will ignore. ?
I remain very happy with Academia.edu, while recognizing that there are some issues that require vigilance and discussion.? I have written to Richard Price the founder of Academia.edu and a former Fellow of All Souls, Oxford, more than once in the past, and he has always answered personally and discussed my concerns seriously.? Similarly with other staff members.? The areas where Academia.edu might need to watch its step are areas that apply to all other similar services.? The benefits that Academia.edu offers its users are substantial, for a combination of hosting research, for subject-specific awareness alerts, for networking, and for analytics.? I see no competitor out there that quite offers the same ecosystem with the same combination of benefits. ?
Best,Dominik Wujastyk
