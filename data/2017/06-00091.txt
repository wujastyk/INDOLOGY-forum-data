[INDOLOGY] My Sanskrit rendering of Goethe's poem on Shakuntala
Dear Professor Deshpande,
I seek your kind permission to add an insignificant remark on this amiable
and spotless couplet:
Goethe did not address the play (??kuntala), but its heroine (?akuntal?).
A capital letter such as "D" of the German spelling "Dich" - if it does
correspond with the original spelling - in the above quote normally marks a
form of personal address. I think the English translator, too, understood
Goethe's wording as a personal address: "[...] thee, O Sakuntala!"
It is of course possible that Goethe actually might have had the drama as
such in his mind, when he praised "Sakontala" - the person - in place of
the play.
He knew the play by the title Georg Foster had assigned to it, in which the
name of ?akuntal? occupies the first place: "Sakontala, oder der
entscheidende Ring, ein indisches Schauspiel von Kalidas."
?Sakontala?, in Goethe?s understanding and usage, is also elsewhere a
personal name - one of the persons below to be "kissed" -, but not the name
of the play:
?Was will man denn Vergn?glicheres wissen!
Sakontala, Nala, die mu? man k?ssen?
(Goethe, *Zahme Xenien*)
Could it, therefore, enhance the faithfulness of your  memorable
translation by using "he ?akuntale" instead of "he ??kuntala" (exigencies
of meter set aside for the moment)?
Kind regards,
