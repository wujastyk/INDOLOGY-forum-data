Dear list,
Just further on this discussion, I would recommend reading the recent
works of Bryan Levman - particularly his recent article: "Sak?ya
niruttiy? Revisited" in the BEI. A scanned copy is available here:

A fairly recent bibliography of Dr Levman's works is available here:

Links to many of his articles is available here:

Kind regards,
