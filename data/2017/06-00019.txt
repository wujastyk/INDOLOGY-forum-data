[INDOLOGY] Epigraphia Indica Vol. 39
Dear colleagues,
I remember some time ago there was a request about an online digital copy of Epigraphia Indica Vol. 39. I'm not sure this was addressed. I am specifically interested in D.C. Sircar's 'Siyan stone slab inscription of Nayapala', which is in pt. 2 of vol. 39.
Can anyone suggest where to get a copy of the volume, or share one?
With many thanks
