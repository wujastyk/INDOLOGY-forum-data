Subject: [INDOLOGY] Looking for PDF scans of two books...
Message-ID: <CAB_JScWrVGL2UDBHmgPzkC2GToBBetswn1-rnH+t28eOEqgOhA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Colleagues,

I am looking for a PDF scan of two books:

1. Jagannatha Panditaraja by V.A. Ramaswami Sastri, published as Annamalai
Series No.8, 1942.

and

2. S M PAranjape's edition of the Bhaminivilasa, published by PM Sathaye
and Co, Pune, 1897.


Would be grateful if anyone could help me source these PDFs.


Kind regards,

Santosh Gokhale

Bonn, Germany
