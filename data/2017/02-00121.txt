[INDOLOGY] Looking for PDF scans of two books...
Dear Colleagues,
I am looking for a PDF scan of two books:
1. Jagannatha Panditaraja by V.A. Ramaswami Sastri, published as Annamalai
Series No.8, 1942.
and
2. S M PAranjape's edition of the Bhaminivilasa, published by PM Sathaye
and Co, Pune, 1897.
Would be grateful if anyone could help me source these PDFs.
Kind regards,
Santosh Gokhale
