   - sa??odhitam edited

sa??odhitam has the sense of 1. textual criticism done, 2. copy improved,
3. 'mistakes' removed (e.g. if it is a stotra, reader is being assured of
no 'mistakes') 4. Approved by authorities in the subject etc.  also apart
from 'edited' (Editing may include these. But I want to provide the
conventional senses in which this word on the cover is taken)

Student may be informed that sense varies and depends on the context.
