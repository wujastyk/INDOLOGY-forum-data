[INDOLOGY] Andhra toponymy
"Tk" may be for "Taluk," though your online resource says it's a Tehsil.
The names of agraharams that I'm aware of in the Thanjavur district are not
abbreviated in the way you describe.  Rather, they seem to be named always
in full, even if long.
Thank you for villageinfo.in ! Wonderful resource.
Best,
Dominik
