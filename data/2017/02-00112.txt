Artur,
I thought I had posted the suggestion you contact the chancery of the Archbishop-Patriarch of Goa, but I don't see my message so perhaps it got lost. Anyway, the archdiocese has a website <?http://www.archgoadaman.org/?> and a directory of offices so one can pick which to approach first <?http://www.archgoadaman.org/content/diocesan-bodies?>.
Good luck,
Allen

 Dear Colleagues,
Is it possible that no one on the List has access to Konkani descriptions of the Goan Basilica do Bom Jesus?
With sad regards,?

Dear List,?
I am involved in the preparation of the supplement to the?Official List of Polish Geographical Names of the World?-?already published in 2005, by the Head Office of Geodesy and Cartography (G??wny Urz?d Geodezji i Kartografii), Warsaw, Poland -??and?accessible at:?

?The supplement ?- planned to be published as the?Official List of Polish Names of Historical Monuments and Buildings of the World?- is??to include?formal names of selected important South Asian historical buildings/monuments; a provisional, not yet completed list, is accessible at:
https://www.academia.edu/23167 699/Nazwy_budowli_-_Azja_Po%C5 %82udniowa_Names_of_buildings_ and_other_architectural_monume nts_in_South_Asia_

Usually, I do not have problems in locating the formal, official names of geographical objects in India.?

The?Bas?lica do Bom Jesus, however,??eludes me. What I come across is?Borea Jezuchi Bajilika,?as at:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Basilica_of_Bom_Jesus

Since the presumably Konkani name is already a transliteration, it cannot ?serve as the basis for precise transliteration and the Polish transcription.?
What I need are VERY FORMAL names of the Basilica - both in?Hindi?and?Konkani?- such as those formally used and published in the Indian Catholic Church sources.?

If you would give me the names?as they are written in Devanagari, I could easily transliterate them - using myself the ISO 15919 rules of Romanization.?

Thank you in advance for your kind help,?
