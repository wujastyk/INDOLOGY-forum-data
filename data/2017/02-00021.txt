Dear Colleagues,
We are pleased to announce that we have just updated our material on the 
Oxford Research Archive relating to the development and spread of the 
R?ma narrative (pre-modern) ? first deposited in January last year ? so 
that it can be available for others to consult even in its present, 
unfinished state.It can be accessed at the same location 
<<http://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:8df9647a-8002-45ff-b37e-7effb669768b>http://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:8df9647a-8002-45ff-b37e-7effb669768b> 
or you can find it via the Bodleian Libraries website, under ORA, by 
looking for its title, "Development and spread of the R?ma narrative 
(pre-modern)".
Because of the nature of our own contacts this message is being sent 
primarily to other Indologists but, if any of you are aware of 
colleagues in other fields (for example Southeast Asian languages or 
visual culture) who might be interested, do please pass the information 
on to them ? and similarly, if anyone has access to academic lists on 
which it could be posted, we would be grateful for its being sent to them.
With all good wishes
John and Mary
