Ballaleshwar (Ganapati), one of the Ashta Vinayak, is located at Pali,
Raigadh , 121 km from Pune ,93.6 km from Mumbai.
Nashik to Pali Ganapati , Ballaleshwar is 104 km.
Though Nashik to Kolhapur is 450 km, to have Kolhapur Mahalakshmi as
Kuladevata (=family deity) , usually distance does not count.
