[INDOLOGY] Ismail Jogi mantra
O? namo k?mr? des k?m?khy? dev?
Tah?? base ism?il jog?
Ism?il jogi ke t?n be??
Ek to?e ek picho?e
Ek ??t tij?r? go?e
Let us try the outward meaning:
Om Namo (Well known beginning of such rituals, spells etc. ) (Om, the
Vedic syllable, namah, literally, bowing =obedience) , expression of
worshiping attitude
k?mr? des k?m?khy? dev?
(Let me remember, focus on , concentrate on ) k?m?m?khy?d?v? of k?mr?p region
Note: In the magecian's /spell-healer's patter/formulaic recitation,
mention of the Devi forms , particularly of nearby region is a
convention.
In south India, such rural rustic practitioners usually mention
k?m?k?? of k??c?, m?n?k?? of madurai, vi??l?k?? of k??? (v?ra????) as
a beginning of their ritual /spell event. They may add a few more
Devis.
Tah?? base ism?il jog?
= Ismail Jogi who lives (base) there (t?h?m)
Ism?il jogi ke t?n be??
There are three sons to Ismail Jogi
Ek to?e ek picho?e
Ek ??t tij?r? go?e
This part of the riddle, I give up. Ek =one ??t = cool , cold
