Subject: [INDOLOGY] Fwd: Pippalagrama of the Nikumbha king?

Thanks also to Nagaraj Paturi and Michael Witzel. Additional information 
like the personal name Tuka and the reference to a Nikumbha king may 
indeed help to eliminate at least some of the many possible 
Pippalagr?mas. The general spread of T?jika astrology (starting from 
Gujarat) may give a clue as well. I have not so far seen any reference 
to authors from Orissa or Kashmir, though there are a few (later) works 
from Bengal.
