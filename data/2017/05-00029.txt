Subject: [INDOLOGY] Seeking scan of GRV pages
Message-ID: <B75C43AA-D2EC-43C2-B956-3F66FFC7F95E@tending.to>

Gentlefolk,

I need to consult a few pages of the Gop?lar?java???val? published by the Nepal Research Centre in 1985, edited by Dhanavajra Vajracarya. My own copy was mislaid by customs officials some years ago, and the nearest copy is a day's travel away. Would any kind soul be able to forward me scans of the facsimiles and transcriptions of ff 15-24 ?

Many thanks.

?WBTD.
