Has anyone wrestled with the divergent meanings of "ka??ya"?  Obviously
there are core meanings like "red/yellow," "a sort of tea-like infusion,"
and "astringent taste."  But there are several outlier meanings, including
Wilson's "attachment to worldly objects."  Wilson is often very apt, and I
think he got his meaning from the Pandits around him.   The Buddhist
"decay, etc." seems to carry over the ChUp's "impurity, sin."
 Ved?ntas?ra's "stupidity" is another outlier.  Is this really a conflation
of homonyms, or what?
