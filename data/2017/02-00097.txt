[INDOLOGY] Kept women?
Dear Martin,
this sounds like a variant expression for avaruddh? (str?) / avaruddhastr?.
The latter is explained in Olivelle's Dictionary (2015) as a "mistress or
concubine in the exclusive keeping of one individual until his death".
Avaruddh? is an old and quite common term for women kept in a harem
(avarodha), testified as orodh? also in P?li texts. Closest to your
"dh?tastr?" seems to come "dh?t?" ("a concubine"). Evidence to be found in
Jaina texts: B. J. Sandesara, Lexicographical Studies in ?Jaina
Sanskrit?. *Journal
of the Oriental Institute Baroda* 9.4 (1960): 60.
A cheerful read: David Smith, ?One man and many women: some notes on the
harem in mainly ancient and medieval India from sundry perspectives.?
In: *Cracow
Indological Studies* 14 (2012), S. 1-16.
Best wishes,
Walter
