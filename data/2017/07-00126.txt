Hi Brendan, 

The form suggests dharani rolls, but they are all labeled JA ?? on the end. This is the Tibetan word for "tea" but,
unless these are cylindrical tea bricks (?!), it must have some other significance here. It stands for 7
when the alphabet it used for numerical ordering, but I can't see any sense to that here.

Probably the rolls have to be opened to find out. This of course should only be done
by a qualified antiquities specialist.

good luck,
Matthew

Dear colleagues,

I just came into possession of 11 cylindrical objects, 1 about 9 cm long
and 1.5 cm in diameter, the other 10 about 5 cm long and 1.25 cm in
diameter. I do not know what they are. Perhaps, someone knowlegeable
can suggest to me how I can find out what they are.

The person who gave these items to me reports that they were
discovered when a statue of the Buddha broke. The statue was part of a
collection held somewhere in the state of Michigan.

Cordially yours,
Brendan Gillon
