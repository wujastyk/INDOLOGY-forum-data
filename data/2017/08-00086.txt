Dear Dominik,

You wrote: >The OLH [=  Open Library of the Humanities <https://www.openlibhums.org/>] ? has a robust business model.< 

How did it come to develop this model and how can it maintain (or continue to maintain) the model? The services it provides must cost something. Who pays for them?

Thanks for the guidance you are providing to Indologists.
