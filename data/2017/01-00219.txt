[INDOLOGY] Discussing Academia.edu
I concur with Dominik on the valuable features of academia.edu. I would add
that I find the sins of academia.edu quite minor compared to those of the
large for-profit companies that own scholarly journals. We all publish in
journals owned by Springer, John Wiley & Sons, and other commercial
scholarly publishers that make significant profit margins off of our
research, usually after taking the copyright and putting our work behind
paywalls.
If one wants to protest the commercialization of academic work and such, it
seems that journals are the place to start.
