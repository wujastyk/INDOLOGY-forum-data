Thanks again, Walter, for confirming that there is no explicit 
discussion of astrology as an (in)accurate reflection of karma in the 
MU. Astrological texts repeatedly assert that the function of astrology 
is precisely to make the workings of karma visible, e.g. 
/V?ddhayavanaj?taka /1.3:

/y? p?rvakarmaprabhavasya dh?tr? dh?tr? lal??e likhit? pra?asti? |//
//t?? ??stram etat praka?a? vidhatte d?po yath? vastu ghane ?ndhak?re ||//
/
'This science reveals the edict carrying the impact of previous action, 
which was inscribed on one's forehead by the Creator, even as a lamp 
[reveals] an object in utter darkness.'

Yes, I did get that point, which is why I specified 'In the case of a 
person who is not willing to make any great effort'.

Best wishes,
Martin
