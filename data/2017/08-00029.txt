[INDOLOGY] Ancient Indian archaeologists / treasure hunters
Dear List-ists
Are you aware of any mentions of digs for hidden treasures - in ancient
Indian literature (Sanskrit, Pali, Prakrits)? One of such explorations is
described in Buddhaghosa's Sumangalavilasini, another one - in the
Mahabharata (I, 017-030).
