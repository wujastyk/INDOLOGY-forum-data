[INDOLOGY] purna avadana
Dear Rupali,
This was translated into English by Joel Tatelman as *The Glorious Deeds of
P?r?a: A Translation and Study of the P?r??vad?na*. It was published in
2000 by Curzon, and reprinted by Motilal Banarsidass in 2001. It is still
in print and available.
Best regards,
David Reigle
