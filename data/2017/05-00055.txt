[INDOLOGY] Ismail Jogi mantra
Five years ago I sent to the List this question:
<< Mantras in popular Indian magic books - of indrajala type - invoke often
two mysterious personages: Ismail Jogi and Nuna/Nona/Luna/Lona Chamarin.
Has anyone written a paper on them. A monograph - perhaps?>>
?There was no answer.
One such mantra runs as follows:
*O? namo k?mr? des k?m?khy? dev?*
*Tah?? base ism?il jog?*
*Ism?il jogi ke t?n be??*
*Ek to?e ek picho?e*
*Ek ??t tij?r? go?e*
I am not sure about the meaning of this mantra.
Ismail Jogi (contradictio in adiecto) had three sons:
one aborted (?), one retarded (?)
one coolly (?) in your (?) womb.
I would be grateful for your comments,
