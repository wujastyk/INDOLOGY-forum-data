[INDOLOGY] Book Announcement
Dear friends and colleagues (and apologies for cross-posting),
I thought that members of the list may be interested in learning that my
book, *Rethinking the Buddha: Early Buddhist Philosophy as Meditative
Perception *(Cambridge, 2014) has recently been issued  in paperback. This
is a short description of its contents -
A cornerstone of Buddhist philosophy, the doctrine of the four noble truths
maintains that life is replete with suffering, desire is the cause of
suffering, nirvana is the end of suffering, and the way to nirvana is the
eightfold noble path. Although the attribution of this seminal doctrine to
the historical Buddha is ubiquitous, Rethinking the Buddha demonstrates
through a careful examination of early Buddhist texts that he did not
envision them in this way. Shulman traces the development of what we now
call the four noble truths, which in fact originated as observations to be
cultivated during deep meditation. The early texts reveal that other
central Buddhist doctrines, such as dependent-origination and selflessness,
similarly derived from meditative observations. This book challenges the
conventional view that the Buddha's teachings represent universal themes of
human existence, allowing for a fresh, compelling explanation of the
Buddhist theory of liberation.
With best regards,
