A minor addition: in the 1990s, while I was reading Prakrit texts with AM Ghatage in the office of the Prakrit Dictionary Project (Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Pune), I noticed that some of the rare Prakrit text editions being used for the dictionary research had previously belonged to Esther Solomon (there were inscriptions in the front of some items). So at least some volumes from her library made its way into that collection.

Only after I visited and met her did I learn that she was an Indian Jew. She was so hospitable and kind to a young unknown scholar from the US. If not for the name, I would never have suspected that she was a Jew ? wore a Gujarati saree and very much a Gujarati lady culturally. With best wishes,
