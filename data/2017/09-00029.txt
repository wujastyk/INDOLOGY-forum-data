Dear Palaniappan,
the date (which can be estimated only relatively) and place of Dak?i??vartan?tha are indeed still open to discussion. I take the opportunity of your remark for reviewing my notes on the question.
The dating to the 12th century given by Pollock (World Philology, p. 118 - https://books.google.be/books?hl=fr&id=lbMyBQAAQBAJ&dq=Dak?i??vartan?tha&q=Daksinavartanatha#v=onepage&q=Dak?i??vartan?tha&f=false )
is not really supported (there is a reference, ibid. fn. 18 p. 353, to Unni 1987 [see below], but the latter pp. 40-41 proposes a dating from the 13th to the 15th c.). 
The place Tiruvala?cu?i [Thiruvalanjuli, also near Kumbakonam] given by Ajay K. Rao 2014 (your reference) was suggested by T. Ga?apati ??str? in his preface to the 1919 Trivandrum Sanskrit Series (no. 64) edition of the Meghasa?de?a with Dak?i??vartan?tha's Prad?pa (following the name of ?iva called Dak?i??vartan?tha in the sanctuary there, see: http://www.archive.org/details/MeghadutaWithTheCommentaryOfDaksinavartanatha ). 
Unithiri 1976 (see below) suggests another Tiruvala?cu?i? in Kerala (Thrissur District), with the idea that D would be the Sanskritised form of a Malayalam place-name [Tiru +] "vala?cuzhi (dak?i?a = valam, 'right' + ?varta = cuzhi, 'whirlpool')". (Unni 1987, pp. 34-38, in discussing these suggestions even adds a third, Keralan also, Tiruvala?cu?i place, but he does not accept the Keralan ones and keeps the idea of the name Dak?i??vartan?tha as referring to the peculiar name of ?iva in the Tamil tradition linked to Tiruvala?cu?i near Kumbakonam). As we have seen, D gives the Sanskrit name of his place of origin (which could correspond to Tiruvi?aimarutt?r" [Thiruvidaimaruthur] near Kumbakonam, and thus close to the shrine of his name-deity according to N. P. Unni), for which you make now another suggestion of interpretation (Tiruppu?aimarut?r [Thiruppudaimaruthur], Ambasamudram taluk in Thirunelveli Distr. - http://tnmurals.org/Tiruppudaimaruduur.html : mural paintings in the temple).
As for the relative dating, according to T. Ga?apati ??str? the date of D must be between the 12th c. (since D quotes the lexicon of Ke?avasv?min [ed. TSS 23, 29, 31, 1913] dated by Ga?apati ??str? to the 12th c. - but this lexicon belongs probably rather to the 2nd part of the 13th c. according to Madhukar M. Patkar, History of Sanskrit Lexicography, 1981, p. 97) and Aru?agirin?tha's time  (contemporary of  Mallin?tha, early 15th century).
Examining the peculiar relationships between Dak?i??vartan?tha's Prad?pa and P?r?asarasvat?'s Vidyullat?, S.K. De (intr. to his critical ed. of the poem, 1957, p. xxxi fn. 92 ; cf. also 1957 below, pp. 51-52) presumes that D is prior to P. This is also the opinion of Unni with a few more arguments (1987, pp. 52-53, cf. 2016 below). But Unithiri, who has made a closer comparison between the two (1976: "It is to be noticed that in almost all cases [when D differs from P in readings] D[a]k[?i??vartan?tha] notes the variant readings which are those  of P[?r?a]s[arasvat?] and in most cases those of P[a]r[ame?va] also, indicating thereby that Dk corrects the traditionally accepted readings for his own reasons" ? about 20 such occurrences) has suggested the reverse (1975, p. viii; cf. also Iyer 1965, stressing on the differences between the Kerala textual tradition of P?r?asarasvat?/Parame?vara, on the one hand, and the one of Dak?i??vartan?tha/Mallin?tha on the other).
Having myself several reasons to place P in the first part of the 14th c. (he must be close to Payy?r Bha??a Parame?vara 'I', fl. c. 1330, whose Sumanorama?? criticizes the Vidyullat? in a manner letting think that the two authors were very near in time and place), it would mean that D would belong either to to middle/second part of the 14th c. (close to both Mallin?tha and Aru?agirin?tha ? there is some connexion between them by their respective choices of names: A and M inspired by/having studied with D?) if he comes after, or to 2nd part of the 13th c. if he come before. I am at the moment of my examination rather inclined to place D after P.

P.S. 
1. the wrong statement made by T. Ga?apati ??str? (1919) that Mallin?tha quotes "Aru??chalan?tha" (= Aru?agirin?tha) ? the n?tha to whom both Mallin?tha and Aru?agirin?tha refer being samely Dak?i??vartan?tha only ? is slavishly repeated by De 1957, p. 51, and should be ignored.
2. Here is the available portion of  the text of Dak?i??vartan?tha's D?pik? on Raghuva??a 6.59  as quoted by Unni 1984, p. 10, 1987, p. 37 (2016, p. 44): p???yade?e k?yaku??ti k?pi nad? vidyate | 
3. Editions of Dak?i??vartan?tha's D?pik?s on both the Raghuva??a and the Kum?rasambhava is something reallly needed: Unni is himself relying on, respectively, the KUML transcripts T.220 and T.216 (the first one was lost when I once tried to consult it).
Best wishes,
Christophe
