[INDOLOGY] Vopadeva's Place of Origin
Dear Colleagues,??? If it can be of any help, I may refer you to the article about Vopadeva written by Prof. Nalini Balbir (Paris), in Lexicon Grammaticorum, Second edition, general editor Harro Stammerjohann, T?bingen, Niemeyer, 2009, p. 1594. She writes: V. (2nd half of the 13th century) belonged to a family of physicians who were in the service of the Y?dava kings in Maharashtra. 
In general, I can recommend this dictionary of past linguists and grammarians of all areas of the world. Maybe it is now also available on line.
Best regards, and best wishes for the New Year.??? Georges-Jean Pinault (Paris)

Dear Professor Aklujkar,
Thank you for the information. But modern Berar now comes under Bihar province. So, can we say that Vopadeva hails from the eastern part of India?
Best regards,
Niranjan?
