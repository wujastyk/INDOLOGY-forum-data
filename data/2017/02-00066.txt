[INDOLOGY] Devipurana (2)
Dear Mr. Rosati,
I have the Bengali edition of the *Dev?pur??a* you are referring to. The
verse 39.6 fully quoted runs thus (without removing the doubled consonants
used by the editor):
*sarvvak?masusiddhyartha? r?jati vedaparvvate |*
*yajed bhaum?tjamjo dev?? k?m?khye girikandare ||*
The reference to the sacred site of K?m?khy? in Assam is embedded in a
longer descriptive enumeration of various sacred sites of goddesses
contained within 39.2-39.21 ('*brahma?? pu?kare dev??.plav? hel?
prak?rtit??*') of the Bengali edition. I do not have the Devan?gar?
edition, hence I am unable to check if this rather interesting little
passage on what seem to be important ??kta* p??ha*s of the time is included
in it. If it is not, let me know and I can scan the passage from the
Bengali edition for you.
I would interpret Bhaum?tmaja as "a descendent of [king] Bhauma", in which
Bhauma, according to royal genealogical myths of K?mar?pa from the fourth
to the twelfth centuries CE, seems to refer to the alternative name of
Naraka, the mythical first king of Pr?gjyoti?a. The second half of the
verse means accordingly: "A [--by extension, 'any'--] descendent of Bhauma
[the first king of K?mar?pa] must worship the goddess in the mountain cave
K?m?khy?". For a description of the myth of the first king of K?mar?pa, the
genealogies of that kingdom and the K?mar?pa kings' loyal patronage of the
site of K?m?khya for the authorization of their political power, see
J.E.Shin, "Changing Dynasties, Enduring Genealogy: A Critical Study on the
Political Legitimation in early Mediaeval K?mar?pa". I attach the article
herewith.
I do hope this may be of some help.
