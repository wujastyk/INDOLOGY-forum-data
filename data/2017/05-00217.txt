Dear Matthew,

>> Asoka after embracing Buddhism discontinued this practice and removed
the idols of such deities.

The meanig of the sentence is clear. According to Dr. Ambedkar A?oka
'removed the idols of such deities'.

Removed - gently?

The problem is that no edict mentions A?oka stating:  "As I venerate the
Buddha, the Enlightened One, there is no need to worship any other deity".

The question of 'the emergence of images and idols in India" apart what can
be seen here is an example of falsification of historical record, done
purposefully, with political agenda in mind.
