For the second reference, see George T. Artola, "A New Pa?catantra Text" in Munshi Indological Volume (Bh?rat?ya Vidy?), 1962, p. 75-95

(I have no access on what the same scholar would already have published on the work in ALB 12, 1957, pp. 220-225)
For Bendall's reference (https://www.jstor.org/stable/25208918?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents )
I do not find it referred to in the three Hertel's works (1908, 1912, 1915) issued in the HOS:

Norman Brown (in The American Journal of philology 40, 1919, pp. 423-440
https://archive.org/details/jstor-288918 ) refers to Hertel's Das Pa?catantra (1914 - http://dspace.ut.ee/handle/10062/27852 ) and there p. 313-337  can be seen the version/recension (Tantraakhyaana) corresponding to Bendall's text (also dealt with by Hertel in ZDMG 64, 1910, p. 59 http://menadoc.bibliothek.uni-halle.de/dmg/periodical/pageview/56336 ).
The relationships of all these versions is quite a complicated matter... It is possible that the episode was translated by Richard Schmidt (see http://digital.indologica.de/?q=node/1060 )
