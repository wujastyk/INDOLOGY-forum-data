For the second reference, see George T. Artola, "A New Pa?catantra Text" in Munshi Indological Volume (Bh?rat?ya Vidy?), 1962, p. 75-95
https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.143262/2015.143262.Munshi-Indological-Felicitation-Volume#page/n81/mode/2up
(I have no access on what the same scholar would already have published on the work in ALB 12, 1957, pp. 220-225)
For Bendall's reference (https://www.jstor.org/stable/25208918?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents )
I do not find it referred to in the three Hertel's works (1908, 1912, 1915) issued in the HOS:

https://archive.org/details/panchatantratext00hert

Norman Brown (in The American Journal of philology 40, 1919, pp. 423-440
https://archive.org/details/jstor-288918 ) refers to Hertel's Das Pa?catantra (1914 - http://dspace.ut.ee/handle/10062/27852 ) and there p. 313-337  can be seen the version/recension (Tantraakhyaana) corresponding to Bendall's text (also dealt with by Hertel in ZDMG 64, 1910, p. 59 http://menadoc.bibliothek.uni-halle.de/dmg/periodical/pageview/56336 ).
The relationships of all these versions is quite a complicated matter... It is possible that the episode was translated by Richard Schmidt (see http://digital.indologica.de/?q=node/1060 )
Best wishes,

> An independent scholar asked me for some information on Cecil Bendall's work on the Tantr?khy?na (see, The Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland
> New Series, Vol. 20, No. 4 (Oct., 1888), pp. 465-501?), especially if the work had ever been translated. His particular interest is Story 28, "The Skull on the Seashore", which W. Norman Brown discusses.  He also asked if the Tantr?khy?na is related to the Tantropakhyanam. (ed. K. Sambasiva Sastri Trivandrum. 1938. Trivandrum Sanskrit Series, No. 132). I don't know the latter work, but I presume that although the titles are similar (and somewhat generic), the texts are not.
