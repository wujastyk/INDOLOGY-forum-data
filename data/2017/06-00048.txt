[INDOLOGY] Issues with Sanskrit 2003 font
Thank you Dominik for that clarification.
In that case there is a free open source font editor called fontforge which
I have used for many years.  Its available for Mac, Windows and Linux.  It
would be quite easy using this to move the position of the anusvara dot.
The link is: https://fontforge.github.io/en-US/
