Even if it does document the history and prevalence of violence in India?s
past, is it not already done in almost every book on ancient Indian history?

By 1932 itself, a Marxist Telugu poet wrote the following poem (Translation
appearantly by Sri Kambhampati Subba Rao):

Desa Charitralu  (Histories of the Nations)

                  -Sree Sree (Srirangam Srinivasarao)
                 Maha Prasthanam

-*-Translation from Telugu-*-
