Dear Colleagues,

we invite applications for admission to our newly established four week 
intensive course

*"Lived Sanskrit Cultures in Varanasi" *

that will take place in Varanasi from *19th Feb. to 16th Mar. 2018.*

The course will be carried out in cooperation with Prof. Gopabandhu 
Mishra (BHU). Three broad areas will be covered, these include "Teaching 
Sanskrit and the Veda", "Performing Rituals", and "K???y?tr?: 
Processions in Varanasi".  An essential part of the course would be to 
include gender perspectives in the study of all the three mentioned areas.

We would be grateful if you could widely circulate this call for 
applications. For further information please consult the following page:
