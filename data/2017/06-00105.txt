Dear Colleagues,
we invite applications for admission to our newly established four week 
intensive course
*"Lived Sanskrit Cultures in Varanasi" *
that will take place in Varanasi from *19th Feb. to 16th Mar. 2018.*
The course will be carried out in cooperation with Prof. Gopabandhu 
Mishra (BHU). Three broad areas will be covered, these include "Teaching 
Sanskrit and the Veda", "Performing Rituals", and "K???y?tr?: 
Processions in Varanasi".  An essential part of the course would be to 
include gender perspectives in the study of all the three mentioned areas.
