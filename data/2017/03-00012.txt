Several versions of the legend exist in New Persian also, named
"Belawhar va B?d?saf" or "Blawhar wa B?zasf", see e.g. the entry in the
Encyclopaedia Iranica (which does not include later versions in New
Persian, however)

Maybe the entry by D. M. Lang in the Encyclopaedia of Islam could also
be helpful:

Lang, D.M., ?Bilawhar Wa-Y?d?saf?, in: Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second
Edition, Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van
Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs.

The Blawhar wa B?zasf by ?Al? Ibn Mu?ammad Ni??m Tabr?z? (14th century)
was printed by Mirath-i Maktub, Tehran 2002.
