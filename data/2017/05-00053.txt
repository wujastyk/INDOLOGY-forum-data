I found on DLI the second volume of his Smr?titattva (edited by J?v?nanda Vidy?s?gara) (Kalik?t?: Siddhe?vara Press, 1865). Does anybody know whether the first volume (which includes, amongst the others, Tithitattva) is available in a digital format as well? If so, I?d be very thankful if you could point me in the right direction or, even better, if you had one copy to share.
