[INDOLOGY] A new Sanskrit Reader
Dear Antonia,
Inevitably, we all will recommend you add texts belonging to our field of
research.... I personally would like to see some excerpts from medical and
alchemical literature included. And, as a crowd pleaser, perhaps some ha?ha
yoga texts?
Very best,
Dagmar
