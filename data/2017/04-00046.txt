[INDOLOGY] Help with Ramayana
Dear Howard,
I don't see immediately how this reference in the Ramayana could be understood as 'primordial writing.' What should primordial mean? If the passage refers to the name of Rama represented by some sort of script on a ring, still to what extent could it be a reliable source about the introduction of the technology of writing in South Asia? How would it help us in this matter?
I'm curious to know more about the line of argument of the Hindu scholar you are corresponding with.
Best wishes,
