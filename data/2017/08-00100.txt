Subject: [INDOLOGY] Starting a new academic journal

Well, it's not exactly that "these journals are openly available on the internet" if you understand "openly" as an Open Access. Your institution has to have a subscription to a particular JSTOR collection to access a specific journal (e.g. JAOS articles are free for download at JSTOR only for the years 1843?1922). 

And JSTOR's main goal (similarly as in the case of all other paid platforms) is to maximize their profit, so they distribute journals of one subject area into several (typically almost all) collections forcing academic institutions to buy all of them (at present JSTOR has fifteen Arts & Sciences collections). Since it's very expensive to buy all collections, many institutions have subscription only for the first 3?5, or for the so called JSTOR Essential which includes about one third of all titles.

So even if your institution has a subscription to JSTOR, very rarely it is a subscription to ALL collections, so many important Indological journals still remain inaccessible to most of us. So I fully support Dominik's urge for publishing in truly OA journals or in journals where the author is the copyright holder and a contract alows her/him to upload some version of the article at some OA platform (like academia.edu).

Best,
Lubomir

I will only add that the JAOS has the added virtue that it assigns copyright to authors.  Many of these journals are openly available on the internet (via JSTOR or Pers?e, etc.) with only the last 3 or 5 years protected to encourage subscription.  For JAOS, the ?look back? is only 3 years.

I am surprised, however, to see how many of the journals relevant to Indology still function on what I think of as the "old model," and are run as for-profit enterprises by commercial companies like Springer, Elsevier, Brill and others, whose first duty is not to the growth of knowledge, but to their shareholders.

The reason given by the press was (in my words) that it was willing to sacrifice intellectual integrity for the purpose of continuing to sell the broad range of its products in the Chinese market.  The press has since changed its mind<http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/08/cambridge-university-press-posts-censored-articles-170822075543589.html> as a result of widespread incredulity and outrage from the academic establishment.  It might be uncharitable to view it this way, but one can't help thinking that CUP continues make decisions based on the bottom line, and has simply decided that it stands to lose more by alienating its domestic academic market than the Chinese one.
