[INDOLOGY] Question
On another discussion group, Shri Ujjwal Rajput cited the following verse:
????????? ?????? ????????? ???????????? ??????????????? ?????????????
??? ?? *????????* ????????? ???????? ?? ?????????????? ???? ? *??? ????????*
?
This combination of "sma" with optative forms is very rare.  Are there
other examples of this usage, and any discussion available about it?
