Subject: [INDOLOGY] A new Sanskrit Reader
Message-ID: <7833594032f9651e3@wm-srv.ulb.ac.be>

And, why not, some excerpts from mathematical or astronomical literature. Mathematics in Sanskrit are not as uneasy as they are reputed. See my recent Les math?matiques de l'autel v?dique (http://www.droz.org/france/fr/6416-9782600013826.html) for the most ancient texts, but also Aryabhata's and Bhaskara's works (as edited and translated by Fran?ois Patte), as well as some mathematics from Kerala. Please contact us for more details.

Best wishes for your work,

Dr Jean Michel Delire,
Lecturer on Science and Civilization in India - Sanskrit Texts, University of Brussels
