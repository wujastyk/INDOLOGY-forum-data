[INDOLOGY] purna avadana
Dear Dr Mokashi,
If you can't find the book suggested by David Reigle, the same translation has been reprinted in the Clay Sanskrit Library series, in the volume Heavenly Exploits (Buddhist Biographies from the Divyavadana) (ISBN-13: 978-0-8147-8288-0  |  ISBN-10: 0-8147-8288-4), together with the translation of other three avadanas.
Best wishes,
Camillo
