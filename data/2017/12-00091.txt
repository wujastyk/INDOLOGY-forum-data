Dear Indologists,

I have a student who is interested in Pulavar Ku?antai's Ir?va?a-K?viyam (http://www.worldcat.org/title/iravana-kaviyam/oclc/294761601), but who cannot read Tamil.  Does anyone know of an English translation, partial or complete, of whatever quality, published or not?

Best,
Tim Lubin
