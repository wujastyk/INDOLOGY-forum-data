Thanks, Jonathan, for this bibliographic information. I was just about to
write asking for it. Unfortunately, the 1973 Japanese publication that
would apparently include the Sanskrit text does not show up on WorldCat.
Japanese publications are notoriously hard to get in the U.S.A.

Peter, when you refer to Buddha?r?j??na's commentary, the
Praj??prad?p?val?, you are apparently referring to Tohoku no. 3800. But you
seem to be saying that the Sanskrit manuscript is actually of a portion of
a different Praj??prad?p?val? commentary, one by J??nap?da? If so, does a
Tibetan translation of it exist?

Then, you are saying that it is only chapter 8. I assume that this means
the last and eighth chapter of the Abhisamay?la?k?ra, which may or may not
be the same as a possible chapter 8 of the Praj??prad?p?val? commentary.

In any case, this text is of great interest. It had remained entirely
unknown to me. If you (or anyone) has a copy of the 1973 Japanese
publication that includes this Sanskrit text, I would be very grateful to
receive it. Thanks!

Best regards,

David Reigle
