[INDOLOGY] bhagwa dvaj
It is interesting to read your words,
"With that in mind, my remit is to suspend judgement and disbelief, and
*try* to privilege the emic perspective."
Not related to the topic of the fantasies being discussed,
Do you think Indology centred around /rooted in historical critical method
and privileging emic perspectives that are neither historical nor critical
can go hand in hand?
........................................
That apart, coming to the present topic of your study of these fantasies,
Are you sure that you suspended your judgement?
.........................................
Historians of 'Hinduism', particularly of modern 'Hinduism', can very
easily note that the messianic, proselytising features of 'Hinduism',
particularly their manifestation in the 'Hindu' organizational activities
outside India started only during modern period and in response/reaction to
or imitation of Christian evangelical activities and not  as earnest or
frivolous post-colonial, counter-hegemonic assertions against the privilege
of Eurocentric perspectives. 'post-colonial, counter-hegemonic assertions
against the privilege of Eurocentric perspectives' belong to the academic
arena or the arena of idea generations or idea conflicts. These  messianic,
proselytising features of 'Hinduism' are manifest in the activist or action
arena.
Within the global wellness industry, Yoga and Ayurveda are not  in a
position to give even a weak competition to Allopathic medicine where the
roll model of the messianic, proselytising groups of 'Hinduism', their
competitor , i.e., the Christian missionary evangelism is well rooted,
widespread and strongly supported by the worldwide rich Christian
'charity'.
There are discussions on George Bush's role in such activities here

 and so on.
There have been numerous studies on how the well meaning followers of
certain contemporary internationally mainstream academic methods
unwittingly fall into the trap of Christian ideas. Some people may argue
that this is part of global Christian imperialist project.
Islam, the other religion which has been in competition with Christianity
from centuries in messianic proselytising activities did not use any
wellness industry method for its spread.
So, if at all there is any wellness industry method that is being used by
the messianic proselytising groups of Hinduism, the roll model or
comparable phenomenon is the use of Allopathic medicine by Christian
missionary evangelism.
Communists had the dream of World Communist Empire in the name of World
Communist Society. That is now shattered by the collapse of USSR and other
communist regimes.
Some ISKCON initiated young students of me used to tell me around 25 years
ago that their movement can become a or the world religion some day. The
same persons today laugh at their own young day fantasies.
Christianity and Islam were the only two mutual competitors in this aspect
in the religions sector. They are now getting newer and newer competitors
at least in dreaming for their world kingdoms. Competition from others is
the limiting factor for each of these dreamers including the 'Hindu' ones.
That is what makes their fantasies remain fantasies.
