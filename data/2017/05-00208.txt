All the dates given to origins of idol worship in India are based on
textual evidences only and have textual determinism underlying the dating
method.

If the Indian cultural strands such as the Vedic, which have early textual
records do not indicate existence of idol worship in that strand, then it
should be reasonable to suspect the source/origin of idol worship in the
Indian cultural strands outside these textually recorded ones, i.e., folk
cultural traditions outside the Vedic, Buddhist or Jain.

Though the origin dates of cultural elements of these strands is difficult
to establish with certainty, it is equally problematic to rule out a
pre-Asokan date of origin of idol worship in these traditions as to
conclusively settle a pre-Asokan date for the same.
