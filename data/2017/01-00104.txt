[INDOLOGY] hermaphrodite king as an evil omen
This raises a very interesting point, which I've thought about but not yet
in detail: the fact that these prophecies are 'dreams' is interesting, but
I think has nothing at all to do with real dreams, any more than Pharaoh's
dreams of seven thin and seven fat cows is a dream; it is a literary
device. How this device is deployed, and then what the relationship between
such deployment and manuals of dream interpretation (and as you know
apparently the best example is that of Jagaddeva, but as you also know
there are others, especially later, at least in Jain tradition). I have
been assuming--perhaps wrongly?--that such manuals actually aim at 'real'
dreams, as a tool to help one understand what one has dreamt. Thus I
haven't looked into them in this regard...
