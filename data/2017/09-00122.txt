[INDOLOGY] Once again on the origin of zero: the date of the Bakhshali manuscript (or manuscripts?)
 Dr.Christophe Vielle,
                       Origin of  ZERO is ,indeed an enriching subject to focus on. I have been curiously 
following the discussion ,too. However, how about the fact that inhabitants of MAYA civilisation in 
Central & South America used Zero as far back as 1000.B.C? Does it pre date Bakshali Manuscript ?
                                                   ALAKENDU DAS.
