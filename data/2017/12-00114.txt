[INDOLOGY] dates of Shivaram Parashuram Bhide
Dear List members,
I am looking for information (esp. his dates) of Shivaram Parashuram Bhide, who, beside Bhagvanlal Indraji, was involved in the first English translation of the Kamasutra attributed to Burton. I hope someone on this list may be able to provide me with his bio data.
With kind regards, Herman
