[INDOLOGY] Attantya Abhava
  How about having 'naam' as the literal translation  of 'Form'.? It, perhaps is identical with 
Dravya  and  Guna .
May be it will be worthwhile  recalling the sloka from the Upanishad-
                    Asti Bhati Priyam Naam Rupam Cetashhya Pancha kam.
                    Addya Trayam Brahma Rupam Jagat Rupam Ttato Dwayam.
                                        ALAKENDU DAS.
