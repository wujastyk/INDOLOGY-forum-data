Dear Matthew,
I know of at least two more Japanese translations and one Chinese
translation with a lengthy commentary.

Dear friends,
The Trisvabh?vanirde?a, attributed to Vasubandhu, has been
translated into English at least 6 times, at least twice into French,
and once each into Hindi, Spanish and Japanese. So far, however, I have
not located translations in German or other modern languages. If you
are aware of any such translations, I would be most grateful to learn of
them.
with thanks in advance,
Matthew
