[INDOLOGY] Help with Ramayana
Dear Howard,
Thanks a lot for the nice reply, actually I didn't help at all!
The reason why I asked about the line of argument is that I simply find this will to secure a 'primordial' origin and status to writing in South Asian (or shall I say Hindu?) culture very fascinating. After all, aren't we constantly reminded on all sides of the importance of direct oral transmission in South Asian culture--or to paraphrase the proverb, isn't it so that knowledge written in a book is like money in somebody else's hands, when you need it, it's not accessible?
Best wishes,
Camillo

Re: [INDOLOGY] Help with Ramayana
Thank you, Camillo. You and I agree.
I inserted ?primordial,? since this traditional, faith-based Hindu scholar argues that writing "has always been there.?  I?m sure and I have the same view on this matter, but I was trying to be gentle with him on text-critical issues, dating etc, so that he didn?t flame up on me.
Anyway, your help is much appreciated.
Best wishes,
Howard
