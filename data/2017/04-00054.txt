Dear Howard,

Thanks a lot for the nice reply, actually I didn't help at all!

The reason why I asked about the line of argument is that I simply find this will to secure a 'primordial' origin and status to writing in South Asian (or shall I say Hindu?) culture very fascinating. After all, aren't we constantly reminded on all sides of the importance of direct oral transmission in South Asian culture--or to paraphrase the proverb, isn't it so that knowledge written in a book is like money in somebody else's hands, when you need it, it's not accessible?

Best wishes,

Camillo

Thank you, Camillo. You and I agree.

I inserted ?primordial,? since this traditional, faith-based Hindu scholar argues that writing "has always been there.?  I?m sure and I have the same view on this matter, but I was trying to be gentle with him on text-critical issues, dating etc, so that he didn?t flame up on me.

Anyway, your help is much appreciated.

Best wishes,
Howard

If the passage refers to the name of Rama represented by some sort of script on a ring, still to what extent could it be a reliable source about the introduction of the technology of writing in South Asia? How would it help us in this matter?
