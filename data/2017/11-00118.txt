Dear Members,
does anyone on the list have access to a copy of Kota Rajya ka Itihas 
???? ????? ?? ?????? by Mathuralal Sharma ???????? ?????? I believe the 
book was first published in or around 1939 (Vikram Samvat 1996), and 
there is a 2008 second edition published in Jodhpur. No library I have 
access to seems to have a copy. I would be delighted if a kindly soul 
coul look it up and scan a few pages for me (or just photograph them 
with a mobile phone). What I need is Sharma's transcript of the 
inscriptions at Charchoma ??????? Temple (???????? ??????), along with 
anything he has to say about these inscriptions. The location is 
Appendix 2 of volume 1. I'm afraid I do not have a more precise reference.
Thank you,
Daniel
