[INDOLOGY] Gita 13.6
Dear HR-ji,
The two axiomatic principles of Bh G (Bh G time 'Hinduism' ) are :
n?sat? vidyat? bh?vah n?bh?v? vidyat? satah. Bh G 2-16 (Existence does not
come from non-existence and from existence non-existence does not come;
i.e.,Nothing is created from nothing. Everything is created from something
already in existence..Anything already in existence does not get destroyed)
and
(in fact as a corollary of this),
Time/creation is cyclic.
Based on these two , all the vyakta does not get destroyed at the end of a
creation /time cycle. Then what happens to the vyakta at that stage? It
withdraws into its avyakta form (because n?bh?v? vidyat? satah) . What
happens later? The new cycle of time/creation begins. What does that mean?
All that is withdrawn into avyakta comes back into vyakta form. (because
n?sat? vidyat? bh?vah)
