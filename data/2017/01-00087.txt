[INDOLOGY] Catushpitha Tantra vs Hevajra Tantra
Thanks a lot to all; I am going to have a look of these studies and I'll
try to contact dr Peter-Daniel Szanto.
Regarding the date of *Hevajra Tantra*, probbaly seventh century is too
early, but considering that the same list of *catuspitha*s was found either
in the ritualistic section (64) or in the mythological section (18) of
*Kalikapurana*, I argue the *Hevajra Tantra* should be compiled not later
than ninth-middle of ninth century, because I always supposed the
*catuspitha*s' concept was a product of Esoteric Buddhism and later
reformulated in the Assamese *shakta purana*s, particularly in the *Kalika*.
Thanks so much for the informations!
Best, Paolo
