[INDOLOGY] The Mythology of Brahma / Greg Bailey.
Is THIS not a STRANGE commercial request to make on this mailing list?
Provided the whole operation is agreed upon by all the interested parties,
can they not BUY a second hand copy?
Abe Book
(which I access from France on URL
https://www.abebooks.fr
has currently two copies available:
one for 45 EUROS
one for 155 EUROS
That seems affordable ...
