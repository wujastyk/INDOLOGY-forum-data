Dear Heiner,

I think none of the three stories of Vi?vantara in the M?lasarv?stiv?da
Vinaya ("the Vi?vantara-J?taka I--III" in Panglung 1981 "Preliminary
remarks on the udd?nas in the vinaya of the M?lasarv?stiv?din," p.229) and
the Vi?vantar?vad?na in the Gilgit manuscripts ("the Vi?vantara-J?taka IV,"
ibid.) gives a?vave?a. They do not mention ?akra's help in this part of the
story, either.

Vi? I (Tibetan, Chinese, and newly identified Skt fragments): Vi?vantara
gives both the coach and horses to a Brahmin and goes to the forest on foot.

Vi? II (Tibetan and Skt fragments): After he gave the coach to some
Brahmins, Vi?vantara rides his horse. Later, he gives the horse to another
group of Brahmins and proceeds on foot.

Vi? III (Tibetan, Chinese, and Gilgit manuscript): same as Vi? I.

Vi? IV (Gilgit manuscript): same as Vi? I.

I hope this helps you.

Kindest regards,
Fumi
