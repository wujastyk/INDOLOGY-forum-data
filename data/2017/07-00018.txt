[INDOLOGY]  query
Dear friends,
I have been thinking about the SubhASitaratnakoza, edited by Kosambi and translated by Ingalls
in the HOS. Although recognized as fundamental contributions in the field, I have not
found, with the exception of some of Ingalls own work and his  abridgement, 
any subsequent sustained discussions of the SRK in more recent scholarship, only
short references here and there (e.g. in the work of L. Sternbach).. KAvya not being my main field, I of course may have missed some relevant discussions and would be grateful for any leads you may be able to share
with me. 
with thanks in advance,
Matthew
