[INDOLOGY] Font?
Accessing the under-circle on a Mac is not straight-forward at all in just about any keyboard layout.  However, I use a version of the EasyUnicode font that Tim Lubin modified specifically for this purpose.  In this case: r + (opt + 1) + r = r?, l + (opt + 1) + r = l?
Tim may have more to say or a more recent version of the layout.

Hello Artur,
     I have Gandhari Unicode installed on my Mac.  The question is how to access these characters.

Dear Discutants,
let me repeat my earlier message:
Gandhari Unicode font has both l/L and r/R with rings (not dots!) below.
I use Windows, and have no problem with installing the font. Don't know if it works with Mac.
