[INDOLOGY] Sanskrit reader
Dear Patrick,
Thank you for this great suggestion! As I said, I'm thinking of pairing up
the book with a website on which to put the texts I can't include if I aim
at having a Reader less voluminous than the Petersburg Dictionary:-).
Still, at least some short-ish excerpts from modern Sanskrit texts might be
just the thing to include at the end of the physical reader.
Thanks again,
   and all the best,
        Antonia
