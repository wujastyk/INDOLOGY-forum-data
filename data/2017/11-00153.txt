Dear colleagues,

I thank Prof. Jonathan Silk for sending me a PDF file of the 72 paged
edition of the Sam?dhir?ja-s?tra. On receiving the file, I realised that I
myself possess a paper copy of it. It is a totally incomplete edition.

Sanskrit manuscripts from Nepal consist generally of more than two hundreds
folios, and the Gilgit manuscript, the Chinese translations (No 639
consists of 10 scrolls) and a Tibetan one (Pk. No. 0795, mdo sna tshogs,
thu 1b1-185a8 ) are all "voluminous".

I wonder whether there is any project of making a new edition of this very
old and important Mah?y?na scripture --- I mean a critical edition of the
whole text but not of one or two chapters done by such as Regamey and
Skilton.

Also, in this connection, I announce that our institute (IRIAB) is going to
publish a colour-facsimile edition of the Gilgit manuscript of this text,
ed. by N. Kudo et al., in the near future.

With best regards,

Seishi Karashima
