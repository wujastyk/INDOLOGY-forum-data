Dear Jacob and Dominik,

There is a better source than Ifrah, it is Genevi?ve Guitel, Histoire 
compar?e des num?rations ?crites, Flammarion, Paris, 1975. On p.623, she 
presents, refering to Filliozat, exactly the same table as below with 
the title Ecriture des nombres de 1 ? 32 dans la num?ration de la 
roupie. Then, until p.628, she explains it and compare to other 
numeration systems. May I ask you a copy of the original document Jacob 
has apparently joined ? I am also interested by the gyan bazi.

Jean Michel Delire,
Lecturer on Science and Civilization of India - Sanskrit Texts
and on History of Mathematics at the University of Brussels
