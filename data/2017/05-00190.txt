Dear Ravi,
	Something has arisen causing me to delay sending my replies to your latest questions: I have to referee two papers for a Japanese journal.   Consequently, I won?t be able to send you the replies until Friday.  In the meantime, let me thank you so much for your kind verse!  
	Yours, George Cardona
