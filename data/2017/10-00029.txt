>> A quick look in the index of Ludo Rocher's fine history of puranic literature shows an Au?anasapur??a, which is probably what Singh is trying to refer to.  P. 138 gives more information about this "lost" pur??a, which is sometimes conflated with the Vindhyam?h?tmya, that Singh also cites.  That's probably the basis of the information that Singh is garbling.
