his 1st ed., 1819), defined simply as "liberation." From there it was
copied in the Petersburg W?rterbuch (defined as Erl?sung) and in the
Monier-Williams dictionary (defined as liberation, deliverance), both of
which give only Wilson as their source for this term. It is not in the
*?abda-kalpa-druma*, but is in the *V?caspatyam*, defined as: nirv??am nirv?tir
mastakam iva yatra. Various searches by me have so far failed to turn up
this term in a Sanskrit text. Hoping that one of you has seen it in use and
can give a textual source for it.
