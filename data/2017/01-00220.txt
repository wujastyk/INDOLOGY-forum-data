Dear Sarah and dear all,

many thanks for that. To be honest, *both Cathy and I sent to Mr. Russell
Adams rectified versions of the TOC in December*, specifying that we were
the authors of the Introduction and that the three of us were the editors
of the whole issue. Thus, if something went wrong, as you imply, this
happened on your side. It is not the case that "there was no way for [you]
to possibly know that there were three guest editors".

I do not want to complain, just to help you at Equinox organising your work
better in the future.

Best wishes,

elisa freschi
