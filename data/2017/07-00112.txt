Dear friends,
I am trying to locate a copy of:
Pata?jali's Vy?kara?a-Mah?bh??ya, ?hnikas 1-3 with English translation and
notes, edited by K. V. Abhyankar and Jayadev Mohanlal Shukla, Bhankarkar
Oriental Research Institute, Poona, 1975.
If anyone is aware of a recent re-print or where to locate the original
1975 edition I would be most grateful.
With kindest wishes,
Martin Gluckman
