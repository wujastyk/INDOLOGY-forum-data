Subject: [INDOLOGY]  on Buddha's qoute
Message-ID: <20171009090455.10108.qmail@f4mail-235-139.rediffmail.com>



   To All,

          Presently I am going through a discourse on Buddhist philosophy based on the writings of Sri HaraPrasad Shastri,a mid-late 19th century Bengali scholar . On the Chaptert on 'NIRAVANA' i came across a qoute from Buddha himself,which has  been found in a certain Pali text(name not mentioned) .Buddha's qoute -roughly translates as follows - 



  Question- What is that which remains  after Nirvana?



  Buddha-    Nothing.



  Question- What is that which DOES NOT remain after Nirvana?

 

  Buddha-    Nothing.



  Question- Is there any state existing in BETWEEN the above two.?



  Buddha-  Nothing.



  Question-Is there any state existing APART from the above ?



  Buddha- Nothing.



                 Can anybody kindly  refer to the Pali text where this qoute occurs? I am interested because this qoute of Buddha has a unique identity with Shankara's Adwaitya Philisophy. Can it be in some text by Nagarjuna...or Asanga ?





                                                ALAKENDU DAS.
