[INDOLOGY] Help locating two Sanskrit scholars (c. 1750)
Dear List,
I am trying to better locate two Sanskrit scholars from approximately 1750.
My source gives their locations only by region rather than city. It simply
gives:
   - Hal?yudha Brahmac?rin (Dravida)
   - Bh?skara Pa??ita (Maharashtra)
Might anyone know more about either of these two scholars? I?ve looked in a
number of places, including the NCC, but have not found any information.
I would like to connect them to a specific city rather than simply a
region.
Many thanks,
Sam
Rajgir, Bihar
