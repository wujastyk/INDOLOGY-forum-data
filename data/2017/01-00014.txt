[INDOLOGY] Rajasthani demon
Dear all,
A colleague who is not on the list has come across an image of a demon that
looks somewhat like these. http://www.thehindu.com/
todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/to-ward-off-evil/article2812933.ece
 and http://www.bigstockphoto.com/image-107226836/stock-
photo-horror-demons-faces-of-hinduism-on-carnival-crowd-of-
the-popular-desert-festival-in-rajasthan. It also looks like this image of
Raktabija http://www.exoticindiaart.com/product/paintings/durga-and-kali-
annihilate-raktabija-HD62/
Across the image is some writing that appears to be in Rajasthani. Would
anyone fluent in that particular language be willing to look over four
lines of text and tell her what they say?
I've been asked not to widely distribute the image at this time as it is
part of a private collection but can send it to an individual.
Thanks!
Patricia
