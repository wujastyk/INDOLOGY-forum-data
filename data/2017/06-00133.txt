[INDOLOGY] Sanskrit reader
Dear Antonia Ruppel
In 2013 I have made a list of good books to learn Sanskrit, I am attaching
here the list of the same. from that books you can add extracts.
(I have 2 notes while reading the above list
1.Please bear my English Grammar mistakes.
2. Some of the books I was not able to procure at that time like Appa
Shatry Rashiwadekar's book etc, which I could collect few of them later and
I can say Appa Shastry writings are excellent and stand top among all)
I have few suggestions
Add sentences like this
?? ??? ?????????????? ???????? '?????? ???' ???????????????????????????????
????????????????????????? '?????????????? ????????' ???????
????????????????????????????????? ?????? ??????????? ?????????
???????????????????????????????????????????????????????
????????????????????????????????????? ????????????????????????? ???????...
???????????????????? ????????????????????????????????????
?????????????????????????????????? ???????????????????? ..???????... ???
??????????????? ???????.... ??????????
The above extract is taken from Raghuvamsa Commentary by Mallinatha.
And from Kavya Prakasa, there is a sentence from the first chapter, which
begins with
??????????????? ???....and ends with ?????? ???????
in the above sentence even the editor has committed mistake in some
editions, because not knowing where to put the full stop for the sentence.
The spirit of such sentences can be understood easily, but difficult to
analyze or split the compounds etc.
Modern Author's writings suggestion
1. Narayana Shatry Khiste (Daridranam Hrdayam, Vidvat Charita Panchakam etc)
2. Ganapaty Shastry T editor of Bhasanataka chakra( his preface and
Pathavali reader which is available on archives.org,   and
Bharatanuvarnanam)
3. Appa Shastry Rashiwadekar (Lavanyamayi, preface of Buddha charita etc
available on DLI)
4. Charudeva Shastry ( Gandhi Charita which contains aorist in almost all
sentences. Vakyamuktavali has special sentences. Prastava Tarangini which
has verbs with Upasarga which is the most difficult thing in Sanskrit Like
?????????=occupies, ????????????=aggrees etc.)
5. Prefaces of old Sanskrit books ( Vindhyeshwar Prasad Dwivedi, Appa
Shastry Rashiwadekar, Charudeva Shastry, Ganapati Shatry T, Venimadhava
Shukla, Rajanarayana Shukla, )
6. Writings from Sanskrit Journals like Sahrdaya, Chandrika etc
Information of all the above books are easily available on Worldcat or DLI.
One can research more books by the author and can find out which is
suitable for the reader.
I hope my suggestion is relevant
Thanks
Krishna Prasad
