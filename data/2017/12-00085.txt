To All,

             This quote is ascribed to Ramanuja while commenting  on Shankaracharya-----" MayavadaSatSastram



                                    Prachhana BuddhamEtavat".

This is the quote where Ramanuja referst to Shankarachary as a Latent Buddha.Can anybody refer to the text where Ramanuja made this comment.?
