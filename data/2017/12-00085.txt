[INDOLOGY] Ramanuja's  quote.
To All,
             This quote is ascribed to Ramanuja while commenting  on Shankaracharya-----" MayavadaSatSastram
                                    Prachhana BuddhamEtavat".
This is the quote where Ramanuja referst to Shankarachary as a Latent Buddha.Can anybody refer to the text where Ramanuja made this comment.?
           :          Alakendu Das.
