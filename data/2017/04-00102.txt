Sorry Jeff, but it's not quick and easy. The interpretation of the trisvabh?va
is far from settled and indeed was not quite settled even within the tradition.
Though your suggestion about the possible relationship with the three k?ya-s
is of interest, I do not think that it can be supported simpliciter by the extant
sources. A recent discussion, by Mario D'Amato, that does consider the soteriological dimensions
of the three natures doctrine, and references much of the previous scholarship is:
