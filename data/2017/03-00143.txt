Dear Peter,
I am extremely sorry to read this.
This is a great loss to Indology and to Sanskrit and Ayurvedic Studies, as
is clear from the link you have provided.
It was a privilege to work with him on several occasions and in the context
of eJIM.
We especially remember his participation in the seminar ?yurveda in
post-classical and pre-colonial India
organized at IIAS, Leiden, in 2009, where he presented his work on the
Hikmatprakasa, work in Sanskrit on Yunani medicine (see publication list).
Condolences to his family.
