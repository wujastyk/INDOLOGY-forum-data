Subject: [INDOLOGY] Temporary glitch
Message-ID: <CAKdt-CcXmuMG_ZyqxJcf99Kx0VxQUmVCKXAZ+3r9Ad5pXP5-CA@mail.gmail.com>

I apologise to all members for a temporary glitch in the INDOLOGY service
during the last couple of hours.  It is now fixed and normal service
resumed.

Best,
Dominik Wujastyk
INDOLOGY committee member
