[INDOLOGY] Sanskrit idiom question
Namo vidvadbhya?: I would be grateful for help with determining whether 
a phrase (so far located only in a single manuscript of the 
/H?yanaratna/) is an idiomatic Sanskrit expression unknown to me or a 
corrupt reading. The verse in question runs:
candre vibale na sy?d yadi cendu? kr?ravarjito ?nyena |
da?amad??_?dir __dv?ra? kurute_ tat ki?cid ?pnoti ||
'If the moon is weak, it [= gaining a kingdom] will not happen, but if 
the moon, free from malefics, (xxx xxx xxx) with another [planet] by a 
tenth-[sign] aspect, then [the querent] gains something.'
I have never encountered the expression /dv?ra? k?-/ or anything like 
it, but that in itself doesn't mean a lot.
Thanks in avance for any suggestions,
Martin Gansten
