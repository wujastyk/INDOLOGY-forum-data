I've been following news of the revisions, and in general they have reflected a very poor level of scholarship and writing in the textbooks in general-- not only in regard to characterizations of caste and ancient Hinduism, but also in regard to Buddhism, Islam, Sikhism, Christianity, etc. In addition to pressure from interest groups, the consolidation of commercial interests in textbook publishing in the United States has led to a depressing state of affairs in which quality of materials suffers to market dynamics.
