[INDOLOGY] Buddhist murals Sri Lanka Vessantara-Jataka
Dear Fumi, Christoph and Seishi,
thank you very much for your help. So I came back to the roots, to Alsdorf.
Lately I came across this stanza in the Pali-version.
The Sinhalese version appears to be more close to this Pali-stanza than 
the Pali-commentary.
While writing about this mural I am staying in Sri Lanka.
I will try to contact my friends at the LMU in Munich to send me a copy 
of that article.
Best regards
Heiner
