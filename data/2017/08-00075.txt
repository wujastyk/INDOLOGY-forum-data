Thank you, Professor Karashima, for documenting that Jacobi?s text had a corrected printing. This seems unusual, especially if your copy is not officially a second printing or the like.
In any case, we agree that pa?ka ?mud? and its Apabhra??a form pa?ku are not the subject of my inquiry. I am only interested in any evidences (especially in devan?gar? and other north Indian script mss) of a reading pa?ku (pa?ku)  Sanskrit pa?gu ?lame?.
I attach jpegs of details showing the ny?yaka?ik? manuscript readings I mentioned in the original message in this thread. The original manuscript is in the Nepal National Archives. I have no images of ju?adhva?kara?? or svadita?kara??.
Best wishes,
Elliot Stern
