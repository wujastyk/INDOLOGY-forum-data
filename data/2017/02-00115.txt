I would add the pustakalaya 'library' can mean 'publishing house'.
Can't sampadita mean 'assembled' or 'collected' in addition to completed?

Also:
Bhasabhasya and bhasatika. ?Vernacular commentary. My impression is that the first often means not quite a commentary but a somewhat expanded translation into a modern language, while the second may mean more what we usually mean by 'commentary'. ?What do others think?
