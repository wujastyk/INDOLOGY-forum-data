[INDOLOGY] [RISA-L LIST] New Book
Dear Prof. Dominik Wjastyk,
"a point of view that certainly exists in the minds of some people"
certainly provides an exception to my
'I can say with certainty that ancient India was never imagined during or
later to the independence movement, either by the educated Indians or by
the common public as an India without wars or without harsh punishments or
without harsh ways of crime control etc. ?'
Are books written to counter 'a point of view that  exists in the minds of
some people' ?
