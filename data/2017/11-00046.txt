The Persian version mentioned by Tyler is more precisely a version of the one in 
Purnabhadra's Pancatantra, Book I.

(In the Persian version, a merchant leaves an amount of iron with a neighbor, who sells it, 
telling the merchant that it has been eaten by mice. The merchant kidnaps the man's son, 
and tells him that a hawk carried the boy off. The punchline is the same: in a town where 
mice can eat iron, certainly a hawk can pick up a boy.)

    Dear Greg, 

    This story does indeed appear in the Kathasaritasagara, and in the Persian Anvar-i 
    Suhaili. Sorry that I don't have the exact reference.

    Best,
    Tyler

    Dear Lost,

    A friend who is not on the list asked me for some information about this 
    brief story which he believes may be expressed in a few ?slokas. It strikes 
    me that it may come from somewhere in the Kath?sarits?gara. Any 
    suggestions would be much appreciated.

    
    I am writing to get some reference to a Sanskrit stanza (Shloka) which 
    relates to an ancient Indian story. To put this in context the story 
    goes as follows:
    
    An itinerant trader leaves a bowl made of gold for safe-keeping with a 
    friend, to look after it while he is away. On his return, the trader 
    finds that the friend had substituted the bowl to one of brass. The 
    trader realizes that he had been cheated but says nothing. Years later 
    the friend asks the trader to teach his son the art of trading. The 
    trader takes the son to his home. A few years later, the friend comes 
    to pick his son, but finds to his horror the son tied to a tree like a 
    monkey and trained to act like one. Aghast, the friend asks what 
    happened. And the trader replies, "Just like gold can turn to brass, so 
    can a boy turn to a monkey".
    
    There is, I believe, a Sanskrit shloka which tells this story in verse. 
    I am looking for a reference to the Sanskrit text.

    Cheers,

    Greg Bailey
