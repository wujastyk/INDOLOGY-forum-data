The John P Clay Graduate Scholarship in Manuscript and Text Cultures: Sanskrit at The Queen's College, Oxford
Dear All,
The Queen's College, Oxford is pleased to offer, beginning in Michaelmas Term 2018, a fully-funded graduate scholarship for up to a maximum of three years for a DPhil student in Oriental Studies whose research focuses on Manuscript and Text Cultures with a special focus on Sanskrit (including all areas, historical periods, and aspects of this field).
The John P Clay Graduate Scholarship in Manuscript and Text Cultures: Sanskrit covers course fees, college fees and a grant for living costs at the same rate as provided by Clarendon Scholarships. Awards are made for the period of fee liability for the agreed course.
The John P Clay Graduate Scholarship in Manuscript and Text Cultures: Sanskrit has been established thanks to a generous donation by the JJC Foundation (founded by John P Clay, Oriental Studies, 1954 and his wife Jennifer Coutts Clay) in support of Manuscript and Text Cultures: Sanskrit at The Queen's College.
Applications are invited from suitably qualified individuals who are applying to a DPhil course at the Faculty of Oriental Studies for entry in October 2018, or current students studying for a DPhil at the Faculty of Oriental Studies.

The successful candidate will be expected to engage closely with its research cluster on Manuscript and Text Cultures (https://www.queens.ox.ac.uk/workshop-manuscript-and-text-cultures).
The scholarship is open to UK, EU, or Overseas students.
