Re: [INDOLOGY] K???a / ?ukla YV
Hello Christopher,
     The probable early reference to this distinction is in the
Br?had?ra?yaka Upani?ad (BU 6.5.3: ?ukl?ni yaj???i), where ?a?kara explains
the phrased as "avy?mi?r??i br?hma?ena" (not mixed with Br?hma?a).  It is
possible that ?a?kara is imposing an interpretation on the word ?ukla that
was current in later times.  The full blown use of the terms kr???a and
?ukla to refer to different branches of Yajurveda is much later.  The
Vedavic?ra of ??ma??str? Dravi?a Dvived? that I am editing offers another
very curious explanation of these terms:
"?????????????????? ??????? ????? ?????????????? ? ?? ?? ??????????
??????????????????????????????????????????? ?????????????????????????????
????????????? ??? ?????? ?????????? ????? ????? ?"
Here the distinction between kr???a and ?ukla Yajurveda is related to when
the Up?kara?a is performed.  For the ?ukla Yajurvedins, it is performed at
the juncture of Caturda?? and Paur?im?, and hence it falls in the
?uklapak?a of the lunar month.  For the Kr???a Yajurvedins, the Up?kara?a
is performed at the juncture of Paur?im? and Pratipad, and hence it falls
in the Kr???apak?a of the lunar month.  I have not checked if this is the
actual practice of these different communities.  However, my author seems
to suggest that.  It is doubtful if the terms Kr???a and ?ukla originate
with this ritual distinction.  My guess is that it is the ?ukla Yajurvedins
who began calling their Yajurveda with the term ?ukla to suggest that
Y?j?avalkya's new Yajurveda was more pure than the old Yajurveda which he
stripped off from his body and returned to his Guru Vai?amp?yana.  These
stories are found in the Bh?gavata and Vi??upur??a etc., and are quoted by
Vedavic?ra.
