Raffaele Torella has just informed me that his message below may not have

Subject: Re: [INDOLOGY] Andr? Padoux


Whenever I visited Paris I never missed to visit Andr? at his home in rue
S?guier, and once also at his country house along with my family. By saying
Andr? I implicitly also refer to his wonderful wife, Anne-C?cile (it is
often true that very close to each great man there also is a great woman).
The last years of Andr? were deeply saddened by the tragic and absurd death
of Anne-C?cile, yet he found the courage and energy to continue, some way
ot other, his life as a man (or to be more precise, as a great gentleman)
and a scholar.  I bitterly miss the great man and scholar he was.
