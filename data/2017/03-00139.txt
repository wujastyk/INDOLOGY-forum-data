Dear Suresh,

I apologize for the length of this reply. Thank you for the interesting information from the Telugu Bh?gavatam.  As we can agree, the objective of BhP here is to answer the question of how K???a can engage in apparently immoral actions. In Prabhup?da?s translation, BhP 10.33.29 says: "?ukadeva Gosv?m? said: The status of powerful controllers is not harmed by any apparently audacious transgression of morality we may see in them, for they are just like fire, which devours everything fed into it and remains unpolluted."
If this is all BhP says, the traditional interpretation of ??varas as gods might have been all right.

But as I discussed earlier, BhP does not say straightaway whatever K???a does is morally right. It builds the case by first identifying some lesser beings with some qualifications and then arguing comparatively if the fruits of the actions of those lesser beings do not affect those beings, then how what their Lord, who has created everything, can be affected by what he does. 

As for the the action of Rudra consuming poison, the comparison should be taken as limited to being an example of a dangerous action by a powerful person. After all, the action of ?iva consuming poison is not immoral. If anything, it is a very altruistic action. This example does not address the basic issue of immorality of action at all. As a result, BhP cannot say that if ?iva is not affected by his actions, K???a will not be affected by his actions, as it says in verses 10.33.33 and 10.33.34.  So this example should not be taken as suggesting that the ??varas referred to are gods.

One could cite many different miraculous/dangerous actions by many gods from the pu???as. BhP's choice of this action of ?iva as an example makes sense if one considers the use of ???v?r' in the Tamil country of the 10th century and earlier. Given the predominance of ?aiva temples, the name ??v?r, was used often to refer to ?iva. So, in my opinion, the use of this example simply illustrated the great power of the Vai??ava saints who were referred to by the same name as ?iva. Indeed, Tamil Lexicon glosses the word ??v?r as given below.

??????? ??v?r, n. < ???-. The Deity, as supreme ruler; ??????. ?????????????? ??????? ??????? ?????? ?????????? (S.I.I. iii, 103).

Interestingly, the example cited by Tamil Lexicon is from an inscription (South Indian Inscriptions, vol. 3, no. 50, p. 103) of ca. 991 CE during the reign of R?jar?ja I in the ?iva temple at Tiruvallam in northern Tamil Nadu. Interestingly, another inscription in the same place (SII, vol. 3, no. 49, p. 102) in year 991 has the form ??v?r instead of ??v?r. By the 12th century, even among the Tamil Vai??avas, the memory of the original form (??var) was lost. So, if there had been a Tamil Bh?gavatam in the 12th century, I would not be surprised to see in it an interpretation of ??vara as gods like that in the Telugu Bh?gavatam too. 

But such an interpretation gives rise to violations of the fundamental requirement of being unaffected by any act of impropriety. Indra is a prime example of such a violation. After all, Indra was badly affected by what he did to Ahaly?. Candra has been said to be affected by his transgressions too, which resulted in waning and waxing and blemishes on the face. 

Also, any interpretation of ??varas has to satisfy the three requirements of (1) multiple ??varas, (2) sayings considered to be true by the Vai??ava tradition, and (3) being without ego. Certainly Indra and Candra cannot be said to be without ego. 

Even in the case of salvific power, one can argue that in the Tamil Vai??ava bhakti tradition, the Vai??ava ??vars were superior to ?iva. The solitary verse of N?tamuni I had mentioned earlier in praise of Maturakavi ??v?r (>??v?r) brings this out. In his poems, Maturakavi did not praise V???u at all. He only praised M??a? Ca?ak?pa? (Namm??v?r>Namm??v?r). N?tamu?i praised Maturakavi as follows:
"Maturakavi who said in praise, 'I do not know anything else. M??a? Ca?ak?pa? who created Vedas in Tamil and is the chief of fertile Kuruk?r is our life,' is our lord. He is our refuge indeed.? 

According to BhP, even ?iva has to seek refuge at K???a?s feet. But, Maturakavi says, ? t?vu ma??u a?iy??? (Ka??i Nu? Ci?utt?mpu 2) meaning "I do not know any other god.?  He does not pay homage to any god, but seeks refuge only in Ca?ak?pa?, another ??var. Here Ca?ak?pa? is a virtual surrogate for K???a. 

Beyond this, there is another interesting thing. Tracy Coleman translates BhP 10.33.34 as, "If even the sages satisfied by worshipping the dust of his lotus-feet live spontaneously, not being bound, their every bond of karma cast off by the power of yoga?then how can He who becomes embodied intentionally ever be bound??

The mention of a devotee who has the power of yoga is noteworthy. N?tamu?i (N??hamuni) was not only a devotee of Vi??u but also said to be an excellent yogi according to the Stotraratna  of Yamun?c?rya. and N?thamuni is also mentioned as the author of the Yogarahasyam by Ved?ntade?ika in his Rahasyatrayas?ram.  Based on these, BhP 10.33.34 seems to be referring to N?thamuni and possibly either his father or son called ??varamuni. 

So, BhP in 10.33.29-34 seems to be referring to the ??v?r saints, N??hamuni, and possibly ??varamuni, all of whom are devotees of Vi??u and not gods. 

I would appreciate very much if you could tell me if/how the Telugu Bh?gavatam handles BhP 11.5.38-40 in which Ved?ntade?ika sees reference to teachers such as N?thamuni, son of ??varamuni.

Thanks in advance

Palaniappan
