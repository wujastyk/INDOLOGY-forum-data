I was surprised to see that in the lists of gotras circulated on the web,
in many cases, the "sa" of "X-sagotra" has been attached to the name of the
gotra itself, i.e. "Xsa".  One can see several examples in the list below:
http://familypedia.wikia.com/wiki/Brahmin_gotra_system
This list includes "?treyasa", for instance, as a gotra-name.  The only way
I can think how this came about is a misanalysis of "?treya-sagotra" as
"?treyasa-gotra."  I have not checked the names listed in texts like the
Gotra-pravara-ma?jar? to see if this phenomenon has affected the lists in
Sanskrit texts as well.
