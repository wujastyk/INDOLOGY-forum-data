[INDOLOGY] The pre-natal/pre-incarnatory curse in Indian literature
Alf's example brings in a very good analogous narrative to that of
"sage Vi?ravas?
pre-natal, even pre-conception, curse of R?va?a, Kumbhakar?a and ??rpa?akh?
to be monstrous  because their mother-to be, Kaikas?, approached him at a
bad time."
Alf was cautious and said, " Vyasa's words (are they a curse?) "
Yes, that care is important even in the case of the sage Vis'ravas' words.
Are they a curse? Perhaps not.
In both the cases, a statement of the consequence of nishiddhakarma appears
to be a curse.
