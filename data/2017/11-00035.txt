A short but thoughtful overview of some of the difficulties of
characterizing the relationship between written texts and oral culture has
been given by Orsini and Schofield in *Tellings...* And then of course
Pollock compares the relationship between 'literacy' and writing in S. Asia
and Europe in *Language of the Gods*.
And, at the risk of self-promotion, I discuss these issues in the context
of early modern North India in my dissertation, which is available through
Columbia U's website.
All best,
