Subject: [INDOLOGY] PDF Copy of "Philosophical Implications of Dhvani"
Message-ID: <CAJz4T_4kcEhOe+Vun+qu2+CS9ooRo5Ruf8hyAPwFs+K7QCh1bw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Friends,

I am not sure if I should be asking for this since the title is
not published too long ago. In fact I have my personal copy, but it is too
far away from me (in my home-library). But I am still taking a chance and
wondering if someone might have a PDF of the following title:


*Philosophical Implications of Dhvani: Experience of Symbol Language in
Indian Aesthetics, Anand Amaladass, Indologisches Institut der Universit?t
Wien, 1984.*

I should be grateful if someone can share off-list.

Thanks and best wishes.

Mrinal
