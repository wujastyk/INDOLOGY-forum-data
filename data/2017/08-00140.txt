[INDOLOGY] PDF Copy of "Philosophical Implications of Dhvani"
Dear Friends,
I am not sure if I should be asking for this since the title is
not published too long ago. In fact I have my personal copy, but it is too
far away from me (in my home-library). But I am still taking a chance and
wondering if someone might have a PDF of the following title:
*Philosophical Implications of Dhvani: Experience of Symbol Language in
Indian Aesthetics, Anand Amaladass, Indologisches Institut der Universit?t
Wien, 1984.*
I should be grateful if someone can share off-list.
Thanks and best wishes.
Mrinal
