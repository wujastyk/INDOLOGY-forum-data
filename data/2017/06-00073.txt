Dear Antonia,

I second Madhav?s suggestion to include passages from the Mah?bh??ya, and I would narrow that down to selections from the Paspa??, because of its beautiful dialogic structure.

Are you thinking of including something on the Vedas (like Lanman)? If so, you might want to consult my Upani?adic Reader, which I developed as a first introduction to Vedic (Lanman?s jumping directly into the Rig Veda was too much for our students).

Best wishes,

Hans Henrich Hock

Dear Antonia,

     Short passages from Pata?jali's Mah?bh??ya, ?abara's M?m??s?s?trabh??ya, ?a?kara's and R?m?nuja's Ved?ntas?trabh??yas would be very useful.  Similarly, small portions of introductory ??stric texts like the Tarkasa?graha, Ved?ntaparibh??? and M?m??s?-Ny?ya-Prak??a would be useful. Along with K?vyas, I would suggest including a sample act of drama, and a short section from K?vya??stra.  I am assuming that your book would serve as an introduction to Sanskrit literature in a wide sense of the term.  I am looking forward to your work.

Dear Dr. Ruppel,

Congratulations on your contract, and thanks for undertaking such a useful project.  I am retired from teaching, but I applaud this project nonetheless.

My principal suggestion is to include, perhaps toward the end of the reader, samples of commentarial literature.  Vy?kara?a and dharma??stra are good fishing ponds for such texts, but the field matters less than providing the learner with samples of commentarial style.

With all best wishes,
Rosane Rocher

Dear all,

I just received a contract to write a new intermediate Sanskrit Reader -- a 21st-century Lanman, if you will. Its aims will be to help students apply and practice their grammar knowledge, increase their vocabulary and their reading stamina, and give them a taste of a broader variety of Sanskrit textual genres.

Each text extract will be up to about ten pages long and come with an introduction, as well as grammar and vocabulary notes on every page. Several members of this list have already very kindly made excellent suggestions for texts or text excerpts that they would like to see included in the Reader; but given the wonderful breadth and enormous collective experience of this list, I would like to ask all of you: are there any texts or even specific passages that you have always wished existed in a format suited for presentation to intermediate students?

The more broadly useful the Reader might prove to the members of our field who are involved in Sanskrit instruction, the better; so if you have any suggestions or ideas, I would love to hear them. I am of course very happy to give credit to anyone who shares their thoughts with me.

If you have any questions about how I am intending to structure the Reader, what I am so far planning to include etc, please don't hesitate to ask.

All the best,
   Antonia
