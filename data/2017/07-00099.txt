[INDOLOGY] BHAMATI
 Dr.Sathaye,
                I do humbly submit  that I sincerely had no intention of violating  any 
Indology Forum practices. The Title was in All-caps owing to the fact that Bhamati is the name 
of a book written by Bachaspati Mishra , and it is a proper noun.( incidentally it is the name 
of a person)  Please excuse me if it has caused any confusion for anybody. I just wanted to 
know the meaning/implication of some words in Bhamati and nothing more than that.I wonder how 
it came in as an attachment, in the light of the fact that I just repeated my query after a 
few days. 
                      Finally,it goes without saying that  I have been greatly benefitted  
through my association with Indology Forum .
                                                      ALAKENDU DAS.
