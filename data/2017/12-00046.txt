Dear Scholars,

	The famous mantra ?purnam adah purnam idam?? appears in Brhadaranyaka Up 5.1.1.  It also appears at the beginning of the Isopanisad, in some texts as an ?Invocation,? at times as part of the text itself.

	I would appreciate an explanation of this mantra?s status in the Isopanisad. 

Thanks!
Howard
