I once again turn to the vaidyavids on this list in hope of 
enlightenment. Balabhadra in his 17th-century /H?yanaratna/ writes of an 
astrological configuration:

/atra teja?si?hena samarasi?hena ca ?anid???i? vin? r?k??dirog?? prokt?? 
| ?anid???au tu j?pyat? n?ma kutsito roga ukta? | /

'On this [matter], Teja?si?ha and Samarasi?ha state that [even] without 
the aspect of Saturn, there are diseases such as dryness, but if Saturn 
aspects, there is said to be the vile disease called /j?pyat?/.'

Does anyone know what condition this might be? I have so far found only 
one other occurrence of /j?pyat?/, in Var?hamihira's /Yogay?tr?/ 
(10.57), which is not very illuminating:

/dak?i?e ?ubham at?va ?obhana? p?pam apy ativir?pam anyata? |//
//j?pyat? bhavati tadviparyaye vistaro 'nyamunibhi? prak?rtita? ||//
/
The alternative word division /j?pyat?n?m akutsito /seems likewise 
unpromising.
