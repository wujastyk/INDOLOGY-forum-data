[INDOLOGY] Warder Sanskrit Reader
Dear David,
That's fantastic! I wasn't aware that a third volume was even produced -
let alone a devanagari volume! I don't think any of the OPAC catalogues
record this information!! The photos I have of the Notes tome must be from
Volume 3!!
I will scan Volume 1 and send it through to Antonia, James & yourself later
this week. Together we should be able to put together a complete edition
available in an open, accessible place very soon!
Kind regards,
Antonio
