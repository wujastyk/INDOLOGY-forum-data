Nothing to do with possession, etc., but like Nagaraj, I thought of 
/g?haprave?a/, and also of /var?aprave?a/, which is the (T?jika) 
astrological term for what is traditionally called the revolution of the 
year in English (and /ta?w?l as-sana/ in Arabic, which was the language 
of the T?jika source texts) -- that is, the moment at which the sun 
returns to the zodiacal position it occupied at a person's birth, and 
for which a new horoscope is cast to determine his or her prospects for 
the coming year.
