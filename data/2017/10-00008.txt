[INDOLOGY] Fwd: Sanskrit-speaking village article
Thanks Madhavji, for appreciating the view. You are the expert on the
sociology of Sanskrit-Prakrit. Among the simultaneously equally valid views
of 1. Sanskrit as the refined version of Prakrit and 2. Prakrit as the
rustic version of Sanskrit, your example supports #1, Patrick-ji's
observation supports #2. #1 is supported by the etymologies of the names
Sanskrit and Prakrit. #2 is what is opined by Bhartrihari and others in
verses such as amb?mb?ti yath? b?lah.
