Thank you, Walter, for these instances from the Mok?op?ya and for the 
reference to your paper, which I'll make sure to look up. As you say, 
the verses seem primarily to criticize the notion of fate or daiva, or 
at least of fate as more powerful than human effort. (Most astrologers 
would probably consider these to be straw-man arguments, but that's 
another matter.) The question they raise in my mind is whether the fate 
rejected by the author includes karma, as daiva is often equated with 
pr?rabdha-karma (/p?rvajanmak?ta? karma tad daivam iti kathyate, 
/ity?di). Do we know?

Of course, from a radical non-dualist perspective, sa?s?ra in its 
entirety, including cause and effect, karma and phala, etc, is illusory. 
Is that the perspective behind the Mok?op?ya's rejection of fate, or is 
the argument made on the level of 'conventional truth'? I am primarily 
interested in the latter: authors who argue that, for instance, karma is 
real, but astrology is false.

Thanks again,
Martin
