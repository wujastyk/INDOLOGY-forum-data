[INDOLOGY] Font?
Dear Jonathan,
     I just now installed the Asian Extended US, and noticed that with this
Keyboard I can type "r?", but the long "?" appears with an underdot, rather
than a circle under the character, and there does not seem to be a way to
do "l" with a circle underneath.  There must be a way to do these things in
Unicode.
