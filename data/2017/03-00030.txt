[INDOLOGY] Query
Allen's article is about Vidura telling Dhr?tar???ra about a brahmin hanging upside down above a pit (MBh  11, 5-6) and about Jaratk?ru's ancestors from MBh 1, 13.9 ff, 1, 41, and 3, 94ff. The quotation from Barlam and Iosapath with which Allen opens the article reads: Than he loked downwards into the pyttes grounde, and there he sawe an horrible dragoun ... He had his mowthe euer open and euer redy to have deuowred hym. In the passage quoted in the previous mail Allen seems to imply that this particular motif is also present in Chavanne's Chinese version. I do not think that he is claiming that there is a Chines Barlam. He hope this helps. H

Dear Herman,
The citation from Allen is puzzling. He seems to be saying that there are
recognizable ME and Chinese versions of Barlam, but at the end of the quote
is referring to Vidura's story. As I don't think that there is a Chinese version of
Barlam, is there perhaps something missing from the citation? Or is it
just a poorly constructed sentence?
