Dear Dhaval,

the verse of *KP *is 67.57:

*The Goddess Yoganidr? having been concealed in me *[?iva]*, myself having
the form of a mountain, and the female organ *[yoni]* of the goddess having
been fallen on that mountain, the mountain turned into dark blue.*  (trans.
B. Shastri [1991] 2008)

Best,
Paolo
