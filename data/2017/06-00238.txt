[INDOLOGY] Sanskrit Readers: overview
Dear Antonia,
Since you are compiling a bibliography, a mention should be made here of
Gary Tubb's Reader in Intermediate Sanskrit, produced during his time at
Columbia (specifically, 1999). I don't think it was ever published, but it
consists of several fascicles covering different genres of Sanskrit texts
of intermediate difficulty. I have seen one on the Mahabharata and another
one on "Sanskrit Narrative Verse from Medieval Kashmir," drawing from the
Brhatkathamanjari, Kathasaritsagara, and the Laghuyogavasistha. I remember
having seen a third fascicle on the Bhagavadgita, but may be confabulating.
The reader is in Lanman style, but with the vocabulary and notes following
each selection. The vocabulary does not included what is in Goldman and
Sutherland's Devavanipravesika, which was presumably the primer of choice
at that time at Columbia.
All best,
Aleksandar
