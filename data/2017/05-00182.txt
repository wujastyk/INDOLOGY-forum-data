I am away from my desk and do not have my Bhoja commentary at hand, but I
am assuming Bhoja is quoting those two verses, yes, rather than composing
them  (in other words they preexisted him)? Or is this not clear from the
Sanskrit?  If Bhoja is quoting an older reference then this is the
terminus ad quem of the notion of the 'three Patanjali's' howsoever
ghostly the Ayurvedic one turns out to be.

While on the topic, zeSa in the Vaishnava literature is a derivative form
of Vishnu. So the second of the two Patanjali verses can be seen as
pointing to an association of Patanjali with Vishnu going back at least
that far. A couple of questions here: given that while Vishnu bears a
zaNkha and cakra, he does not hold a sword, asi, in  normative
iconographical representations, does anyone know of any Vishnu forms
bearing one (I assume only these three items (zaNkkacakrAsi dhArinam) are
mentioned in the verse due to metrical considerations).  And, secondly,
are there any  Saivite references at this time  associating zeSA WITH
ziva?.

Thanks.  Edwin Bryant
