[INDOLOGY] HTML definition of Unicode characters for r and l with "underring"?
What is wrong with combinations? Anyone computing with Unicode should be
able to understand a combining character as a part of the preceding
character.
For characters such as ?, ?, ?, ?, no one should use any private area
characters. They are not officially sanctioned.
The official character combination for ? is: r? (r + 0x325)
The official character combination for ? is: r?? (r + x0325 + x0304)
The official character combination for ? is: l? (l + 0x325)
The official character combination for ? is: l?? (l + x0325 + x0304)
