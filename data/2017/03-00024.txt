[INDOLOGY] pravesha
jalaprav??a is a form of committing suicide. But jal?dhiv?s is a temple
ritual, a sculpture /idol installation related ritual.
d?v?layaprav??a seems to be a neologism coined during modern
anti-untouchability movements. not a ritual term.
r??iprav??a is an astrological term. not a ritual term.
