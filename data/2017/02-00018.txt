Subject: [INDOLOGY] Taittiriya Pratisakya and gumkara
Message-ID: <CAPW7aQH4sxxA8oef2UZXroB6hqmKLYPA6L23VpDpTSbDfyCkzg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list members,

In the chanting of the taittiriya samhita anusvara is pronounced as the so
called gumkara before sibilants, r and visarga.  A kind of "gum" or "gu"
sound.

I couldn't find any mention of the gumkara pronounciation of anusvara
before sibilants and snd visarga in the taittiriya pratisakhya.  My search
was somewhat superficial. I looked at Whitneys english translation using
the index entries for anusvara.

Can any list member confirm that the taittiriya pratisakhya doesn't have
any mention of pronouncing anusvara as "gum" beforre sibilants, r and
visarga.

If that is the case what does that mean? Does that mean the gumkara
pronounciation of anusvara in the taittiriya samhita is a post vedic
innovation?? And if so how late an innovation would it be?

Thanks,
Harry Spier
