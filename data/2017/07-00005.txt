Dear list members,
In a passage dealing with possible sources of inspiration of K?lid?sa's Meghad?ta Chintaharan Chakravarti (Indian Historical Quarterly 3 (1927), pp. 286 ff) mentions a certain Hs? Kan (196-221 AD), who in his Chinese translation of N?g?rjuna's Praj??m?la??stra??k? describes a woman who requests a cloud to pass on a message to her far-away husband. I would like to know where I can find more information about this translator Hs? Kan, in particular his date and if something is known about his knowledge of Sanskrit K?vya literature.
Best, Herman
