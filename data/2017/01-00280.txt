[INDOLOGY] INDUS CIVILISATION.
Dear George,
You write about the pop article on the so-called Indus script posted on Indology:
Could I ask you again ? and the moderators too ? to stop your repeated ad hominem attacks on me on this and other scholarly Lists. Those attacks have gone on now repeatedly for 12 years ? to 2005! ? and have nothing to do with Indology or scholarship.
And they certainly don?t have anything to do with the so-called Indus script issue. You in fact endorsed the findings that Michael and Richard and I published on the nonlinguistic nature of Indus symbols in 2004. That paper has now been downloaded over two million times since it was published and Science magazine called attention to it late that year. 
More copies are still being downloaded of it 13 years later, which suggests something about its impact. You were even thanked in our acknowledgements of the paper, as you?ll see on page 49 of the paper, at the head of a List of 17 others. :)

In any event, could I politely ask you to end your ad hominem attacks on me on the Indology List, on which I?ve certainly never said personal about you? If you want to discuss something substantial about the Indus symbols, I?m happy to talk about it, although nothing new or interesting really has been said about this topic now for many years ? and the current research I?m doing is in far different topics?
Peace! Let personal bygones go?.. :)
Best wishes,
Steve Farmer
