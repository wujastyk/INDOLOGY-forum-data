[INDOLOGY] On DharmaKriti
Dear Alakendu Das,
Generally, Dharmak?rti is thought to flourish between 600-660, however I?d
refer you to my paper
?On the Relative Chronology of Dharmak?rti and Samantabhadra,? *Journal of
Indian Philosophy* 42 (2014) 1-47, available here:
www.balcerowicz.eu/indology/balcerowicz2014b.pdf
It provides (perhaps the most up-to-date) review of his dates and new
dating based on additional, non-Buddhist references.
Best regards,
Piotr Balcerowicz

philosopher existed?
