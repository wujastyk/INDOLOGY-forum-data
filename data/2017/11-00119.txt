Dear Alakendu Das,

Generally, Dharmak?rti is thought to flourish between 600-660, however I?d
refer you to my paper

?On the Relative Chronology of Dharmak?rti and Samantabhadra,? *Journal of
Indian Philosophy* 42 (2014) 1-47, available here:
www.balcerowicz.eu/indology/balcerowicz2014b.pdf

It provides (perhaps the most up-to-date) review of his dates and new
dating based on additional, non-Buddhist references.

Best regards,

Piotr Balcerowicz

To All,
Can anybody enlighten me on the probable time in History when
DharmaKriti,the authour of 'Pramana Varttikka' and renowned Buddhsit
philosopher existed?

ALAKENDU DAS.
