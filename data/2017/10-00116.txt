[INDOLOGY] Vedic citation
I need help in locating a Vedic passage about gods giving different boons to women. This is given also in Baudh?yan Dh S  (2.4.5) and Vasi??ha Dh S (28.6). But in the original version women ask the gods to give them the power to have sex anytime. I have used this passage in the past, but now cannot put my finger on it. Can anyone trace the passage? I?d be very grateful. Thanks.
