?I think that this mixture is preserved in some older strata of Buddhist
scriptures and epics by chance, while, in other later texts, either verses
 were composed in pure
Tri??ubh
?-metre or in pure
Jagat?
? metre from the beginning, as in the cases of ?
the Avad?na?ataka,
? ?
Divy?vad?na
?, ?
Ud?navarga
?,
Mah?y?nas?tr?la?k?ra
? etc., or the mixed verses were standardized by later redactors, as in the
case of the Gilgit-Nepalese recension of the Saddharmapu??ar?ka. To my
opinion, in early times, this mixture was
probably considered as stylistically elaborate
? --- therefore not hyper-metrical?
, but later it
? came to be regarded as odd. By comparing Sanskrit fragments from Central
Asia, which generally preserve older readings, and their parallel (newer)
Nepalese manuscripts of Buddhist scriptures, one can trace this shift.

With best wishes,
