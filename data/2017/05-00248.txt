Greetings,

I've been unable to locate vol. 4 of the Grantha Ratna Mala (published
from Varanasi) on archive.org or the other digital libraries. The library
holdings on Wordlcat lack this volume. I did, however, find volumes 1 & 2
on Hathi Trust, but that's all. If anyone has a pdf of this volume, or
knows where to download, I would much appreciate it.

best,
