Subject: [INDOLOGY] Two printed miniatures of Bhagavad Gita
In-Reply-To: <HE1PR0202MB26519F18F7054E99C813EFD5EC5C0@HE1PR0202MB2651.eurprd02.prod.outlook.com>

The one in the Imperial War Museum must date from World War I (1914-18), and was (according to their notes) made to be sent to Hindu prisoners of War. On the same page there are links to a miniature Koran for Muslim POWs. There were a great many South Asian troops fighting for the allies in WW1, and serious efforts were made to accommodate their religious and cultural needs. See the works of David Omissi of the University of Hull, e.g. Indian Voices of the Great War.

Best wishes

On the last page I read SaMvat 1990 and Sak 1855, which means roughly 1933 according to the Gregorian Calendar. The language style of the publisher?s page is old, so this must be a reprint of some kind. Does anybody know if it came as miniature back in 1933? (I tried to contact the publisher, but no response so far, and the website has been down for a long, long time).
