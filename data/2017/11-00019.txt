[INDOLOGY] Two printed miniatures of Bhagavad Gita
The one in the Imperial War Museum must date from World War I (1914-18), and was (according to their notes) made to be sent to Hindu prisoners of War. On the same page there are links to a miniature Koran for Muslim POWs. There were a great many South Asian troops fighting for the allies in WW1, and serious efforts were made to accommodate their religious and cultural needs. See the works of David Omissi of the University of Hull, e.g. Indian Voices of the Great War.
