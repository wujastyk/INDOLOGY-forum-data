[INDOLOGY] Muktabodha at 20 Years: An Invitation to AAR Tea
Dear All,
The Muktabodha Indological Research Institute is celebrating its 20th
anniversary this year. As chair of Muktabodha's Academic Advisory Council,
I would like to extend a warm invitation from the Board of Directors to
join us for a celebratory tea in Boston, held in conjunction with the
annual American Academy of Religion Conference this November.
The tea will take place on Saturday, November 18, from 5:30-7:30 at the
Westin Copley Palace Hotel Newbury & Gloucester Rooms (10 Huntington Ave,
Boston, MA).
Please see attached invitation flyer for details.
Warm regards,
Mark
