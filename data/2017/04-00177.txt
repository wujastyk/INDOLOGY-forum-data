Dear All,
I am not sure whether it is already beyond the expiry date of "droits
d'auteur" but I guess that should be now or next year.
For the moment I have here a link to my dropbox for a scan of this landmark
study by Louis Renou
https://www.dropbox.com/s/a4lvgvbxr7ozix8/Les%20ecoles%20vediques%20et%20la%
20formation%20du%20Veda.%28L.Renou%29%28Paris%2C1947%29%
28600dpi%2Clossy%29.pdf?dl=0
 -- which is naturally frequently referred to by contributors to the
volume *Vedic
??kh?s: past, present, future* ?  HOS   Opera Minora IX ? Cambridge (Mass.)
2016 (announced earlier on this list and available at southasiabooks.com
for ca. 30$).
If I am not mistaken Prof. Thite made an English translation which is not
yet published.
