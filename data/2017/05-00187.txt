[INDOLOGY] Patanjali in the Puranas?
stanza.
It is neither shared by Wilhelm Rau (*Bhart?haris V?kyapad?ya*, 2002: 38)
when he translates:
?Die Beseitigung der Beschmutzungen, welche sich auf K?rper, Rede und
Erkenntnisverm?gen beziehen, findet [entsprechend] statt durch die
Heilkunde,
die Grammatik und das auf den ?tman bez?gliche Handbuch.?
Though translating the phrase *cikits?lak?a??dhy?tma??strais*
in a somewhat awkward manner, it is clear that there was no reference
to any person/Pata?jali for him in VP I.174.
Correctly, in my view, Rau rather emphasized the correlation
between *k?yav?gbuddhi* and *cikits?lak?a??dhy?tma*, that is,
when Bhart?hari expresses that each of the three modes of human existence
? the 3rd personal dimension of organic organisation (*k?ya*), the
linguistic means
of communication (*v?k*) in the intersubjective 2nd personal dimension, as
well as
first personal (self-referential) dimension of intelligent cognition (
*buddhi*) ?
has its particular range of relevant means (elucidated in pertinent
treatises) to remedy
what's improper.
