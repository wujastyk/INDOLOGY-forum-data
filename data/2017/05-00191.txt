[INDOLOGY] Help needed
Dear colleagues,
could anyone help me scanning a few pages or giving place where the text is found. I would like to see what lies behind a rather obscure reference to V. Bhattacharyya, The ?gama??stra of Gau?ap?da (Calcutta 1943), pp. LXXII-LXXIV. The book is not found in any libraries here.
Best,
Klaus
