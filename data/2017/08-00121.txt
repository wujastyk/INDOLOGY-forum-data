[INDOLOGY] Gita 13.6
Dear Howard, and all
My two cents: Yoga/Bhakti is a procedural theory of ethics. Procedural 
theories prioritize the right (action, procedure, means) over the good 
(outcome, end, manifest thing).? The most procedural theory we have in 
the Western tradition is what the Gita calls "Karma Yoga," 
and they are justified by way of procedural considerations, not the ends.
Yoga/Bhakti in contrast defines the thing to be done by a procedural 
ideal---the Lord---and the good as the perfection of this practice. 
Hence, we shouldn't strive for the good, nor should we justify actions 
by their outcomes. We should rather understand proper action as an 
approximation to the Lord which defines the right, and the good 
automatically follows as a perfection of this practice.? In effect, we 
instantiate Lordliness as we perfect the practice of devotion to the Lord.
As the Lord is a procedural ideal, that is only manifest when we make 
perfect our devotion to it, it is in abstraction always unmanifest. But 
it can also become manifest too as a matter of its expression in a world 
devoted to It.
I have written about this in a few articles of late. Here's one:
"Bhagavad G?t?: The Dialectic of Four Moral Theories 
<https://philpapers.org/rec/SHYBGT>"
Related to this, and more specifically on Yoga/Bhakti, is:
"Pata?jali?s Yoga: Universal Ethics as the Formal Cause of Autonomy 
<https://philpapers.org/rec/RANPYU-2>"
Hope this helps,? and best wishes,
