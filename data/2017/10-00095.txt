10th Annual Lawrence J. Schoenberg Symposium on Manuscript Studies in the Digital Age

November 2-4, 2017

Intertwined Worlds



In partnership with the Rare Book Department<https://libwww.freelibrary.org/rarebooks/index.cfm> of the Free Library of Philadelphia and the Center for Ancient Studies at UPenn, the Schoenberg Institute of Manuscript Studies (SIMS<http://schoenberginstitute.org/>) at the University of Pennsylvania Libraries is pleased to announce the 10th Annual Lawrence J. Schoenberg Symposium on Manuscript Studies in the Digital Age.

Despite the linguistic and cultural complexity of many regions of the premodern world, religion supplies the basis of a strong material and textual cohesion that both crosses and intertwines boundaries between communities. This year?s theme, ?Intertwined Worlds,? will highlight the confluence of expressions of belief, ritual, and social engagement emerging in technologies and traditions of the world's manuscript cultures, often beyond a single religious context. It will consider common themes and practices of textual, artistic, literary, and iconographic production in religious life across time and geography, from ancient precedents to modern reception and dissemination in the digital age.

This year?s symposium features a keynote address by Phyllis Granoff, Lex Hixon Professor of Religious Studies, Yale University, on ?The Mystery of Mistakes: Reflections on Indian Illustrated Manuscripts,? to be held at the Free Library of Philadelphia at 6pm,on November 2, 2017 (reception beginning at 5pm).
