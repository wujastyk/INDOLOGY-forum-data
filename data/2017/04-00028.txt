Dear Jesse,
There was a special issue of Marg devoted to the GG, published about 20 years or so ago. I have
a copy of it someplace, but it may not be see easy to locate immediately. Also, you are no doubt
aware that Kapila Vatsyayana published several volumes of illustrated manuscripts of the GG. I can
send you some of those references if you do not already have them. The text was popular, too, in Nepal,
and there is at least one well-known Nepali translation, probably more.
I do not know of a complete Tibetan translation, but it is possible that Gendun Chopel (1903-1951)
translated some selections. I will try to look into it.
good luck with this!
