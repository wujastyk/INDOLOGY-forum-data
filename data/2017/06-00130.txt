Nammayya of U,PperaguQem, a hamlet of Amalapuram, In the
GolgoI)Qa taluk of the Vizagapatam district, and received from the
Collector of Vizagapatam in 1896-97 to whom the plates were sent
.. '
by the karnam of Amaillpuram" who secured them, when they were
offered for sale in 1895 by the wife of Nammayya. The plates
are strung on a ring, the ends of which are soldered to a circular
seal bearing: in relief on the countersunk surface a lion.
The inscription is in Sanskrit, though Prakrit words occur now
