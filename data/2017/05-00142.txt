[INDOLOGY] Questioning South Asia Conference
Thank you, too, Howard! These questions are however best addressed to the
organizers of the conference.
I am not involved.
?The word, the phrase "South Asia" was invented in Washington D.C. at the
State Department.?
(Sheldon Pollock).
If "South Asia" ? understood in its geopolitical connotation ? was indeed
instigated by the State Department as part of a conceptual, i.e. artificial
segmentation of Asia into different post-war spheres of influence, in whose
interest should one expect them to pursue such an agenda?
The temporal coincidence with the swift founding of Departments and courses
of university studies, all of a sudden bearing ?South Asia? in their names
like flag-staffs of the new policy is something which might make some
colleagues reflect a little more about the institutional histories of their
subject.
Have a look at this:
