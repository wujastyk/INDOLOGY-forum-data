Just a short note on the ?c?ras: Marjatta Parpola has dealt with the topic extensively in the appendices of her ?Kerala Brahmins in Transition? (Helsinki 2000): She quotes (supplemented with a translation by her husband Asko Parpola) ?a?kara-Sm?ti 1.12.4 with commentaries from Kerala, comments by Logan, Fawcett and Iyer, and a list of Kerala customs according to Gundert.

> While the earlier discussion has been the cultural differences of Kerala brahmins, are there early discussions of the ?c?ras of Kerala non-brahmins, particularly persons outside Kerala? About 50 years ago, I heard an orthodox non-Kerala person say ?Kera?am v?nara ?c?ram?. When I asked him why he said so, he said it was because of the history of polyandry in Kerala and he cited the story of T?r?, the wife of V?lin, as an example of a woman with more than one husband. I do not know the source of that saying. Recently, I came across an article that discusses the Western attitudes towards the status of women in Kerala society.
