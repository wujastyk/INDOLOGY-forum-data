Just a short note on the ?c?ras: Marjatta Parpola has dealt with the topic extensively in the appendices of her ?Kerala Brahmins in Transition? (Helsinki 2000): She quotes (supplemented with a translation by her husband Asko Parpola) ?a?kara-Sm?ti 1.12.4 with commentaries from Kerala, comments by Logan, Fawcett and Iyer, and a list of Kerala customs according to Gundert.
