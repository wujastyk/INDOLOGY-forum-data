[INDOLOGY] pravesha
Greetings All,
?
I?ve been thinking about the many uses of the Skt. term pravesha (entrance) throughoutSouth Asian textual and performative traditions: Vedic rituals, possessionevents, royal festivals, etc. I haven?t found much that has been written onthis term specifically, and I?m wondering what happens if we treat it as a ?criticalterm? in South Asian religions like bhakti,karma, dharma, etc.
?
I would be most appreciative for any primary or secondarysources on pravesha and/or any otherexamples where this term ? or allied terms (pratishta)? occur. Many thanks in advance, and apologies for cross-posting.
