The evidence in V?caspati-mi?ra?s works suggests that he must have had ?aiva leanings. Cf. p. of my 2001 article ?The prologue and epilogue verses of V?caspati-mi?ra-I." Rivista degli Studi Orientali 73: 105-130.

Since the journal in which the article was published may not be easily accessible and since the article contains many other observations relevant to the history of Advaita Ved?nta, Ny?ya, etc., I attach a copy of it here. 



Perhaps it would be relevant to note in this context that there were two great scholars named V?caspati-mi?ra who were separated from each other by about five centuries. See Aklujkar, Ashok. 1998. "V?caspati-mi?ra's Tattva-samik?? and the last two verses in Yukti-d^pik? manuscripts." Adyar Library Bulletin 62: 125-165.
