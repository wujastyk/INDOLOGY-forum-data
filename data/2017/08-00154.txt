The name of this river is reminding of 'K?yal', the name of the emporium in the delta of the Tamraparni (Tinnevelly District) referred to by Marco Polo (https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/p/polo/marco/travels/book3.21.html - cf. K?lkhoi emporion, Ptolemy Geogr. 7, 1, 10). But the Tamil word k?yal ('backwater, mouth of a stream") is far from the meaning of "Curve of the body" (ku?? is found in several words for/names of "curving" rivers). The T?mrapar??  herself is described by K?lid?sa in 4.50 (53  crit. ed. Goodall & Isaacson).
This explanation of N?ga(/Uraga)-pura as a city on the border of the K?yaku??  river in the  P???ya country was already made by  Dak?i??vartan?tha  (13th-14th c.) in his unpublished d?pik? on the Raghuva??a according to N. P. Unni (Highways and Byways in Sanskrit Literature, Delhi: New Bharatiya Book Corporation, 2012, p. 159, who relies on a KUML transcript-manuscript). It is in this case (like in other) the source of  Aru?agirin?tha (contemporary of  Mallin?tha, early 15th century - the latter who also sometimes uses Dak?i??vartan?tha has possibly misread his source here or, as you guess, his text has been later corrupted), himself followed by  N?r?ya?a Pa??ita.
The commentary of Vallabhadeva could be useful here, but I have not Goodall & Isaacson edition at hand.
On his side, the commentator Hem?dri says: urag?khyasyeti kalpit?rtham.
