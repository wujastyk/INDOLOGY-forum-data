[INDOLOGY] Once again on the origin of zero: the date of the Bakhshali manuscript (or manuscripts?)
Here attached, for the non specialists of the topic, a copy of Rudolf Hoernle's (1882) 1883 report and 1888 article issued in the Indian Antiquary, really interesting to read (like the rest of this discussion).
Best wishes,
Christophe Vielle
