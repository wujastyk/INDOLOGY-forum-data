Hi Dominik,

      I realized that the version of Yashomudra font that I was having
trouble on my Mac was a 2013 older version.  The 2015 version installed
without any problems.  I like this font a lot, though I see that the
alignment of signs like "?", "?", "?" etc. with the vertical stems of the
Devanagari characters is not as good as in Sanskrit 2003.  What I like
about Yashomudra is the variable length of the sign for short "i" depending
upon the width of the consonant sign and consonant clusters.  This is
something I do not see in Sanskrit 2003.  I had worked on this feature in
my old Chi-Writer Devanagari fonts in 1980s, which no longer work on newer
computer systems.  I hope that the new version of Sanskrit 2003 that Vikram
Bhaskaran's team is working on will deal with some of these issues.  I
would be happy to do font testing for this team.

Madhav
