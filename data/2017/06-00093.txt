[INDOLOGY] WSC2018
Bonjour,
In April, I could see a message about the World Sanskrit Conference
2018, I went to the main site for this conference
https://wsc.ubcsanskrit.ca/ and tried to subscribe to the mailing list.
No answer up to now.
I tried to contact wsc2018 at ubcsanskrit.ca in order to get some news.
Today I received an automatic reply:
