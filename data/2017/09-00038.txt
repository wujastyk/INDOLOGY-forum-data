Dear all
I am constantly searching for the commentary of ??????????????????
by Kr?sn?a??na?tha nya?yapan?ca?nana. No luck till date.
If any one finds the book even in any library kindly let me know.
 This book must have published from Calcutta 1880s. There is in an entry in
Bibliography of Indian Philosophy.

He has not only written on Nyayaprakasa but also on Arthasangraha which is
very lucid, Vedantaparibhasa and also on Champu Ramayana Abhijnana
Shakuntala etc.

Thanks
