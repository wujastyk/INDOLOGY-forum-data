[INDOLOGY] Gita 13.6
Scholar,&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The best way to comprehend Avykta or "The unmanifested"is available in Gita&nbsp;itself.2.26(or may be 27,)says- A chheddyam,Adahhyam,Akleddya,Ashoshya eba cha ,Nitya Sarvagata Sthanu Chalayam ,Sanatana........Avyaktayam,Achintyam,Avikaryam ucchyate.The concept of Avyakta in our Philosophy is dimensionless,although itis the sole EXISTENCE. The fact that it is dimensionless, can be accessed from this Upanishadic qoute- Ananu,Asthulam,Arhasham,A..dirgham....etc.," Avyaktam' is the Sumnum Bonum of our Vedanta Philosophy.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Alakendu Ds

[INDOLOGY] Gita 13.6
Dear Scholars,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would appreciate insights on how we might understand the use of ?avyakta,? the ?unmanifest? in the Gita 13.6 and elsewhere as a type of element or dimension of this world.
Thanks,
Howard
