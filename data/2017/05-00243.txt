Dear Friends, Does anyone have a soft copy of Banerjee's ed. of the
Saduktikar??m?ta? In a morbid joke of fate, my own copy is so ??????? that
it is falling apart in my hands as I reread the sections on poverty
(describing people's houses falling apart, etc.). I am getting ready to go
on the road and don't think it can handle the journey.
????????? ?????, ??????, ??
