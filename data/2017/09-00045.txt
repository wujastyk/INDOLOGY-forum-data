Dear Christophe,
Here are some further thoughts related to the place of Dak?i??vartan?tha. If he calls it ?Mah?rjuna', one should not equate it with Madhy?rjuna or Tiruvi?aimarut?r. We should look for a place called Perumarut?r. Today, you will find many Marut?rs in Tamil Nadu. There is a Perumarut?r in Pudukkottai District (https://www.google.com/maps/@10.0792648,79.1085514,15.95z <https://www.google.com/maps/@10.0792648,79.1085514,15.95z>). But there are no inscriptional records supporting this location as a settlement of Brahmins of high achievement.
However, we have another Perumarut?r mentioned in inscriptions from the 7th century. The I?aiy??putt?r copper plates (?va?am 18, p.10) mention a Perumarut?r, a village on the bank of the K?viri river where Vedic Brahmins lived. The objective of the grant was to give a Brahmin from this village a Brahmadeya village called I?aiy??putt?r in K?vilpa??i-Ca?kara?k?vil region of today. R. Nagaswamy has discussed this inscription in http://tamilartsacademy.com/articles/article54.xml <http://tamilartsacademy.com/articles/article54.xml>.
Later medieval inscriptions also mention persons from Perumarut?r as living in different villages. SII 12, no. 184 refers to a Brahmin from Perumarut?r living in Ulaka?antac??accaturvetima?kalam identified with Om?mpuliyur near Chidambaram. (The inscription also refers to a Tiruvala?cu?i U?aiy?r Iccippe??arayar of A?icupakkam. Interestingly Tiruvala?cu?i U?aiy?r is the Tamil equivalent of Dak?i??vartan?tha (except for the prefix Tiru-) and he is supposedly from A?icup?kkam.) Karantai Plates mention a 
According to SII 2, no. 70, p. 332, Perumarut?r (Perumarud?r) was in the K??Pal??u subdivision of P?cci? K???am of R?j??raya Va?an??u. Karandai Plates of 1021 mention a Brahmin from the same village receiving a share of the grant. Karandai Plates also mention another Brahmin from Perumarut?r but living in a different village. SII 26, no. 729 of 1219-20 CE in Tirune?u?ka?am in Tiruchi district mentions a Ma??aiy??v?? Vetan?yakapa??an (Vedan?yakabha??a) of K??yapa gotra from Perumarut?r. Inscription SII 26, no. 140 of 1411 CE in Komaralingam in Coimbatore district mentions a Brahmin from Perumarut?r who acted as a representative of the Vijayanagara king.
According to K. G. Krishnan, the editor of Karandai Plates of 1021 CE, this village was located either in Lalgudi or Musiri Taluk of Tiruchirappalli district. There is a village called Ci?umarut?r/Sirmarudhur (Little Marut?r) to the west of Lalgudi. (https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sirumarudhur,+Tamil+Nadu+621218,+India/@10.8824954,78.7518197,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x3baaf14646fb8353:0xb6c72eac7121f4!8m2!3d10.8819984!4d78.7603726 <https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sirumarudhur,+Tamil+Nadu+621218,+India/@10.8824954,78.7518197,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x3baaf14646fb8353:0xb6c72eac7121f4!8m2!3d10.8819984!4d78.7603726>) To the north of Ci?umarut?r is a village called Marut?r. I do not know if this was the Perumarut?r (contrasting with the Little Marut?r) mentioned in the inscriptions. 
Whatever be its current exact location is, I propose this Perumarut?r near Tiruchrappalli to be the Tamil equivalent of ?Mah?rjuna' of Dak?i??vartan?tha.
