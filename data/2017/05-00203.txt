Dear Olle,
While this does not amount to "bio-data," I assume that Bhadrinath Sastri is
the same person as Bhadrinath Sukla, the author of a remarkable multi-volume
Hindi trans/commentary on the Sastra-varta-samuccaya of Haribhadra together with
the Syadvada-kalpalata of Yasovijayagani (pub. Divya-darsan Trust, Vikrama samvat 2040).
(This is available through the Jain elibrary, by the way.)
Sorry for the absence of diacritical marks.
best,
Matthew
