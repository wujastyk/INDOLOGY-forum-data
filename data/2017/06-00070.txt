[INDOLOGY] A new Sanskrit Reader
Dear Dr. Ruppel,
Congratulations on your contract, and thanks for undertaking such a 
useful project.  I am retired from teaching, but I applaud this project 
nonetheless.
My principal suggestion is to include, perhaps toward the end of the 
reader, samples of commentarial literature.  Vy?kara?a and dharma??stra 
are good fishing ponds for such texts, but the field matters less than 
providing the learner with samples of commentarial style.
With all best wishes,
Rosane Rocher
