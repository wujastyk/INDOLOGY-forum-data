Dear colleagues,
I?m trying to trace Raghunandana Bha???c?ryya?s Tithitattva. So far no success. I found on DLI the second volume of his Smr?titattva (edited by J?v?nanda Vidy?s?gara) (Kalik?t?: Siddhe?vara Press, 1865). Does anybody know whether the first volume (which includes, amongst the others, Tithitattva) is available in a digital format as well? If so, I?d be very thankful if you could point me in the right direction or, even better, if you had one copy to share.
With many thanks
Fabrizio
