Subject: [INDOLOGY] Methods to solve superiority problems, such as the contest among the vital functions
Message-ID: <8cce63cd-8317-dd4c-53d3-b43ff930ee0b@wifa.uni-leipzig.de>

Dear list members,

the contest among vital functions is a well-known topic in the ?ra?yakas 
and the Upani?ads. Among other arguments one finds two generalizable 
solutions to the superiority problem: (i) the sequential approach and, 
(ii), the withdrawal approach. (i) In KauU 2.14, the vital functions 
enter the body (which does not stand) one after another. Only when 
breath enters, the body gets up. (ii) In B?U 6.1, ChU 5.1, and ?? 9.1-7, 
speech leaves the body and reenters after a while. Etc.

Is anyone of you aware of any non-modern Indian or non-Indian solutions 
to the superiority problem that proceed along similar generalizable lines?

Yours sincerely
