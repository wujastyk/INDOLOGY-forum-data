Dear All,
Has anyone come across ??kh?v?k?avat sam?sa? as an explanation for a
Sanskrit compound? I have encountered it in Dak?i??vartan?tha's commentary
ad Meghad?ta 76 (2.16/19 etc.) to explain ?i?j?-valaya- :
?i?j? ?i?jita?; ?i?j?vanti valay?ni ?i?j?valay?ni | ??kh?v?k?avat sam?sa?.
The elision of a possessive suffix (matublopa) is known from the
Mah?bh??ya, but I am not familiar with the example ??kh?v?k?a.  Please
reply on-list so that everyone may benefit from the exchange.
Many thanks in advance.
