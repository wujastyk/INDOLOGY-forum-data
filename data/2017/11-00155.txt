Apologies for crossposting, but this is probably of interest to many in the
list.

The Buddhist Digital Resource Center (formerly Tibetan Buddhist Resource
Center) has released a mobile app for both iOS and Android. Right now, only
Tibetan materials are available, but Sanskrit, Pali, Chinese, and other
language materials will come. Pasted info below:

The mobile app makes it possible to access texts from BDRC?s library with a
few taps on a mobile touchscreen, whether the user is in a remote area or a
major city.

BDRC?s Library on iOS and Android

The BDRC App is available on iOS and Android operating systems. Please
visit the storefront on the App Store and on Google Play for more
information and to download the app for use on your mobile device. Users
