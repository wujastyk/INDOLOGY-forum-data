"We may find the reference of six headed Siva (Bhadresvara) from the
inscription of Champa (Myson stone slab inscription of Jaya Indravarman II,
dated 1088 AD)."
Chitra paada issue is yet to be resolved.
I found through web search some Kauai's Hindu Monastery using the word
Chitra Pada puja.
But they use word Chitra Puja also. So it doesn't seem to be Chitrapaada
+pooja but it seems to be Chitrapooja +paadapooja = chitrapaadapooja.
