Dear Martin and friends,

Some time back, I uploaded the volumes of the *Ayurvediya Sabdakosa* by
Josi and Josi to archive.org.  These volumes are a precious resource for
ayurvedic vocab.  "*Agnidagdha*" and "*agnid?ha*" are on v.1, page five
<https://archive.org/stream/AyurvediyaSabdakosa1968/Ayurvediya%20Sabdakosa-v1_1968#page/n25/mode/1up>,
with clear meanings and some references.

I recommend these volumes to everyone for checking out puzzling ayurvedic
words.

Best,
Dominik
