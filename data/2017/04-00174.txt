=?utf-8?Q?Re:_[INDOLOGY]_Renou,_=C3=89coles?=
Dear Arlo, Hans, and Asko,
I don't have a pdf of this book, but I have photocopy of it [I copied it
when I was a graduate student, long before the days of pdfs].  If a pdf
does not emerge soon, I will get one of the local computer shops to convert
it into a pdf.
Best wishes,
George
