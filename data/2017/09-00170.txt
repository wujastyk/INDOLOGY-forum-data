Another minor addition. Her colleagues and students in Ahmedabad are  
now preparing a commemoration volume. Presumably some biographical  
materials will become available there.
She is survived by her nephew (Aviv) and niece (Rina) who keep her  
unpublished papers.
As you probably know, her translation of the Tattvopaplavasimha was  
published posthumously by her student Suchita Mehta.
Best wishes,
Eli
