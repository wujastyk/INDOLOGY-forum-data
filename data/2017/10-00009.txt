=?utf-8?Q?Re:_[INDOLOGY]_Agnid=C4=81ha?=
Many thanks to Roland Steiner and Lubom?r Ondra?ka for pointing out that 
B?htlingk's later /Sanskrit-W?rterbuch in k?rzerer Fassung /in fact 
gives 'Brandwunde' as the meaning of agnid?ha, rather than the name of a 
disease. This was how I had first understood the word, before I happened 
upon the MW entry.
