[INDOLOGY] Was A?oka an iconoclast?
Matsyapurana's discussion on temple architecture and installation and
placing of sculptures or icons in various portions of the temple and many
other such related matters is also relevant here.
Of course, dating of the book is another issue tied up to this. But it
certainly is older than Gupta -Udayagiri date.
