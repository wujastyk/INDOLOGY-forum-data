Before further random guessing, I suggest to consult the evidence Michael
Witzel has collected and the reasons he has put forward in his paper:
*Y?j?avalkya
as ritualist and philosopher, and his personal language"* (*Paitim?na.
Essays in Iranian, Indo-European, and Indian Studies in Honor of
Hanns-Peter Schmidt*, hg. v. Siamak Adhami. Vol. I: Indo-European and
Indian Studies, Costa Mesa 2003, S. 103-143.), see, in particular, there on
pp. 135f and 138.
