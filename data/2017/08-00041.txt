[INDOLOGY] sex and gender
Dear all,
This is a question from a colleague who is not on the list. This 
colleague teaches a course on Sex and Gender theory and is interested in 
articles that addresses the topic from differing cultural vantages. I 
was asked about what was available on the topic that discusses the issue 
from the perspective of the Indian tradition.  I didn't know what to 
say. I'd be grateful for any suggestions.
Thanks,
Shyam
