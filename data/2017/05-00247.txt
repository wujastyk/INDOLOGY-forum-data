Subject: [INDOLOGY] Maraharaja's College Magazine, Vizianagaram, vol. I (1922)

Colleagues,


I am looking for an article by K.V. Lakshmana Rao on a pair of copper-plate inscriptions found at Kanteru, published in one of the 1922 issues of the Maraharaja's College Magazine, Vizianagaram. Judging from the pdfs of vol. II available on archive.org (https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.382562, https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.490266 ? both apparently for the same contents, both times wrongly labeled) the issues for 1922 formed volume I.


I am unable to access the DLI source pages for the above pdfs, and hence unable to see if I can get at the volume that I need. Would any one with greater DLI experience that I have, or with access to an exceptional research library that holds a physical copy of the Maraharaja's College Magazine, Vizianagaram, vol. I (1922), be able to help me obtain the article I need?


Thank you.


Arlo Griffiths
