Dear Madhav,

unless the Maharastrian ?Saint? Tuka(Ram) is a clue, Pippala-grama- derived
names also occur in Orissa (Pipli when Paippaladin Atharvavedins indeed
exist: I talk to them in 1983) and in U.P.

Similarly for Kumbha/Nikumbha that occur, if memory serves, in the Nilamata
Purana of Kashmir and in the Devi Mahatmya: All clearly mythological?(next
to Pi??cas etc,)
Is the change from bh > b a Maharastrian trait? I doubt. But typical for
Dardic languages, including Kashmiri.

Just my 2 cents.
Michael

replies! There was a discussion on the list about two years ago concerning
the name Tuka itself, which also seemed likely to be of Marathi origin. I
am still wondering about the 'one great king' of the Nikumbhas, which does
sound as though the author had a particular ruler in mind. It needn't have
been a contemporary king, of course -- it might be someone associated
historically with the founding of Pippalagr?ma.
