[INDOLOGY] Fwd: Re: help on a citation
Hello Fran?ois,
As I understand, the commentary is trying to account for the expression
"mi?rau glau".  If we understand the expression "g-l" as a dvandva
compound, then the dual affix "au" could be interpreted as relating to each
member of the dvandva compound, and this can allow the compound to refer to
groups like "g-g" and "l-l" as well.  These units are referred to by the
commentary with the word mi?ra.
There is a commonly repeated convention (ny?ya): dvandv?t para? ?r?yam??a?
?abda? pratyekamabhisambadhyate.  Another wording found elsewhere is:
dvandv?nte ?r?yam??a? pada? pratyekam abhisambadhyate.
