In P?li literature:
J?taka 186 (Dadhiv?hanaj?taka) A mango seed (?bone?) is planted in royal garden and watered with milk water and in the third year it yielded fruit. Now it was given all care: watering it with milk water, giving it auspicious wreaths, throwing garlands around it, lighting it by burning fragrant oil and putting a shroud around it. It?s fruits were sweet and golden yellow. When the king sent a fruit to other kings, he let pierce with a ma??u prickle the part of the seed where the sprout starts, and thus they could not grow new mangos. In order to make the fruits bitter, the wicked gardener planted nimba trees and paggava creepers around it and eventually the fruits went bitter. To correct it the king let all nimbas and paggavas to be removed and also the bitter earth to be removed, put on sweet earth instead and let the tree be watered with milk water, sugar water and fragrant waters. Thus it became sweet again. 
Vim?navatthu 6, 3 (67) Commentary: King Bimbis?ra wanted mangoes out of due season. By forced measures, his gardener produced four, but, seeing Mah?-Moggall?na, gave them as alms. The king accepted this and gave him a reward.
