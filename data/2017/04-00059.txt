[INDOLOGY] question about mixed oral/manuscript transmission
book that talks about it?
transmitted on the one hand in a written form (copies of manuscript in
manuscript), on the other hand Without written support (a scribe not
writing a text that he knows by heart)?
This dual transmission has been there for all the traditional orally
transmitted texts of Vedas and Veda-related Shastras.
Prof. Blackburn's focus in his villupp???u analysis, particularly on the
orality and literacy aspects, is on the influence of the written text on
the oral performance, particularly on the 'control' of the written text on
the oral performance of villupp???u.
The conventional idea in modern studies that non-Sanskrit regional language
orally transmitted, particularly 'folk' texts did not have their parallel
written versions. Right from the time of study of villupp???u by Prof.
Blackburn, parallel written transmission of 'folk' 'oral' texts in regional
Indian languages is being paid attention to.
