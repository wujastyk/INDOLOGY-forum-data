[INDOLOGY] Kshut(a)
In the V?ddhayavanaj?taka, k?ut/k?uta has five occurrences. Two are found in Ch.67 on mi?rik?dhy?ya? (miscellaneous omens) which I translated recently.
67.12ab v?m??gakampo g?habha?gak?r? k?uta? svapak??d bhayam ?tanoti/
67.12cd yuddha? nar???? prakaroti yuddha? ruta? rutenaiva samanvita? ca//
"The trembling of the left limbs would cause the house to break. Sneezing would cause fear resulted from one?s allies. Quarrels and cries [of animals] accompanied [by nothing but] just cries would cause quarrels among men.?
67.25ab chardi jvaro ve??ajanasya n??a? y?ne vidhatte sukhasaukhyah?nim/
67.25cd ani??al?bha? prakaroty ari??a? gosa?k?uta? pr??ahara? hi y?tu?//
"Vomiting or fever (chardi[s]+jvara?) would bring about the loss (n??a? < n?so) of a loved one and the destruction of happiness and good fortune during the expedition. Getting an evil omen (ani??al?bha?) would result in untimely death (ari?ta? < ani??am). Sneezing of cows [would result in] the death of the traveler."
The edition is not entirely satisfactory, nor is my translation. The k?uta? in 67.12 does however seem to suggest a bodily action, hence, sneezing. I am now not so certain about the gosa?k?uta? in 67.25 now that you raised some doubts concerning the etymology of k?ut. But maybe cows do sneeze after all!
