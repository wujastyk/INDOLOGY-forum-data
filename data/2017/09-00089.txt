Dear Andrey,
Nowadays it is also worth consulting Panditproject.org for prosopographical
queries such as yours.  There is an entry on Vaidyan?tha Tatsat
<http://www.panditproject.org/entity/86309/person>, with some
bibliography.  This may or may not provide information new to you, but as a
resource it is growing rapidly.  And you may sign up and make your own
contributions.
Best,
Dominik
