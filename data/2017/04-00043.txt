The passage begins: "The question of writing in the R?m?ua?a has been extensively discussed, especially with regard to its bearing on the date of the poem.  There are in fact very few references in the text but these are all to marking objects with a name, [refs in fn.] not to the use of writing for extended documents of whatever type.  The better known are the two mentions of the ring marked with his own name which R?ma gives to Hanum?n as a token for S?t? (4.43.11 and 5.34.2)."
