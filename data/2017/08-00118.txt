Dear list members,

I am writing in order to have an elucidation about the dating of the  Prapann?m?ta by Anant?c?rya; I have found a reference on the web which locates this text and its author during the XVII century CE, but without any kind of explanation. On the contrary, I noticed that some scholars placed this hagiography in the XI century, very close to the life of R?m?nuja; I am reading at the moment a passage collocated in Vijayanagara (adhy?ya 123) related to the emperor Vir?p?k?a II (1465-1485). I think that dating the text to the XI century would be not so pertinent?
Could you kindly give me suggestions (about the dating or some studies/articles related to the topic)?
Many thanks in advance.
My best regards,


David Pierdominici
