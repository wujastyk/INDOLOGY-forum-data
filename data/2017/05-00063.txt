[INDOLOGY] Buddhasrijnana's Abhisamaya commentary
Dear Birgit,
Thank you for your valuable notes. Perhaps I should've written a follow-up
email to this in good time.
My friend Kazuo Kano came to the rescue -- and this is certainly not the
first time! Apparently the plates were passed on to Wogihara, and later
ended up with Kendai Eno'u (if this is the right spelling), who published
it in 1973. Nagao wrote a review in 1976.
The text is indeed called Praj??prad?p?val? (actually, this is only a part,
the 8th chapter), just like its Tibetan translation, which is attributed to
J??nap?da, but these are two very different texts!
At first I thought that this must be the 'other' Buddha?r?j??na, who worked
among the Gnubs, but then I started seeing quite exact parallels in
Abhay?karagupta's Munimat?la?k?ra (and therefore in Da?abala?r?mitra's
Sa?sk?t?sa?sk?tavini?caya). I'm still not quite sure, but chances are that
this could be (a bit of) one of J??nap?da's juvenilia, composed after his
study with Haribhadra (whose influence is undeniable), when he was at
N?land?, before his (first) trip to the Konkan.
Is Mer? j?van y?tr? online by any chance? It would be wonderful to read it,
not only for 'our' interests, but also because it's considered, if I
understand correctly, the foundation of the Hindi travelogue.
Many thanks once again.
Yours,
Peter
