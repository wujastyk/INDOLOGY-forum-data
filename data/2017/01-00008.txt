[INDOLOGY] a question regarding the usage of -gotra versus -sagotra
Dear colleagues,
     I am forwarding a question from a friend of mine, for which I do not
have a clear answer:

Dear Madhav,
I thought you might have a quick answer to this question. When mentioning
gotras, one sees "Visv?mitra gotra", but also "?treyasa gotra", and
"K?syapasa gotra".
Since the ??is in the two latter cases are Atri and Kasyapa, it would
appear that the corresponding gotras should be "?treya" and "K?syapa",
without the "sa" suffix. (Indeed, one also sees "?treya gotra", and
"K?syapa gotra".)
Is it the case that the correct terms are "?treya sagotra", and "K?syapa
sagotra", and the conventional usage is simply an incorrect parsing?
However, this would require "Visv?mitra sagotra", which one does not see.
Or is there something more to it than that?

Why would someone be referred to as Vi?v?mitra-gotra, but others as
?treya-sagotra or K??yapa-sagotra?  I will appreciate a clarification.
