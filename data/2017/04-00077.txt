Dear Dominik,
     This kind of double meaning of the word ka??ya is also seen in the
Buddhist usage of the word kas?va/k?s?va.  For example, in the Pali verse
(Dhammapada 1.9) "anikkas?vo k?s?va? yo vattham paridahessati / apeto
damasaccena na so k?s?vam arahati //" (One not free from defilements, who
dons a yellow robe, that one devoid of control and truth, is not worthy of
a yellow robe."  Here, there is a pun on the words kas?va/k?s?va, and it
shows the use of the word in the sense of a color of defilements as well as
the color of the Buddhist robe.
