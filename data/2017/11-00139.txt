[INDOLOGY] Dastur Komwar at Rajasthan State Archives, Bikaner
Dear colleagues,
Does anyone have experience in accessing documents in the Rajasthan 
State Archives in Bikaner from afar? It appears that they have all been 
digitized, but there are conflicting reports online as to their 
availability. It is not possible to register at the state archives 
website without an Indian mobile number, and they are not responding to 
my emails.
I am looking for 1 folio in particular: Dastur Komwar, Vol. 25, VS 1857, 
f. 138.
Any help or suggestions would be most appreciated.
Regards,
Jacob
