Message-ID: <CALNcvFsFwKjdMCtWLHH4Wj9NgomKLfXp30beOnqhtKNz_vCG5g@mail.gmail.com>

Dear List,

Is there any work on coincidental (accidental, pure chance) happenings and
their role - as stimuli - in the process of the formation of the
traditional Indian social structure --- as portrayed in the Epic and
post-Epic literature?

Best,

Artur Karp (em.)
