Dear Friends, One of my students is partially visually impaired and doing
some Bhagavadg?t? self-study over the summer. I gave him a very good scan
of the critical ed, but he's finding the font too grainy when he magnifies
it. With this in mind, does anyone know of a very well-printed--especially
one with large and bold script--ed of the G?t?? Thanks,J
