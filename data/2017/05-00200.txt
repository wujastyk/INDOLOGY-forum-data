Dear Olle,
Some time ago I scanned and uploaded this text here:
http://www.downloads.prajnaquest.fr/BookofDzyan/Sanskrit%20Hindu%20Texts/kiranavali_prakasa_didhiti_1932.pdf
.
Other related texts may be found at the same location.
I do not know if this text is available at the Digital Library of India,
but in any case my scan may be better resolution.
I do not have any bio-data on Badrinath Sastri.
Best regards,
David Reigle
