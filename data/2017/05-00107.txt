A hard copy of Helen Johnson?s translation of the
Tri?a??i?al?k?puru?acaritra is available in an edited reprint under the
title, *The Jain Saga: Brief History of Jainism* (Ahmedabad: Acharyadev
Shrimad Vijay Ramchandra Suriswarji Jain Pathashala, [2009]). All six
volumes of the original translation are here included in three compact
volumes, two in each. Helen Johnson?s translation was here slightly edited
by Muni Samvegayashvijay Maharaj, who highly praised it in his preface.
Diacritics were omitted in this re-typeset reprint. This reprint is also
said to be available in soft copy at the publisher?s website:
www.jaine.org/jainsaga. However, this address does not work, at least from
my computer.
The hard copy is at present available from a seller in India through Amazon
for $45.00:
https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/8190815709/ref=nosim/addallcom-20.
It is also available from Biblia Impex in India:
