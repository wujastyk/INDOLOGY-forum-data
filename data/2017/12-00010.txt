[INDOLOGY] Avadhanam question
Reply from the famous Living Legend ???????? Dr R Ganesh -
Namaskaara,
I have already done my  research and published my voluminous D. Litt.,
thesis on this before twenty years and the book has been revised and
enlarged in the second edition as well. Shortly my exhaustive  English book
on this is going to be published. I have considered, compiled and analysed
firsthand original sources of avadhaana in all languages, where it is
practiced, directly and have given a detailed treatment with profuse
examples as well. Here my thirty seven years of direct experience as an
avadhaani having performed more than thousand avadhaana-s in various
languages with very many designs a challenges have been utilized to forge
authenticity into the findings and I have also consulted many illustrious
avadhaani-s to get a bigger picture. Hope this would answer all inquiries
of the seekers.
Regards
Ganesh
