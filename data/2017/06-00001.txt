Dear list members,
I am looking for the Introduction of this book:
Carl Gustav Jung and K?roly Ker?nyi (eds) 1942. *Einf?hrung in das Wesen
der Mythologie*.
I already have an Italian trans. of this pubblication, but I need of an
English trans.
More specifically, I need of a short passage in the first essay
(Introduction), written by K. Ker?nyi, where "mythologem" is defined.
Best,
Paolo
