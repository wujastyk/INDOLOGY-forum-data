Donation of Monier-Williams?archive
 by gillian.evison   |

  


The Bodleian owes much of its rich collection of Indic manuscripts and books to the personal collection of?Oxford University's?Boden Professor of Sanskrit, Sir Monier Monier-Williams and that of?the Indian Institute Library, which he founded in 1883. Scholars have long assumed that the library also holds Sir Monier's papers: these, however,?remained with?his family.



Sir Monier-Williams' great great grandson?has now most generously donated?these papers to the library.? This?archival collection?includes?diaries, material on the controversial election of Sir Monier to the Boden Professorship,?his lecture notes and scrapbooks of newspaper clippings, all of which provide?new insights into his career and the history of Indian Studies at Oxford.
