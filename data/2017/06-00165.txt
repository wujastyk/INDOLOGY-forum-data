oh, good!

I got the fonts yesterday, so I had no error messages like that.

Chi-Writer! Wow! I haven't thought of that for many years!  I remember now,
it was a very important tool for a period.

What a rich eco-system we work in now, by comparison.  Unicode has made
such a difference.

Best,
Dominik
