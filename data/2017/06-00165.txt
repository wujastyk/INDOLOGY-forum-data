[INDOLOGY] More Devanagari font samples
oh, good!
I got the fonts yesterday, so I had no error messages like that.
Chi-Writer! Wow! I haven't thought of that for many years!  I remember now,
it was a very important tool for a period.
What a rich eco-system we work in now, by comparison.  Unicode has made
such a difference.
Best,
Dominik
