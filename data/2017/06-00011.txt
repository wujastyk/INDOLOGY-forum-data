Street magic performers, spell healers and other such practicing groups are
not water tight compartments. There is a big section of this type of
illusion art-supernatural practitioners who are muslims. All those who
studied these cultures through direct close observation know that Muslims
among these use 'Hindu' deity names, 'Hindu' occult material and pooja
material like Turmeric and Kumkum powders etc. Their 'clients call using
them names such as Swami, Jogi etc. also alongside names such as Baba etc.

The spell you quoted belongs to this kind of cultural complex where Islamic
Jogi is common place, not strange and not at all contradictio in adiecto.

.............................

I do not know the language used in the spell to the level of being able to
give word for word meaning to it.

Some movement after five years of your waiting ?
