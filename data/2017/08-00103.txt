[INDOLOGY] Starting a new academic journal
Dear Ashok, The OLH website is mainly concerned with this question.  The
information begins here
<https://www.openlibhums.org/site/about/the-olh-model/>.  The general idea
is that libraries and scholarly charities pay the OLH to produce OA
journals.  It's cheaper than the libraries having to buy commercial journal
licenses.  Plus, the research paid for by the taxpayer is freely available
to the taxpayer.
Best,
Dominik
