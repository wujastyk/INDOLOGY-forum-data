[INDOLOGY] Warder Sanskrit Reader
Dear all,
I have a full set of A. K. Warder's *Sanskrit Prose Reader*, three volumes,
that I got from a used book dealer some years ago. If Antonia's request to
the University of Toronto library fails, I will join Antonio in scanning
these volumes and making them available. Volume 1 is selections in roman
script (typewriter), volume 2 is selections in devanagari script
(typewriter), and volume 3 is vocabulary.
Best regards,
David Reigle
