Thanks Patrick-ji, for your detailed response(s).
 What an interesting way of defining 'suspension of judgement',
'privileging the emic perspective' !
suspending judgement means not having an argument with someone who has
taken the time to answer my questions; while privileging their perspective
means including it in my narrative.
