Dear Colleagues,
Would anybody be able to provide copies of the following:
Michael Witzel, "The Case of the Shattered Head",? in /Festschrift f?r 
W. Rau/, (= /Studien zur Indologie und Iranistik/ 13/14), Reinbek 1987, 
pp.363- 415
Stanley Insler, "The Shattered Head Split and the Epic tale of 
?akuntal?", /Bulletin d?Etudes Indiennes/ 7-8 (1989-90), pp. 97-139
My attempts to procure them through the usual means have been so far 
unsuccessful.
