Subject: [INDOLOGY] Shattered heads
Message-ID: <e75d42ab-058c-c202-0d78-dd0ea952a054@unicatt.it>

Dear Colleagues,

Would anybody be able to provide copies of the following:

Michael Witzel, "The Case of the Shattered Head",? in /Festschrift f?r 
W. Rau/, (= /Studien zur Indologie und Iranistik/ 13/14), Reinbek 1987, 
pp.363- 415
Stanley Insler, "The Shattered Head Split and the Epic tale of 
?akuntal?", /Bulletin d?Etudes Indiennes/ 7-8 (1989-90), pp. 97-139

My attempts to procure them through the usual means have been so far 
unsuccessful.

Paolo Magnone
