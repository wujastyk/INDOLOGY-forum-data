There is a K?yaku??/"Kayakudi" river in Tamil Nadu, more precisely in the Pandya country. See:
The imperial gazetteer of India, W.W. Hunter, vol. 1, 1885, p. 12:

"Achamthavilthan" ,  means "the lord has removed the fear from the minds of the people".  There is a small story behind this.
There is a river in between the two parts of the village.  People have to go to other side of the river to buy Vegetables and other items. Once a pragrent lady has gone to other side to buy some items. On return, due to sudden rainfall there was a heavy water in the river and she has prayed to the Lord Venkatesa Perumal and he made the way for her. Due to this the people of this village has changed the name as "Achamthavilthan".
11km from there, the same  river (a tributary of the Vaippar river/stream, which flows between the Vangai and the Tamraparni) is also linked to the Madavar Vilagam Vaidyanathar temple in Srivilliputhur (now Virudhunagar District):

The lord also said that as the spring healed her wounds and quenched her thirst, the stream would be known as Kayakudi Aaru.  Those having a dip in the river would be free of all fears of life and attain all comforts in life.
This should be the river to which refers the South-Indian commentator Dak?i??vartan?tha (who himself originated from some village called Mah?rjuna, identified with the "region called Madhy?rjuna which is the Sanskritised form of the popular name of Tiruvi?aimarutt?r" [Thiruvidaimaruthur] near Kumbakonam, according to N. P. Unni).
Why Dak?i??vartan?tha says that [the supposed Pandyan capital] N?gapuram is on the border of this river? Maybe because at the time of the late Pandyas (from the second third of the 14th c. onwards, after the establishment of the Sultanate of Madurai), their real capital was no longer in Madurai (even if they never stopped in their inscriptions to symbolically present themselves as the true rulers of Madurai); "they found themselves restricted to their more southern possessions" (K.A. Nilakanta Sastri, The Pandyan Kingdom, 1929, p. 217) in the regions of Srivilliputur, Tenkasi and Tirunelveli.
I am not sure that more historical importance has to be ascribed to this possibly "new" location of N?gapura by Dak?i??vartan?tha, who is a rather fanciful commentator.
