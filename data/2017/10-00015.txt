Thanks for this info, Patrick.  I've been making her *History of Ancient
and Early Medieval India *a set text for my courses for several years now,
and it's very good indeed (but sadly she hadn't read your *Kingship, Law
and Governance* before her book was published, so the Mauryan chapter needs
to be redone).

I look forward to reading the new one.

Best,
Dominik
