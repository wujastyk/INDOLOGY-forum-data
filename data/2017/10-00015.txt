[INDOLOGY] [RISA-L LIST] New Book
Thanks for this info, Patrick.  I've been making her *History of Ancient
and Early Medieval India *a set text for my courses for several years now,
and it's very good indeed (but sadly she hadn't read your *Kingship, Law
and Governance* before her book was published, so the Mauryan chapter needs
to be redone).
I look forward to reading the new one.
Best,
Dominik
