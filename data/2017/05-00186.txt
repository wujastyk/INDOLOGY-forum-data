[INDOLOGY] Patanjali in the Puranas?
Thank you much for the copy of Meulenbeld's pages providing us with probably all the references available at the time of their writing. I would add Harimoto's brief comment in "God, Reason and Yoga" (2014)  p. 215, about the famous ("widely known among the grammarians" - and in this respect quoted  for instance in the introductory colophons of several Mah?bh??ya mss., and by various commentators, not only on the YS like Vij??nabhik?u) stanza which is also found in the final (post-)colophons of the YVi mss.:
yogena cittasya padena v?c??  mala? ?ar?rasya tu vaidyakena | 
yo 'p?karot ta? pravara? mun?n??  pata?jali? pr??jalir ?nato 'smi || 
This "multi-shared/"floating" stanza could be older than the statement found in the introductory stanza (5, 6 or 7) of Bhoja's commentary on the YS (which allows Bhoja to declare that he too has composed in the three fields), or the introductory stanza (3) of Cakrap??i's commentary on the CarakaS (quoted by Woods 1977: xix). 
Going back to Aklujkar's point  'b', it should be noted that according to Meulenbeld himself (p. 143) "Bhart?hari's V?kyapad?ya contains a verse that obviously also refers to Pata?jali as a threefold authority, though without mentioning his name".
See :
k?ya-v?g-buddhi-vi?ay?  ye mal?? samavasthit?? /
cikits?lak?a??dhy?tma-??strais te??? vi?uddhaya? // VP 1.174 //
and Biardeau 1964 (pp. 186-7) for the text (and French translation) of the old v?tti (ad 1.146 in her edition), which also does not refer namely to Pata?jali (and does not ascertain that adhy?tma-??stra means here yoga-??stra, as it has been understood by later commentators; the "v?k-ceto-vapu??? mala? pha?ibh?t?? bhartr?_iva yena_uddh?ta?..." of Bhojadeva sounds in its beginning like an echo of Bhart?hari's stanza, with the use of the word bhart? [of the serpents = Pata?jali] possibly evoking in a pun also the name of the author of the VP).
Dominik's statement that Bhoja's assertion is the first clearly attested one remains nevertheless not contradicted by Meulenbeld's mere opinion (not shared by Biardeau) on Bhart?hari's stanza.
The parallelism traced by Meulenbeld between the "multifaceted" legendary figures of N?g?rjuna and Pata?jali, both "Lords of serpents", is interesting.
Best wishes,
