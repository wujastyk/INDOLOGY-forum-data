Dear Walter, Dear J?rgen,
This is an excellent initiative, thanks for sharing this significant new
research tool !

Since you base yourself on lexicographical works "seit den Petersburger
W?rterb?chern von O. B?htlingk (speziell dem ?pw?, 1879-89) und dem darauf
aufbauenden Werk von R. Schmidt (1928)" it is not immediately clear whether
pre-1928 critical studies in lexicography (critical of the remarkable work
done by B?htlingk and Roth) have sufficiently been taken into account.
Think of Johann Georg B?hler 1894 The Roots of the Dh?tup??ha not found in
Literature, Indian Antiquary 23 (1894) 141-154, 250-255; WZKM 8, 17-42,
122-136, partially reprinted in Staal J. F. (ed.) A Reader on the Sanskrit
Grammarians, MIT Press, 1972, 194-204.
J.G. B?hler is quite critical of earlier lexicographical efforts: ?no
Sanskritist can afford to leave the modern vernaculars out of the range of
his studies, if he wishes really to understand the ancient language? (1894:
150).

I am curious why you list ? Suppl[e]ment to Dictionary of P??inian
Grammatical Terminology. ? Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research
Institute, vol. 90 (for 2009) : 127-151 (actual date of appearance: 2011),
but not Roodbergen's Dictionary of P??inian Grammatical Terminology itself
(Pune: Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, 2008).

You have taken several lexicographical works of Louis Renou into account,
but I do not see
Renou, Louis. 1953. Vocabulaire du rituel v?dique. Paris: C. Klincksieck.
Renou, Louis. 1957. Terminologie Grammaticale du Sanskrit. 2e impression.
Paris: Champion.

I also miss in your list Caland, Willem and Victor Henry 1906-07:
L'Agni??oma. Description compl?te de la forme normale du Sacrifice de Soma
dans le culte v?dique. Tome I-II. Paris: Ernest Leroux, which contains a
list of terms relevant to Vedic ritual.

Specific studies of medical terminology seem not to have received
sufficient attention in this stage of your project.
I guess that a study such as A. Raison, "Un dictionnaire de mati?re
m?dicale d'apr?s les chapitres III ? XII du Rajanighantu",  which appeared
in G.J. Meulenbeld (Ed.) (1984), 251--260, would be usable.
