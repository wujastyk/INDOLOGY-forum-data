Dear colleagues,
Can you help me where I used the 'might have' expression?
 >His Edicts are routinely decontextualized. Dr. Ambedkar's statement, re:
removal of idols, is a good example of such practice.
Asoka's edicts. Where is the indication in the quote that it is about
edicts?
At the most, Dr Ambedkar's words in the quote can be argued as making
statements without providing a supporting a historical evidence.
If it is established through historical evidences conclusively that Asoka
did not remove deities or their idols, then the quote from Dr Ambedkar can
be described as 'falsification of historical evidence'.
