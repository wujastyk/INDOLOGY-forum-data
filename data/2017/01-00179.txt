Thanks to Tim Lubin and Antonio Ferreira-Jardim for identifying Antonia Ruppel and dissolving my suspicion.

I would say the book has a number of fine merits.  For my tastes, sandhi is introduced at too leisurely a pace, but I expect that many teachers will find it suits their students.  Certainly everything is very clearly explained.  Apart from the sentences devised for practicing new grammar point, the other readings consist of stanza (lightly modified at first) drawn from works like the Pa?catantra.  These would benefit from a bit more context, which could be provided by the instructor (I suggest having the students read the relevant tale in translation) or perhaps on the companion website.
