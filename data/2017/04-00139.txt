[INDOLOGY] Buddhavacanam
Dear list,
Without being intended to be related to this thread, I just received an email from Dylan Esler informing me that the volumes of the  ?Buddhist Forum? (ed. Dr. Tadeusz Skorupski) are available here :
among which
http://www.shin-ibs.edu/publications/the-buddhist-forum/the-buddhist-forum-volume-v/
which deals with the question of the Buddhavacana on several pages.
Best wishes,
Christophe
