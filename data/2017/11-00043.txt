[INDOLOGY] Explanation of a Mahayana Verse
Dear Alakendu Das,
The catu?ko?i is the four possible points stated in the quote you gave:
something 1. does not exist, n?sti; 2. does exist, asti; 3. both exists and
does not exist, tad-ubhaya; 4. neither exists nor does not exist, anubhaya.
Best regards,
