[INDOLOGY] INDUS CIVILISATION.
 Dr.Anderson,
              Thanks everybody for elaborating on the matter  
     However, ,in this connection I would like to qoute a few lines from  Pg 19 of the book 'An 
Advanced History of India' by Dr.R.C. Majumdar et al ( Publisher -MACMILLAN, First edition 
1946,Latest Reprint 1988), which says, in a Chapter on IVC - ' More than five hundred seals have 
been disccoverd....... made of Terra-Cotta .All of them contain ,a short record  inscribed in a 
sort of pictorial writing ,which still remians undeciphered.'
           My question is -;Whether it implies what we call hieroglyphics?
                                                          ALAKENDU DAS.
