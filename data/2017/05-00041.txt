=?utf-8?Q?Re:_[INDOLOGY]_Tracing_a_verse_in_the_Pur=C4=81=E1=B9=87as?=
Dear Madhav,
According to the verse-index of the Nag Publishers printing of the
*Padmamah?pur??am* (so on title page), this is P???la kha??a (the 5th),
adhy?ya 108, verse 20. I checked the text, and this reference is correct.
As we know, but not stated on the copyright pages of the Nag Publishers
printings of the pur??as, they are photographic reprints of the Ve?ka?e?vara
Press editions published in manuscript form at Bombay in the early 1900s.
The added verse-indexes to the Nag Publishers reprints are very helpful. I
do not know of a cumulative verse index for all of the major pur??as. This
would be very helpful indeed.
Best regards,
David Reigle
