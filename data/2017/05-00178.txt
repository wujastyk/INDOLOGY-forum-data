In a recent post on the Indology forum, I had written (with members from India principally in mind) that the RSO  ?may not be easily accessible?. Prof. Raffaele Torella, thereafter, informed me that ?RSO is easily available on JSTOR starting from the first issue (1907).? I am happy to share this piece of information.
