Most likely this is an error. The two electronic versions seem to be related.

Titus:

?atapatha-Br?hma?a (M?dhyandina recension)
Books 1-11, 13-14:
Data entry under the guidance of W.P. Lehmann (Austin, Texas) by H.S. Ananthanarayana (Hyderabad); adaptation by J.R. Gardner <http://vedavid.org/> (Iowa)  <http://vedavid.org/SBintro.html>
Gretil:

Satapatha-Brahmana, Madhyamdina recension (input by John Robert Gardner)
