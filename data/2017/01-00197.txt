The /Avacchedakat?nirukti/, a supplement by Gad?dhara Bha???c?rya (circa 
1604?1709) to the commentary /D?dhiti/ on the /Tattva Cint?ma?i /written 
by the great philosopher Raghun?tha ?iroma?i (circa 1477?1547), deals 
with the interpretation of /avacchedakatva/, the individuality of 
invariable concomitance in inference (/vy?pti/), elaborating upon 
Raghun?tha ?iroma?i?s treatment of the topic. In his own commentary, the 
/Subodh?/, Prof. N.S. Ramanuja Tatacharya clarifies the most difficult 
portion of this ??stric text, and renders it accessible by presenting it 
in simple and lucid language.
