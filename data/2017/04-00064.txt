One might also mention the Paln??i V?racaritra of ?r?n?tha, 15th century. This is a written Telugu version of an oral epic studied by Gene Roghair in his important book The Epic of Palnadu: A Study and Translation of Palnati Virula Katha, A Telugu Oral Tradition from Andhra Pradesh, India. George

Right from the time of study of villupp???u by Prof. Blackburn, parallel written transmission of 'folk' 'oral' texts in regional Indian languages is being paid attention to.

>> Ma question : pour comparaison avec le Sejarah Melayu, existe-t-il dans la tradition indienne (vedique ou epique p.ex.) des textes qui se sont transmis d?une part de facon ecrite (copies de manuscrit en manuscrit), d?autre part sans support ecrit (un scribe mettant pas ecrit un texte qu?il connait par coeur) ? Je pense que cela s?est produit pour le SM : certaines variantes (ex. le deplacement d?episodes) ne peuvent s?expliquer que par un stade de memoire. As-tu la reference d?un article sur le sujet, ou possedes-tu un livre qui en parle ?
