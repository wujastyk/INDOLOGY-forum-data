[INDOLOGY] Warder Sanskrit Reader
Dear Colleagues,
I was intrigued to hear of a Sanskrit reader by Warder in a recent thread.
I have since sought to obtain it via inter-library loans.
I have been told there are NO COPIES available in the U.K.
Does anyone have any advice as to how to obtain a copy?
Best Wishes,
