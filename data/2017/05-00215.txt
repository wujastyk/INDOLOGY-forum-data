I have no idea about just what Dr. Ambedkar may have had in mind in regard to Asoka,
but I do think that the question of the emergence of images and idols in India should be empirically focused.

See, for instance, Michael Willis,

Although Willis prudently avoids the question of beginnings, some interesting suggestions may be gleaned
