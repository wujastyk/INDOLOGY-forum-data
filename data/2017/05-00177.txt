[INDOLOGY] Ashokan Pillars' transport
Dear Harry,
I am ashamed; I have the book, you presented it to me personally three
years ago, while in Warsaw. I should have checked it for the info re:
Chunar.
You mention there 'old road rollers'. My technological imagination is very
scant --- were these stone 'drums' used to transport bigger, heavier pieces
out of the quarry?
In what way?
Respects,
Artur Karp
