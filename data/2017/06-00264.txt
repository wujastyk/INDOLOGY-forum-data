[INDOLOGY] Sanskrit idiom question - sidetracked
To the best of my knowledge, kr?ra[graha] is never used as a proper name 
or exclusive epithet of one planet/graha, but only as a synonym of 
p?pa/a?ubha/asaumya/etc., a category that always includes Mars and 
Saturn, and often the sun, R?hu and Ketu.
