[INDOLOGY] Font?
Hello Madhav,
I haven't done this but I'd have thought that if you took the Latin
Modern r and l underdots as a model then you might be able to use
something like FontForge to create new characters by simply replacing
the dots with circles:

The LM fonts are quite well designed so might make a decent starting
point ...
