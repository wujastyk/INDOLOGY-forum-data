[INDOLOGY] Help to find verse
Dear all.
I'm looking for a verse on Nyayashastra with the following meaning:
One may read this work and feign understanding. One may even teach it. One
may even write commentaries on it. But he may still miss the secrets hidden
herein.
I am not able recall the source too. Kindly anyone help..
