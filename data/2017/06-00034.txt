While the earlier discussion has been the cultural differences of Kerala brahmins, are there early discussions of the ?c?ras of Kerala non-brahmins, particularly persons outside Kerala? About 50 years ago, I heard an orthodox non-Kerala person say ?Kera?am v?nara ?c?ram?. When I asked him why he said so, he said it was because of the history of polyandry in Kerala and he cited the story of T?r?, the wife of V?lin, as an example of a woman with more than one husband. I do not know the source of that saying. Recently, I came across an article that discusses the Western attitudes towards the status of women in Kerala society. (http://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/the-woman-who-cut-off-her-breasts/article17324549.ece <http://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/the-woman-who-cut-off-her-breasts/article17324549.ece>) The question I have is this, did people outside Kerala have such negative view of the Kerala society before the advent of the Portuguese or was it a colonial development?
Thanks in advance
