10th Annual Lawrence J. Schoenberg Symposium on Manuscript Studies in the Digital Age

November 2-4, 2017

Intertwined Worlds


Registration now open!



In partnership with the Rare Book Department<https://libwww.freelibrary.org/rarebooks/index.cfm> of the Free Library of Philadelphia, the Schoenberg Institute of Manuscript Studies (SIMS<http://schoenberginstitute.org/>) at the University of Pennsylvania Libraries is pleased to announce the 10th Annual Lawrence J. Schoenberg Symposium on Manuscript Studies in the Digital Age.

Despite the linguistic and cultural complexity of many regions of the premodern world, religion supplies the basis of a strong material and textual cohesion that both crosses and intertwines boundaries between communities. This year?s theme, ?Intertwined Worlds,? will highlight the confluence of expressions of belief, ritual, and social engagement emerging in technologies and traditions of the world's manuscript cultures, often beyond a single religious context. It will consider common themes and practices of textual, artistic, literary, and iconographic production in religious life across time and geography, from ancient precedents to modern reception and dissemination in the digital age.

The program will begin Thursday evening at 5:00 pm on November 2nd, 2017, at the Free Library of Philadelphia, Parkway Central Library, with a keynote lecture by Phyllis Granoff, Yale University. The symposium will continue November 3rd-4th at the Kislak Center of Special Collections, Rare Books, and Manuscripts at the University of Pennsylvania Libraries.
