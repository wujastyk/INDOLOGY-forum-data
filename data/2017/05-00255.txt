Subject: [INDOLOGY] Corrections to Muktabodha Digital Library
Message-ID: <CAPW7aQEmqaADWtRzJ5pZyMk_s92bdF07hgzbr+T4FTiV+mOU6g@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list members,

Due to coding error in the Muktabodha Digital Library it appeared that the
following manuscripts and manuscript bundles were not uploaded in in the
"Paper Transcripts of the French Institute of Pondicherry".  This has now
been corrected.  Note: This collection is a collaborative project of
Muktabodha with the French Institute of Pondicherry and Ecole francaise
d'Extreme-Orient (French School of Asian Studies).

Transcripts now available
T0011,  T0079, T0570A, T0746, T0765, T0758, T0770.

The details of these manuscripts and manuscript bundles are:
