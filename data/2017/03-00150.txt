Sri Sudalaimuthu Palaniappan avarghal,
If the south Indian authorship of Srimadbh?gavata pur??a and presence of
cultural aspects such as ?l?v?r saints is established, it will help
establish north-south integration in contributing to 'Hinduism' and will
help unlock the processes of 'convergence' and different 'substrata' in the
'cultural area' (similar to 'linguistic area') called India.
Wish you success in the endeavor.
