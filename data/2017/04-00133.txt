[INDOLOGY] Female name Bhaayi?
According to David Pingree (CESS A5: 335), the astrological author Y?davas?ri (early 17th century, Gujarat?) lived in a place called V??. In support, Pingree quotes the author's T?jikayogasudh?nidhi (16.27):
?r?vatsasa?j??d dvijapu?gav?dya? ?r?v??n?mni supure ca s?dhv? |
?r?y?davena vyarac?ha tena sudh?nidhis t?jikayogap?rva? ||
This is neither metrically nor syntactically satisfactory. On examining a manuscript of the text, I found that it read:
?r?vatsasa?j??d dvijapu?gav?d ya? ?r?bh?yin?mn? su?uve ca s?dhv? |
?r?y?davena vyarac?ha tena sudh?nidhis t?jikayogap?rva? ||
Y?davas?ri thus appears to give his mother's name as ?r?bh?yi. I have not come across this name before -- can anyone confirm that it exists?
Thanks in advance,
