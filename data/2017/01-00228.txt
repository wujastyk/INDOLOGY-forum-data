[INDOLOGY] INDUS CIVILISATION.
 To All,
      While going through some books on Indus valley civilisation , I failed to find out one 
answer. Though the Harappana & Mohenjo daro script has been inferred as more of a Hieroglyphic 
type, what dialect/language  did they speak ? 
Would love  to be enlightened on this point.
                                                         ALAKEND DAS.
