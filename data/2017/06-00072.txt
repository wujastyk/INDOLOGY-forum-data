[INDOLOGY] A new Sanskrit Reader
Dear Antonia,
     Short passages from Pata?jali's Mah?bh??ya, ?abara's
M?m??s?s?trabh??ya, ?a?kara's and R?m?nuja's Ved?ntas?trabh??yas would be
very useful.  Similarly, small portions of introductory ??stric texts like
the Tarkasa?graha, Ved?ntaparibh??? and M?m??s?-Ny?ya-Prak??a would be
useful. Along with K?vyas, I would suggest including a sample act of drama,
and a short section from K?vya??stra.  I am assuming that your book would
serve as an introduction to Sanskrit literature in a wide sense of the
term.  I am looking forward to your work.
