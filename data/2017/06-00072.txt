Dear Antonia,

     Short passages from Pata?jali's Mah?bh??ya, ?abara's
M?m??s?s?trabh??ya, ?a?kara's and R?m?nuja's Ved?ntas?trabh??yas would be
very useful.  Similarly, small portions of introductory ??stric texts like
the Tarkasa?graha, Ved?ntaparibh??? and M?m??s?-Ny?ya-Prak??a would be
useful. Along with K?vyas, I would suggest including a sample act of drama,
and a short section from K?vya??stra.  I am assuming that your book would
serve as an introduction to Sanskrit literature in a wide sense of the
term.  I am looking forward to your work.
