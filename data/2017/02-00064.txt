[INDOLOGY] Devipurana (2)
Hazra's Studies in the Upapur??as vol. 2 (1963) deals extensively with the DeviiP pp. 46-239. He refers to the Bengali characters (Vangavasi Press) ed. as the only one existing at that time.
The v. 6b of ch. 39 is given p. 63 fn. 127 as:
The presentation of the chap. 39 at the same page says:
"Names of holy places in which Devii was worshipped in her different forms by different gods, sages and kinds (including Jaamadagnya, Bhauma's son, Vibhii.sa.na and Raajasena) viz., [...] Ki.skindhyaa-parvata [...]"
I do not see in his detailed description (nor in the following one of the KaalikaaP) reference to such a list of 64 devii-pii.thas.
Hope it may help,
Best wishes,
Christophe
