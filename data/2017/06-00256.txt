Dear Prof Deshpande,
Thanks for your email. It would be obviously easy to read the English
version. I hope someone will have a PDF copy. Even though I have lost all
my Marathi (??? ????? ?????? ??? ????) yet the Marathi version of the book
would be welcome. I might actually try revising some Marathi from it.
Thanks very much in advance. Please send it across.
