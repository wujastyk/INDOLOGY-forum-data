[INDOLOGY] Request for unicode version of tattvabodhinI 6.2
https://github.com/aupasana/ashtadhyayi/tree/master/tattvabodhini
has tattvabodhinI commentary for all pAdas except 6.2
It seems that the source from which the data was derived lacked 6.2, as can
be seen from discussion at https://github.com/aupasana/ashtadhyayi/issues/2.
I would be grateful if some scholar whose copy has this missing 6.2 pAda
can send it across.
Best regards,
Dr. Dhaval Patel, I.A.S
