[INDOLOGY] SDS better scans found
Dear Adriano,
I concur with Matthew?s recommendation. Mahendra Kum?r Jain?s editions are meticulously edited and his doxographic annotations are invaluable.  Luigi Suali?s edition is far less reliable. I am elated to see that  his edition of this commentary now readily available. I searched in vain for it  a few years ago.
Best regards,
Elliot
