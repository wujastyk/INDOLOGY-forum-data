[INDOLOGY] Sarvadarshan Samgraha
 Thanks for the response. I have  ,in my possession , the Bengali transalation by Satyajyoti 
Chakravarty. I would certainly search  for the translation by Cowell & Gough. 
  In fact, SarvadarshanSamgraha is such a text ,where one finds the entire gamut of Indian 
philosophy in one single volume.More so,Because Madhhyachrya was a Vedantist, but had wide 
exposure to all other schools,quite like Bachaspati Misra.( He  enjoyed an epithet- Shada Darshan 
 TikaKrit)
                                       Thanks everybody.
                                                         ALAKENDU DAS.
