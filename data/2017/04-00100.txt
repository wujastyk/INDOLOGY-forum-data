[INDOLOGY] Gita meter
Now that the focus of this thread has shifted to BhG, chapter 11, the following article by Mislav Jezic might be of interest:
"The Tristubh Hymn in the Bhagavadgita".

Onderwerp: Re: [INDOLOGY] Gita meter
Hello everyone,
In the  introduction to my Gita translation, I include "A Note on Chapter 11," which argues on the basis of metrical and thematic reasons [similar to Jan's] that this chapter is an interpolation.  John Brockington has pointed out that this chapter does not fit well into its context.  He points out that chapter 12 "seems to pick up immediately from chapter 10" [See his essay; "The Bhagavadgita: Text and Context" in J.  Lipner's anthology "The Fruits of our Desiring: An Enquiry into the Ethics of the BhG for Our Times" (Calgary: Bayeux Arts, 1997].  He cites several scholars who have argued that the BhG was stitched together by two or more authors.
I hope that this note is useful.
George

In the case of the 11th chapter I would consider it a matter of author?s choice of a meter suitable to the particularly awe-inspiring subject.
Best, Jan

Hello Edwin,
     In her article "The Mahabharata's Core" (1975), Mary Carroll Smith has argued that there was an ancient core of the Mahabharata in Tri??ubh verses, which was later expanded by the addition of the narrative in Anu??ubh.  I am not sure how this would account for the metrical variation in the Bhagavadgita, but there is a suggestion from this article.

Greetings everyone,
Is there anything written about when and why the Gita changes its meter,
or does anyone on the list have an opinion about this?  At least in
several instances, I can see no narrative reason for this, nor shift in
theological content. At least in the second chapter which borrows two
verses from the Katha, I wonder whether this occurs with verses being
borrowed from elsewhere,  but I don't know.  Has anyone thought about this
or can anyone point me to anything written on it?
Thanks.  Edwin Bryant.
