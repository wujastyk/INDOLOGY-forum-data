Subject: [INDOLOGY] Pippalagrama of the Nikumbha king?
Message-ID: <dc579211-0472-9c71-9a69-3d6c472c22d6@gmail.com>

An astrological text (the /T?jikamukt?vali/ by Tuka, of the G?rg?ya 
gotra), dating to 1549-50 CE, describes its place of origin thus:

?r?v?japey?dikayaj?ak?dbhir vidvaddvijendrair bahubhi? ?rutena |
nikumbhava??aikan?pe?varasya ?r?pippalagr?mavare k?teyam ||

I should greatly appreciate any suggestions on where this 'Pippalagr?ma 
of [the?] one king of the Nikumbha dynasty' (if that is how the verse 
should be construed) is likely to have been found.

Best wishes,
Martin Gansten
