Subject: [INDOLOGY] Lucid dreaming in Sanskrit?

Many thanks to all who replied to this query. So far there seems to be 
precious little material on lucid dreaming in Sanskrit, particularly in 
non-Buddhist sources. The reference to Pata?jali is presumably to YS (or 
PY?, if one prefers) 1.38, but the connection looks slim to nonexistent 
to me; the same is true of Ha?ha(yoga)prad?pik? 4.49, though I haven't 
explored any commentarial literature on that passage. The 
Hanneder/Mok?op?ya reference sounds more promising, and I'll try to 
follow it up. Eli Franco mentioned the term svapn?ntika-j??na, but not 
where it is found; I see that Monier-Williams (following B?htlingk/Roth) 
gives the Vai?e?ikas?tra as a source for svapn?ntika -- an unlikely 
place for a discussion of lucid dreaming, I'd have thought, but worth 
looking up.

Thanks again,
Martin G.
