[INDOLOGY] Autsanash Purana
Thanks to Ashok, Dominik and Christophe for your replies.
Rana Singh replied to an email over the weekend, that the "Autsanash
Purana, is a sthala purana - no way standard or recognised one and neither
even published properly".
He claims that he consulted with a local pandit and his family regarding
this text and does not have a copy himself.
I asked about the spelling he uses but he didn't clarify this point, this
-t-, it seems, is more than a typo, as it appears in several publications
of his regarding this pilgrimage.
All the best,
