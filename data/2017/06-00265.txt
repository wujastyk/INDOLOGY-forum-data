Journal of South Asian Intellectual History
<http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/25425552>

The Journal of South Asian Intellectual History (SAIH) is dedicated to the
study of the history of ideas in pre-modern and early modern South Asia.
The main concern of the publication is to advance philological and
historical research into the rich intellectual history of South Asia in
fields such as (but not limited to) philosophy, logic, astronomy, medicine,
mathematics, literature, philosophical theology, and mystical traditions.
Sources of such investigations may be produced in any of the languages of
South Asia, including, for example, Sanskrit, Urdu, Persian, Gujarati,
Malayalam, Kannada, and Arabic. Given the nature of intellectual
interactions in pre-modern and early modern South Asia, the Journal also
welcomes articles, written in English, working across various disciplinary
boundaries and languages.
