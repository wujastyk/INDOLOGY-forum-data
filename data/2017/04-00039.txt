[INDOLOGY] DIPAVAMSA-AUTHOUR
  Of late, I am going through a book on the Chronicles of Ceylone.The two most well-known 
chronicles of Ceylone are-Dipa Vamsa and Maha Vamsa. The authour of Mahavamsa has been confirmed 
as Thera Mahanama .Can anybody kindly  suggest  a name who authoured Dipa Vamsa.? There is 
another area of interest in Dipavamsa ,which drew my attention. It states-' DipaAgamanam 
Buddhassha ...... " Thus, can  it be inferred that Siddhartha Gautama Buddha  had set his foot on 
Lankan soil.? Any other evidences to corroborrate ? 
                                                      ALAKENDU DAS.
