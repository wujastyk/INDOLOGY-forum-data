Thanks for the suggestion, Matthew. I agree about the problems inherent 
in establishing the non-existence of a name (or anything else, for that 
matter), but what I was hoping for was something a little more robust, 
such as someone having actually seen the name Bh?yi (short -i in this 
instance) in a text, or heard it in real life. :-)
