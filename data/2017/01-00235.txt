[INDOLOGY] INDUS CIVILISATION.
I read the piece quickly, and found it interesting how Trump has made himself the absolute 
standard of mendacity. But I don't think anyone who, however mistakenly, has evidence to 
support their statements, should be compared to him.

    In my book "The Roots of Hinduism: The Early Aryans and the Indus Civilization", 
    New York: Oxford University Press, 2015, 
    I present manifold evidence for the Dravidian affinity of the Harappan language.

    There is no consensus about which language or languages the

    The script is considered by most to be logo-syllabic, not 
    heiroglyphic.
    Farmer, Witzel, Sproat consider it to be a sign system rather than a 
    script associated with any particular language.

    To All, While going through some books on Indus valley civilisation 
    , I failed to find out one answer. Though the Harappana & Mohenjo 
    daro script has been inferred as more of a Hieroglyphic type, what 
    dialect/language did they speak ? Would love to be enlightened on 
    this point. ALAKEND DAS.
