[INDOLOGY] LORD BUDDHA AND SRI LANAK
 To All,
          While going through a book on Ceylonese Buddhist Chronicles , I came across a 
reference from Dipavamsa ,which reads as follows-
                           DIPAGAMANAM BUDDHASSA DHATU CHA BODHIAGAMAM
          Evidently 'Dipaagamanam Buddhassa' this indicates a possiblity of Lord  Buddha 
laying  his blissful  step on Sri Lankan soil .
                         I was curious to know whether any other evidences exist hinting at 
Buddha's visit to Sri Lanka . Is it a fact that Lord Buddha himself came to Lanka or whetehr 
it was Emperor Ashoka's son Mahinda who first  introduced Buddhism to Sri LANKA ,during the 
reign of King Duttagamini 
                              ALAKENDU DAS.
                                             ALAKENDU DAS.
