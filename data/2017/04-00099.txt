John Brockington has pointed out that this chapter does not fit well into its context.  He points out that chapter 12 "seems to pick up immediately from chapter 10?

Actually, Chapter 12 seems to pick up immediately from Chapter 11. The first word in Ch 12 is ?evam,? ?thus,? and it refers to 11.55, the last verse of Ch 11. Both verses are about the bhaktas.

I don?t see anything in 10.42 to which 12.1 refers.

Best,
Howard

I am not sure how this would account for the metrical variation in the Bhagavadgita, but there is a suggestion from this article.
