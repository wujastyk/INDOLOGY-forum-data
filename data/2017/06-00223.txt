Dear Friends, I don't remeber if I've asked this before on list or not, but
I've always wanted to know some more biographical info on MR Kale, through
whose editions I first started reading Skt lit. I believe he taught at the
University of Bombay, but apart from that I've never come across anything
(and I know I've asked about somewhere). Thanks for any leads. Best,J
