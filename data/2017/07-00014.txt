[INDOLOGY] Sarvadarshan Samgraha
To All,
          While going through the initial verse of SarvadarshanSamgraha,I came across the following line
    SHREESHANGARPANITANAYAMNIKHILAGAMAAGNYAM
         SARVAGNYAVISHNUGURUMANHAMASHREYAHAM.
  My query is two-fold-
 1)What is the implication of the word 'SHREE SHANGARPANITANAYAM?
 2) Does the word SarvaVishnuGurum imply any sort of Vaishnava Heridity on the part of MadhyaCharya?
