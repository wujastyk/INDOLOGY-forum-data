[INDOLOGY] Rudra gayatri
Dear list members,
Happy new year.
There is a Rudra gayatri in a text in the Muktabodha digital library called
par?kramap?j? as follows:
?a?anan?ya vidmahe
citrap?d?ya dh?mahi
tan no rudra pracoday?t
1) Why  ?a?anan?ya ?  Is there a form of Shiva with 6 faces?
2) How would  citrap?da be translated in this context?
Thanks,
Harry Spier
