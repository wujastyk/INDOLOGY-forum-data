Dear list members,

Happy new year.

There is a Rudra gayatri in a text in the Muktabodha digital library called
par?kramap?j? as follows:

?a?anan?ya vidmahe
citrap?d?ya dh?mahi
tan no rudra pracoday?t

1) Why  ?a?anan?ya ?  Is there a form of Shiva with 6 faces?
2) How would  citrap?da be translated in this context?

Thanks,
Harry Spier
