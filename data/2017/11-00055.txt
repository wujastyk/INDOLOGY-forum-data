[INDOLOGY] Sources on Relationship btw Oral/Literary Traditions
I would recommend Stuart Blackburn?s Singing of Birth and Death: Texts in
Performance. This is, I think, an indispensable work for understanding the
interface between written and oral in traditional Indian culture. George

Dear Mark,
your student mentions ?the subsequent privileging of textual sources by the
colonial West and the Academy,? but my impression is that, at least for the
Mah?bh?rata and the R?m?ya?a, it was the other way around. There was a
privileging of oral sources or, rather, what scholars took to be their
??oral? ?sources? (since there is no evidence they existed except for what
scholars reductively extrapolated from their written versions). She may
want to read this paper on how scholars, using circular and unscientific
arguments, posited hypothetical oral versions of these texts:
https://www.academia.edu/34898668/John_Brockington_and_the_Sanskrit_Epics.
She will also find resources in *The Nay Science*, chapters 1?2 to answer
her entirely valid question, ?Who is excluded and/or included by the
privileging of one kind of knowledge over the other?? As this has been a
frequent source of misunderstanding (Jan Houben got our views wrong when he
wrote, ?except for Adluri and Bagchee most specialists agree this [oral
transmission] played an important role in the early transmission of the
Indian epics?), the point is not that an oral tradition does not exist, but
that scholars have failed to make a case that oral versions conforming to
their prejudices about the texts and the tradition actually existed?a point
we also clarify in the Brockington paper (see n. 8).
Best,
