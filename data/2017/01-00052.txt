[INDOLOGY] Tagore Quote
Dear Chris,
The 6th poem of Stray Birds has this aphorism:
IF you shed tears when you miss the sun, you also miss the stars. (6)
The bengali original (beo??ri?a p?khir?) of the above aphorism is as
follows:
???????? ????????? ????, ??? ???? ?????????? ??;
????? ???? ???? ??????? ????? ???? ??? (????????? ???????: 6)
In IAST:
din?nte s?ry?sta dekhe, yadi tumi a?rusikta hao;
r?tera ?k??a bh?le t?r?dera bandhu tumi nao ? (beo??ri?a p?khir?: 6)
Regards,
Suresh.
