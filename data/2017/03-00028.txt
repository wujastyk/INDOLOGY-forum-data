referring to the yogic technique of projecting one's consciousness into another's body.
The famous story of Sankara's possessing the corpse of a king so as to experience
erotic pleasures exemplifies this, though I don't have the references at hand to
confirm the terminology used in that case.
However, as this and other examples cited seem to indicate, prav??a alone is not
a technical term for a particular type of ritual or religious activity. It can by no means
be treated as a discrete category parallel to, say. bhakti.
