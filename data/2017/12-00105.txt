[INDOLOGY] Literature on Minakshi and Gauri puja
Hi. I?m delighted to hear about this effort! I grew up in a house just four doors away from Madurai Meenakshi Temple, and spent a lot of time there.
Well ? for starters ? you can listen to a specific Carnatic song rendered by three different musicians. The speciality of this song is that the song is full of allusions, and only the opening line is about the composer?s request. The song is in slow tempo, words are clearly enunciated. Sanskritists won?t have difficulty understanding the song.

There are plenty of references in Tamil. I?d be happy to share that information with you after the holidays.
I?d rather not inundate this list with my references. 
Please contact me off list if you?re still interested.
