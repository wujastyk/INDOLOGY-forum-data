[INDOLOGY] Vopadeva's Place of Origin
Hello Niranjan Saha,
There is a good discussion of Vopadeva?s (and Hem?dri?s) literary output by Durgamohan Bhattacharyya in the 1944 edition of the Mukt?phala with the Kaivalyad?pik?, Calcutta Oriental Series, No.5. I would be happy to send it to you.
Sincerely,
Jonathan Edelmann
