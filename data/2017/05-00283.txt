 From this October onwards Classical Tamil will also be introduced as a 
language for Master and as a second language on B.A. level. The focus 
both in teaching and research will be on premodern literature and 
traditional grammar and poetics, as well as on South-Indian Bhakti, 
especially in its Vishnuite varieties. Special attention will be paid to 
multi-lingual interaction between Tamil, Sanskrit and the other 
Dravidian languages. According to capacities, modern Tamil will also be 
included, because of its relevance for the later transmission and its 
importance in secondary literature. In addition there are plans for 
continued collaboration with the EFEO Pondy, where since 2003 yearly 
intensive course are taking place in the form of Classical Tamil Winter 
or Summer Seminars.
