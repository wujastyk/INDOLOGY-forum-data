[INDOLOGY] Gita 13.6
Dear HR-ji,
noun not adjective.
Yes, that is what I was about to point out.
In 13.6, it is a part of categories into which the "knowable field" as
opposed to the "field - knower"  is  divided.
????????????????? ???????????????? ? ?
??????????? ?????? ? ?~??? ??????????????? ? 13\-6?
Similar is its use in 8-18, 8-20
?????????? ???????? ?????? ???????????????? ?
??????????? ?????????? ??????????????????? ? 8\-18?
????????????? ???? ????? ???????? ???????????????? ?
?? ? ??????? ?????? ???????? ? ???????? ? 8\-20?
The words element and dimension used by you are very apt.
Interestingly it is both a dimension and element.
Just for analogy, space and time in contemporary Physics are both
dimensions and components. (Post Einstein, they are components of a
continuum.)
mah?bh?t?ni, indriyagoocar?h are part of the vyakta component. ahank?rah,
buddhih, indriy??i are parts of neither parts of the vyakta nor of the
avykta.
This vyakta, avyakta division has its foundations right from the rigvedic
expressions such as
p?d?sya vi?v?bh?t?ni trip?dasy?mr?tam divi.
v?d?ham?tam puru?am mah?ntam ?dityavar?am tamasah parast?t.
