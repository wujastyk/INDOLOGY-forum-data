REMINDER: WSC 2018 Paper Abstract Submissions Due Oct. 1
17th World Sanskrit Conference ? Vancouver, Canada ? July 9-13, 2018

Dear Colleagues,

This is a friendly reminder that there are only TWO WEEKS left to submit an individual paper abstract for the 17th World Sanskrit Conference, to be held in Vancouver, Canada, July 9-13, 2018. The last day to submit a proposal is OCTOBER 1, 2017.  If you haven't already done so, we encourage you to submit your abstracts in a timely manner. Please also encourage your colleagues and students to do the same, as we eagerly look forward to welcoming you all to Vancouver next year for the World Sanskrit Conference!

To begin the submission process, please visit our online submissions portal: https://wsc.ubcsanskrit.ca/ocs/wsc/2018/schedConf/cfp, where you will see the specific instructions for preparing a submission. If you have already submitted your abstract, you may also login to the portal again through the link above to manage/edit your submission and track its progress.

If you encounter any difficulties with the portal please get in touch with the WSC Secretariat (wsc2018 at ubcsanskrit.ca), and we will assist you in the process.

Some additional tips and notes:

* All proposals must be made through the online portal. We CANNOT accept emailed scans or PDFs.
* Because of limited space and time, each presenter may submit only one paper abstract for inclusion in the conference.
* Papers may be delivered in Sanskrit, English, or French. All correspondence with the Secretariat should also be in one of these three languages.
* A list of the 21 regular and 3 special sections of the WSC can be found here: https://wsc.ubcsanskrit.ca/conference-information/submissions-sections-convenors/.
* As you select your section during the proposal submission process, you may find that you need to scroll down *within* the menu to find sections 16 and beyond, depending on how your computer or device is set up.
* Abstracts should be prepared using Unicode input methods, and you should use a modern operating system (Mac OSX, Linux, Windows 7+, and most smartphones and tablets). Please note that the WSC website does not function on devices running Windows XP.
* Review of papers will begin in October 2017 and results will be announced January 2018 (early confirmation for visa purposes will be available in November 2017 for applicants from South/Southeast Asia).

Help spread the word! Please encourage your colleagues and students to visit the website (wsc.ubcsanskrit.ca) and submit an individual paper proposal by October 1.

As always, for up-to-date information, please consult the main conference website, wsc.ubcsanskrit.ca, and do not hesitate to contact the WSC2018 Secretariat (wsc2018 at ubcsanskrit.ca) for further assistance.
