Interestingly, Lalitha Kumari (see the references I gave in my previous post) when discussing the term an?c?ra, refers to the work of S. Venkitasubramonia Iyer (Religion, Art and Culture, Trivandrum: College Book House, 1977, p. 4) which evokes the grammatical explanation or N?r?ya?a Bha??atiri in his Prakriy?sarvasva (TSS 174 vol., p. 187 - I cannot check) according to whom the name has to be explained as "na ?c?ra? - an?c?ra?" with the particle na meaning "equal to", "other than", "opposed to", "absent from", "a little", and "contemptible" (na? tuly?nyaviruddh?bh?v?lpak?epe?u), whereas the ???karasm?ti explains it in the sense of "absent from" (abh?va). Cf. LDhP 12,4.2: 
anyatra_?c?ra?a-abh?v?d an?c?r?n bh?gu-udvaha? / 
y?n ?ca??a catu??a??im ?khy?sye tatra t?n api //
"I shall enumerate all the 64 irregular habits there that the scion of Bh?gu called so because these conducts are not found elsewhere" (Parpola).
"Irregular habits" is in this case more appropriate than "repugnant customs", "bad habits" or "mal-obsevances".
It is possible that the portion listing the sixty four an?c?ras and corresponding to adhy?ya 12, p?da 4 of the  Laghudharmaprak??ik?, was separately known as the An?c?ra-nir?aya.
