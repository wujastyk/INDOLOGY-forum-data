[INDOLOGY] Correct reading in Taittiriya Samhita edition?
Dear list members,
Three editions of the Taitttiriya Samhita, the edition of Weber, the
edition of Satvalekar, and the edition of Kasinatha Agase differ in a
reading.
In the Taittiriya Samhita 4.5.1 verse 2
D
Satvalekar has      sarv?n jambhayantsarv??ca
Agase   has           sarv?njambhayansarv??ca
Weber   has          sarv??jambhayantsarv??ca
Satvalekar and Agase have  sarv?n where Weber has sarv??
Weber and Satvalekar have jambhayant where Agase has  jambhayan
Is this a case of misprints in one or more editions or some kind of case of
normalizing sandhi?
Which is the correct reading?
Thanks,
Harry Spier
