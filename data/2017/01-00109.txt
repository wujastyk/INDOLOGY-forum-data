Subject: [INDOLOGY] Correct reading in Taittiriya Samhita edition?
Message-ID: <CAPW7aQHacsNfT4oKe6GkXmcXiRaV3B5dQ3mMRH_RR=x3gd7d4A@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list members,
Three editions of the Taitttiriya Samhita, the edition of Weber, the
edition of Satvalekar, and the edition of Kasinatha Agase differ in a
reading.

In the Taittiriya Samhita 4.5.1 verse 2

D


Satvalekar has      sarv?n jambhayantsarv??ca

Agase   has           sarv?njambhayansarv??ca

Weber   has          sarv??jambhayantsarv??ca

Satvalekar and Agase have  sarv?n where Weber has sarv??
Weber and Satvalekar have jambhayant where Agase has  jambhayan

Is this a case of misprints in one or more editions or some kind of case of
normalizing sandhi?
Which is the correct reading?

Thanks,
Harry Spier
