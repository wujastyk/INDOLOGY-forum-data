Dear colleagues,

I published nearly thirty years ago an annotated Japanese translation of
the P?li *Vessantara-j?taka*, when I was studying under Prof. K. R. Norman
in Cambridge.

* Vessantara-j?taka Yakuch? *(???????????????) [An Annotated Japanese
Translation of the P?li *Vessantara-j?taka*], in: *The J?takas* (???????),
vol. 10, ed. by Hajime Nakamura, Tokyo: Shunj?sha, 1988, pp. 149?257,
263?317, ISBN4-393-11620-8.

As it is written in Japanese, I assume that no Western scholars of our
field has read it. When I wrote this, I checked all the then available Pali
manuscripts, and compared the Pali version with the Sanskrit, Tibetan and
Chinese versions and added 675 philological notes. According to my notes,
none of the versions except for the Pali J?taka has the part in question.

The discrepancy between four red deer and four horses results not from the
difference of the Southern and Northern traditions but from the
interpretation of the Pali verse, no. 215 in the *Vessantara-j?taka* itself.

The latter half of the verse in question reads as follows: *migarohiccava??ena
*(*v.l. mig? ro-*; CpA* mig? rohitava??ena*) *dakkhi?(?)ass? vahanti ma?*
?The excellent (lit. able) horses, looking like red deer, carrying me on.?
(Cf. M. Cone, *The Perfect Generosity of Prince Vessantara*, Clarendon
Press 1977, p. 33).

The composer of the prose part (ca. 5c. C.E.) misunderstood this verse and
wrote as follows: *catt?ro devaputt? rohiccamigava??ena ?gantv? rathadhura?
sampa?icchitv? agama?su* ?Four gods in the guise of red deer came, took the
yoke of the carriage and went forward.? (cf. Cone, loc. cit.; she
misunderstood the meaning of *sampa?icchitv?*). Thus, *dakkhi?(?)ass?* in
the verse was neglected in the prose part. This misinterpretation might
have based on the variant readings *mig? rohi- *in some manuscripts and CpA.

Murals, which show four horses, and the Butsarana must base on the old
verse, while those, which depict the red deer instead, base on the prose.

Such discrepancipies between prose and verses are found also in the
*Mah?vastu* and *Saddharmapu??ar?ka*, on which I am now working.

What I wrote above is not my finding. Alsdorf wrote about this discrepancy
in the *Vessantara-j?taka* 60 years ago!: ?Bemerkungen zum
Vessantara-J?taka?, in: Wiener Zeitschrift f?r die Kunde S?d- und
Ost-Asiens I (1957): 37-38 = *Kleine Schriften*, hrsg. von Albrecht Wezler,
Wiesbaden 1974 (GlSt 10), pp. 306f. I also quoted his argument in notes in
my Japanese translation, p. 278, n. 199, 200.

     With best regards,

Seishi Karashima
