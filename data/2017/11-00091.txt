Subject: [INDOLOGY] Extension, Reminder, and Details of Muktabodha Anniversary Tea at AAR
Message-ID: <CACP0xaW39mNNE_EYRti7WVBiGv255KTXD7amFnSNXuX5q2qncw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

Just a reminder that the Muktabodha Indological Research Institute is
marking its 20th anniversary this year with a celebratory tea in Boston,
held in conjunction with the annual American Academy of Religion Conference
next weekend.

EXTENSION: The tea time inadvertently overlaps with the Yoga in Theory and
Practice panel (4:30-6:30). As such, the tea has been extended so that it
now runs from 5:30-8:00, with an honoring of Bill Mahony, the founding
president of Muktabodha, to take place at 7:00.

The details are thus: Saturday, November 18, from 5:30-8:00 at the Westin
Copley Palace Hotel Newbury & Gloucester Rooms (10 Huntington Ave, Boston,
MA).

Hoping to see many of you there!

Warm regards,
Mark
