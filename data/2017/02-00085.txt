Subject: [INDOLOGY] Buddhist murals Sri Lanka Vessantara-Jataka
Message-ID: <4b7295b9-8e9d-690b-bd07-359a59b10a83@gmail.com>

Dear listmembers,
there is one episode in the Vessantara-J?taka which describes the 
following plot:

...After Vessantara gave away the two horses of his coach, Sakka advised 
four junior gods
to pull Vessantara's coach. They appeared in the guise of a red deer....

Some murals which depict this plot show four horses instead of the red deer.
As the only textual source I found one edition of the Butsarana with 
a?vave?a (for m?gave?a).
All Pali and further Sinhala sources read m?gave?a.

I suppose there is a northern tradition which records a?vave?a (Gilgit, 
Tibetan or Chinese).

Anyone came across this version and is willing to share this with me?

Thank you in advance

Heiner
