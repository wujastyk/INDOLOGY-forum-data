Message-ID: <CAMGmO4+rFbWCpjD4xXMkd-fx5_VuE2qZ1foHj7DphLYd2B55yg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Colleagues,

Thanks to good fortune, I have obtained a large funded project from the
European Union, which will allow me to offer positions, ultimately, to 2
post-docs and 3 PhD students, as well as two programmers.
Right now, for the first year of the project, to begin 1.1.2018, I am
seeking one Post-doc and one PhD student. Please see the adverts for the
posts as:

PhD: http://werkenbij.leidenuniv.nl/vacatures/phd-
posities/17-209-phd-candidate-in-buddhist-studies-.html

Post-doc: http://werkenbij.leidenuniv.nl/vacatures/
wetenschappelijke-functies/17-212-postdoctoral-researcher-
in-buddhist-studies-.html

Potential candidates should familiarize themselves with the project through
the proposal, which can be found here: https://leidenuniv.
academia.edu/JASilk

I would be delighted to answer any questions you or any potential
candidates might have!

With warmest thanks,

Jonathan Silk
