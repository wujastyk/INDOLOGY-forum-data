[INDOLOGY] Two positions, one PhD one post-doc: if you have a good candidate...
Dear Colleagues,
Thanks to good fortune, I have obtained a large funded project from the
European Union, which will allow me to offer positions, ultimately, to 2
post-docs and 3 PhD students, as well as two programmers.
Right now, for the first year of the project, to begin 1.1.2018, I am
seeking one Post-doc and one PhD student. Please see the adverts for the
posts as:

Post-doc: http://werkenbij.leidenuniv.nl/vacatures/

Potential candidates should familiarize themselves with the project through
the proposal, which can be found here: https://leidenuniv.

candidates might have!
With warmest thanks,
