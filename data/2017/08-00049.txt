There is also an entry in Oxford Bibliographies entitled Gender and Sexuality<http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195399318/obo-9780195399318-0157.xml>
by Anna Pokazanyeva that is an excellent resource if your colleague has access to that site.

Dear Shyam,

in such a case, a normal starting point would be any standard reference work. I would recommend e.g. Brill's Encyclopedia of Hinduism. The main article on this topic, Karen Pechilis' entry "Gender" (vol. 4, pp. 788-805), has an extensive and up-to-date bibliography. Plus this theme is discussed in several other entries in this Encyclopedia (they are easily to be found using an index).

Best,
Lubomir

Dear all,

This is a question from a colleague who is not on the list. This
colleague teaches a course on Sex and Gender theory and is interested in
articles that addresses the topic from differing cultural vantages. I
was asked about what was available on the topic that discusses the issue
from the perspective of the Indian tradition.  I didn't know what to
say. I'd be grateful for any suggestions.

Thanks,

Shyam
