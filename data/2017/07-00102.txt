=?utf-8?Q?Re:_[INDOLOGY]_Andr=C3=A9_Padoux?=
Whenever I visited Paris I never missed to visit Andr? at his home in rue S?guier, and once also at his country house along with my family. By saying Andr? I implicitly also refer to his wonderful wife, Anne-C?cile (it is often true that very close to each great man there also is a great woman). The last years of Andr? were deeply saddened by the tragic and absurd death of Anne-C?cile, yet he found the courage and energy to continue, some way ot other, his life as a man (or to be more precise, as a great gentleman) and a scholar.  I bitterly miss the great man and scholar he was.
