[INDOLOGY] Gita meter
I agree with Jan Houben as far as 11 th chapter in concerned. Moreover, I
think that  Tri??ubh verses are used in the important emotionally or
intellectually moments in the BhG (and maybe in the whole MBh), for
example, in chapter 2, when Krishna at first does not listen to Arjuna's
despair and begins his teaching only after Arjuna expresses his doubts
in Tri??ubh
verse.
