[INDOLOGY] Waray collection of MSS in Pune?
It appears that this G.S. Waray (???? in Marathi) is a relative of the
Annashastri Waray alias Shridhar Shastri Waray of Nasik, a well known
Shukla Yajurvedin Shastri, who had a sizable collection of Sanskrit
manuscripts that included a manuscript of the Maitr?ya?? Pr?ti??khya.  I
was interested in this manuscript, and spent several days in Nasik, but the
manuscript collection was locked up in an inheritance battle among the
descendants of Annashastri Waray and no one had access to it.  The Late
T.N. Dharmadhikari of Pune also tried to get access to this manuscript
collection, with no success.  The Nasik Nagar Vachanalaya has a sizable
collection of Sanskrit manuscripts donated by the local priestly family,
but at least at the time I went there and checked it, it did not include
the Waray collection.  I don't know what happened to the Pune branch of the
family.  Perhaps someone like Mr. Manjul from Pune may have some
information regarding this.
