An interesting question to pursue in this research is to what extent the illustrations and maybe the formatting (lines per page, rulings, etc.) are standardized. ?From informal observations in antique stores I suspect they might be, in a region. ?Following this up, one might wonder if scribes would make copies of major classics on speculation, not for a specific order, being pretty sure someone would want one before long. ?It would avoid wasting a period when business was slack. Finally, one might ask if the scribes sometimes did the illustrations themselvrs, rather than calling upon a painter.
