would anybody be able to help me locate Vacaspati Mi?ra?s K?tyacint?ma?i? From information gathered in various secondary sources, it seems the volume was published in Bengali in Benares (?aka 1814). I also know of a S?hitya Pari?ad (Calcutta) partial edition titled Vacaspatimi?ra k?ta durgottsavaprakara?am. So far, I have failed to find them both. I will be very thankful if you could assist in locating a copy to consult or, even better, to share a scanned/digital version of it.



With many thanks,
