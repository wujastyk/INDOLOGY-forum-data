Dear Alessandro,
For many early volumes of the JASB, a precious digital resources is the Biodiversity Heritage Library. You may try if their coverage goes as far as 1956.
Best wishes,

[INDOLOGY] neo-buddhistic nucleus in ala?k?ra??stra
Dear members,
Does anyone have S. Bhattacharyya's article "The Neo-Buddhistic Nucleus in Ala?k?ra??stra" from Journal of the Asiatic Soc. of Bengal, vol. 22 (1956) pp. 49-66? The microfilm copy here at the university is too blurry. Thanks.
Best,
