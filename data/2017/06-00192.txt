[INDOLOGY] Sanskrit Readers: overview
Dear Antonia,
Staal's Reader isn't really a reader that reproduces the Sanskrit texts of
the Sanskrit grammarians.  It reproduces discussions on the Sanskrit
grammarians by European scholars [in English, German, and French].  There
is a lot of Sanskrit in it, of course, but the major focus of the book is
on European scholarship on the Sanskrit grammarians, not on the texts of
the Sanskrit grammarians themselves.
Best wishes,
George
