Dear all,

I had already scanned my photocopy of this text and uploaded it when I saw
that Jonathan Silk had already supplied it to Seishi Karashima. So I will
go ahead and post the link anyway, just in case someone else might need
this or other texts at this link:

http://prajnaquest.fr/blog/sanskrit-texts-3/sanskrit-buddhist-texts/

Please note that my scan is of the 1940 reprint, presumably a photographic
reprint of the 1896 edition. In my days of trips in search of printed
Sanskrit Buddhist texts I did not have access to the Harvard University
Library, where the only copy of the 1896 edition was held according to M.
B. Emeneau's 1935 *Union List of Printed Indic Texts and Translations in
American Libraries*. I found the 1940 reprint at the University of
Washington library and photocopied it there.

Regarding the *Sam?dhir?ja-s?tra*, the 1896 edition says on the title page,
"Fasc. 1," according to Emeneau's listing. This is not on the title page of
the 1940 reprint. This edition has fifteen chapters and part of the
sixteenth. According to Nalinaksha Dutt in his 1941-1954 *Gilgit
Manuscripts* edition of the *Sam?dhir?ja-s?tra*, these are actually
chapters 1-11 and 16-18.

Constantin Regamey (1938) had edited chapters 8, 19, and 22. Seiren
Matsunami edited chapters 1-7 in *Taisho Daigaku Kenkyukiyo*, 1975.
Christoph Cuppers edited chapter 9 (Stuttgart, 1990). Andrew Skilton edited
extensive fragments from the Schoyen Collection in *Buddhist Manuscripts*,
vol. 2, 2002 (pp. 97-177). These are the partial editions that I know of.
If anyone knows of others, I would be glad to learn of them.

I do not know of anyone working on a critical edition of the whole text. It
is wonderful that a facsimile edition of the Gilgit manuscript of it will
be published in the near future.

By the way, if anyone wants unbound copies of our 1984 Canon Publications
reprint of Regamey's *Three Chapters from the **Sam?dhir?jas?tra*, I would
be glad to send them. I suppose that soon I will have to just recycle these
as paper.

Best regards,

David Reigle
Colorado, U.S.A.
