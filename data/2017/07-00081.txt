Dear Colleagues,

     Just to let everyone know that the next few months will be
transitional months for us, concluding in our final move to California
sometime in September.  I want to request that from hereon please do not
use my Ann Arbor address (home or University of Michigan departmental
address) to send any physical mail to me.  My transitional mailing address
is my daughter's address:

Madhav Deshpande
C/o Mrs. Madhushree Gupta
13740 Harleigh Court
Saratoga, CA 95070

    I will remain accessible on email without any change.  Thanks.

Madhav Deshpande
