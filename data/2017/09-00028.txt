Dear Colleagues,

     Please take a look at the attached advertisement for a
tenured/tenuretrack faculty position in Sanskrit at the University of
Michigan, and share it with all interested individuals. Since I have
retired from the University of Michigan recently, no correspondence
regarding this position should be sent to me personally.
    With best wishes,
