[INDOLOGY] Sanskrit tutors or schools in Kathmandu or Pokhara?
I have had the pleasure of studying Sanskrit with and alongside Joe LaRose
at McMaster University. I have no hesitation in endorsing him as a teacher
of Sanskrit. His knowledge of the details of the language, as well as his
manner and intensity in instruction, result in a productive learning
experience. Joe has been responsible for the growth of the Sanskrit
programme here. I am sure that he makes a key contribution to the programme
in Nepal.
