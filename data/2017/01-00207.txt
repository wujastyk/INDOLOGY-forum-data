[INDOLOGY] Article request: Samskaravidhi
Dear list members,
Quite urgently I need to access Prof. Acharya's article *Samskaravidhi*,
and I do not have access to my copy of *Melanges tantriques*, where it was
published (I literally left it on a different continent). If any of you has
a digital copy of the article, may I ask if you could send it to me? Below
I attach a full bibliographic reference.
Acharya, Diwakar. 2007. ?The *Sam?ska?ravidhi*: A Manual on the
Transformatory Rite of the Lakuli?s?a-Pa?s?upatas? in Dominic Goodall &
Andre? Padoux, *Tantric Studies in Memory of He?le?ne Brunner*. Collection
Indologie 106. Pondicherry: Institut Fran?ais de Pondiche?ry/Ecole
fran?aise d?Extre?me?Orient.
With best wishes,
