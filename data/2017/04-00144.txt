[INDOLOGY] Female name Bhaayi?
But in this case, neither of the two MSS I have been able to examine so 
far supports any of these readings. One consistently has /bh?yi/, at 
least 17 times; the other alternates between /bh?yi/ and /bh?i/. There 
is no b/v and no long ?. Therefore I am hesitant to accept this as a 
variant of the /b??/ suffix.
