[INDOLOGY] Embodying the Vedas
Dear Colleagues,
Some of you have pointed out that the links to download the book are hard
to find on the De Gruyter page. I agree and I have let them know as well.
To download each chapter one has to go to "Table of Contents" on the left
side of the website.
Alternatively, I have uploaded a single PDF on my Academia.edu page. This
should be easier for people to download.
Please use the following link for that:
https://www.academia.edu/32238577/Embodying_the_Vedas_-_Traditional_Vedic_Schools_of_Contemporary_Maharashtra
If you have any questions please let me know.
Thank you, everyone for your kind support.
Best wishes,
Borayin
