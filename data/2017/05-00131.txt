[INDOLOGY] price cap on digital photography at the Wellcome Library
I learned yesterday that there is a new policy concerning digital
photography at the Wellcome Library in London (that has a very large
collection of Indic books and manuscripts).  Normally, it's ?5 per photo
for high-res images.  And they do not offer low-res images of manuscripts.
But they have introduced a price cap of ?100 that applies to cover-to-cover
high-resolution photography only.
Best,
