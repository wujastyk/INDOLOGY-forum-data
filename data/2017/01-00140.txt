[INDOLOGY] Call for Papers: Special Issue of 'Religions' on Reincarnation
Dear Colleagues,
?
The link in the Call for Papers that Icirculated yesterday makes reference to a fee for processing ofsubmissions.? There will be no fee in thecase of this special issue.? In mytwenty-year career, I have yet to pay to publish anything.? I don?t plan to start now, nor do I expect itfrom any of you!
?
All the best,
Jeff
