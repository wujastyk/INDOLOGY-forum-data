[INDOLOGY] My Sanskrit rendering of Goethe's poem on Shakuntala
Thanks, Artur.  I have been wondering how to render "sp?teren Jahres," and
came up with gr??ma.  Perhaps, as you say, ?arat "autumn" is a better way
to do it.  To fit the meter of my poem, I can revise it to: ???? ???
?????????????.  Thanks for your input.  Best,
Madhav
