Dear Prof. Olivelle,

That symbol is the so-called *bhale* symbol, which
is associated with (but probably not restricted to,
s. Balbir et al. (2006) mentioned below) Jaina
manuscript culture.
The only source I can mention at the moment is:
G. Bhattacharya, "The bhale symbol of the Jainas",
Berliner lndologische Studien 8 (1995), pp. 201-228
(which, incidentally, is also referred to in
Balbir et al. (2006), Catalogue of the Jain Manuscripts
of the British Library, vol. 1, p. 56).

Best of luck to your student for his research.

Best wishes,
Gaia Pintucci
