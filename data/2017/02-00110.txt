Dear Martin,
     For a one semester introduction to P??ini, I would suggest that you
use an abridged version of P??ini like the Laghusiddh?ntakaumud?.  For
general readings on P??ini, I find the first Introductory volume of Rama
Nath Sharma's translation of the A???dhy?y? very useful and readable,
supplemented by a selection of readable articles on P??ini.
