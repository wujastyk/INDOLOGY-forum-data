[INDOLOGY] Issues with Sanskrit 2003 font
Dear Colleagues,

     Am I alone in seeing these problems, or is this happening only on Mac
computers, and not on Windows?  I have written to Omkarananda Ashram about
this and I am hoping to hear from them.
    If someone has a solution to this font problem, I would appreciate
hearing it.
