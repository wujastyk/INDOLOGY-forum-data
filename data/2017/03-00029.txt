[INDOLOGY] Query
Dear Herman,
The citation from Allen is puzzling. He seems to be saying that there are
recognizable ME and Chinese versions of Barlam, but at the end of the quote
is referring to Vidura's story. As I don't think that there is a Chinese version of
Barlam, is there perhaps something missing from the citation? Or is it
just a poorly constructed sentence?
