[INDOLOGY] Eli Franco and the Fate of Indology
Dear colleagues,
I, for my part, am irritated by the insinuated interpretation of  
Professor Falk's remark which I understand in the following way:
The incriminated subclause "because they are Indians"  -- in the  
phrase: "they want to be taken as authorities, because they are  
Indians" -- does *not* specify the reason of "their" wish for being  
"taken as authorites" (in the sense: because they are Indians, they  
want to be taken as authorities, i.e. Indians want generally to be  
taken as authorities). Instead, it specifies their presumed  
*individual* reason for being "taken as authorities" (= they want: to  
be taken as authorities merely for the reason that they are Indians).  
One may agree or disagree to this analysis of their motives, but I  
cannot see any reason for being "appalled and saddened" by this phrase.
With best wishes
Roland Steiner
