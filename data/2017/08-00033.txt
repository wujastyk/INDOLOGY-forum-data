[INDOLOGY] Ancient Indian archaeologists / treasure hunters
Dear Artur,
There are any number of Buddhist legends of scriptures found in ruins -- e.g., the tale of the
siddha Maitripa rediscovering the Ratnagotravibh?ga in a ruined st?pa.
The subterranean treasures guarded by n?gas and others may also be of interest here.
best,
Matthew
