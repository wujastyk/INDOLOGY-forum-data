Dear all

I am searching Srinivasacarya's Commentary on Mrcchakatikam book but could
not find.

Here is the reference:

History of Classical Sanskrit literature referred as printed Madras
in the para 600 and 577page

And referred by R.D Karmarkar in his preface for Mrcchakatika Edition with
Notes and tr by R D Karmarkar

I request if any one could find the entry in any libraries please provide
me the details

I have tried worldcat DLI etc but my spelling skill may not be good. Kindly
help

Thanks..
