[INDOLOGY] Query
An pioneering study on the history Barlam and Joasaph legend was by the Bollandist 
Paul Peeters s.j. "La premi?re traduction latine de ?Barlaam et Joasaph? et son original grec", Analecta Bollandiana 49, 1931, pp. 276-312. 
Following it, the (Manichean) Middle Persian version(s) was/were translated into Arabic (cf. survey of the versions + ed. and transl. of one of them by D. Gimaret 1971-72), and therefrom came the Christianized Georgian (rather than a Syriac one which had been postulated) version (cf. the works of  Lang 1955-1966 on the two, rather than one, Georgian versions) which was rendered into Greek by Euthymus the Athonite (the work is no longer ascribed to John Damascene). It is more or less what is told in the Wikipedia articles (in French, English or German) on "Barlam and Josaphat", but the name of Peeters is never mentioned. La Vall?e Poussin, who was close to Paul Peeters, was also interested by the problem in the years 1931-32 (cf. Revue de l'Universit? de Bruxelles, 1931-32, p. 218 ? http://digistore.bib.ulb.ac.be/2011/DL2503255_1932_000_037.pdf, in which there is also a paper by J. Przyluski on "L'influence iranienne en Gr?ce et dans l'Inde", pp. 283 sv.), but I did not find any publication on the topic by the Buddhist scholar.
In addition to the, already mentioned, introductory article by J. P. Asmussen in the Encyclopaedia Iranica (1988), there is for the (Manichean) Middle Iranian versions (which make the link between the Indian source(s) and the first Arabic version) the following important reference by Francois de Blois, "On the sources of the Barlaam Romance, or How the Buddha became a Christian saint", In:  Literarische Stoffe und ihre Gestaltung in mitteliranischer Zeit : Kolloquium anla?sslich des 70. Geburtstages von Werner Sundermann /? herausgegeben von Desmond Durkin-Meisterernst, Christiane Reck und Dieter Weber, Wiesbaden: Dr. Ludwig Reichert, 2009, pp. 7-26.
There should also be mentioned this other important book (co-directed) by Donald Lopez: In Search of the Christian Buddha: How an Asian Sage Became a Medieval Saint (2014): https://books.google.be/books?id=EiDQAgAAQBAJ
And on the Christian versions starting with the Byzantine one, this recent one:
Constanza Cordoni and Matthias Meyer eds, Barlaam und Josaphat: Neue Perspektiven auf ein europ?isches Ph?nomen, Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, 2015
