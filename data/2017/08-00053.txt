[INDOLOGY] sex and gender
Nagaraj,
It sounds like this habitat centre talk was more a homophobic hate group
than anything else.
These assertions *>>**Some difference between gay partnership and
heterosexual marriage is necessary. He argued that children adopted by
gays are very likely going to acquire a gay syndrome. This is going to be
unhealthy for the institution of family which is already under many threats
and is almost on the verge of extinction in Europe and America.*
are absolutely ludicrous. I do not see how someone like yourself is able to
articulate a sentence with the phrase "gay syndrome" in it, as if it has an
idiopathic etiology, and, as you implicitly phrase, a problem. Perhaps we
should get Ramdev's yoga involved to cure this 'mental illness'?
You and your colleagues seem exceptionally misinformed about child
wellbeing. I would strongly urge you to explore the literature on
children's wellbeing in gay families - which is abundant, here is one
example:
https://aifs.gov.au/cfca/publications/same-sex-parented-families-australia/childrens-wellbeing-same-sex-parented-families
Further to the point, if you are going to talk about the decline of
population as directly caused by, as you put it, 'the gays', and if Putin,
etc is so worried about population decline, perhaps they should look at the
neo-liberal system that places excessive economic pressure and job
instability on the younger generations, who feel unable to actually support
a family, and hence, either choose to not marry, marry later, or not have
kids at all

Also, a significant problem is the 50% reduction in the viability of male
semen https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2818620/
How can you honestly say that the LGBTI population, which across the globe
makes up less than 5% of the population, is to blame for wrecking families,
*>> Under the garb of providing equality the same right lobby is going to
create greater instability as gay marriages do not hold any particular
assurances of stability.*
NO MARRIAGE HOLDS ANY PARTICULAR ASSURANCE OF STABILITY.
I'll give you a very personal, anecdotal example. My auntie is a lesbian
and has been in a stable, monogamous relationship for over 30 years. I know
of many stable homosexual partnerships that have lasted as long, if not
longer, than many heterosexual partnerships.
 How can the 'gay syndrome' be the cause of the decline of the family, when
most families are nominally heterosexual, and they are the ones that are
responsible for estrangement and divorce?
All the best,
