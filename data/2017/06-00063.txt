[INDOLOGY] Fwd: Pippalagrama of the Nikumbha king?
I'm not sure what 'hailed from' implies in this context (it could be an 
ancestral connection), but it would have been good to see a textual 
source. Pingree, while not infallible, states (CESS A3, 177b ff.) that 
N?laka??ha was 'a resident of Dharmapura on the God?var? in Vidarbha' 
and '[o]ne of the leading astrologers at K??? in the late 16th century'. 
(?aka 1509 = 1587 CE; the 1567 is probably just a misprint.)
(Incidentally, N?laka??ha didn't actually author the Pra?natantra:)
