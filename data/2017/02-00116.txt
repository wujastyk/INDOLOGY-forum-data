[INDOLOGY] Skt vocabulary from the title pages and prefaces of Sanskrit editions
Dear Allen,
     At least in the Marathi speaking area, words like granth?laya and
granthap?la have by now been defined as replacements for English "library"
and "librarian".  My father used to teach a course in Granthap?lana??stra
referring to Library Science in Pune.  Similarly, the word Prak??ana and
Prak??aka have come to refer to Publishing and Publisher, while Samp?dana
and Samp?daka have come to refer to editing and editor.  It is possible to
see some fluctuation in the usage of these terms in the 18th and 19th
centuries, but over time, these words have become fixed in Marathi usage
with definite meanings.
