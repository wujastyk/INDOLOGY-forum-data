Dear Matthew and all,

You were not asking about English translations of the *Trisvabh?vanirde?a*,
but I will nonetheless list the eight that I know of, in case you or anyone
else knows of any other one(s). Also, regarding Sanskrit editions of the
*Trisvabh?va-nirde?a*, I have never been able to obtain the first one ever
published, edited by Susumu Yamaguchi. It is said to be in Sh?ky? Kenky?,
volume 8, March-May 1931, pp. 121-130, 186-207. One of the few complete
sets of this journal found in the U.S.A. is at the University of Wisconsin
library. I have checked this volume in person on two or three different
occasions, and did not find it there. I do not know what I am doing wrong
(I do not know any Japanese). I do have Yamaguchi's revised 1972 edition,
but would still like to get his original 1931 edition.
