Sorry, there was a typo in the subject line. It should have been BhP 10.33.31.

Based on the commentaries for this verse and succeeding verses, it is clear that by the word ???vara? the text refers to a devotee of K???a. This usage of '??vara? to refer to a devotee seems to be a clear case of translation of the Tamil word ???v?r? as used in Tamil texts and inscriptions. Synonyms of ??v?r are also used to refer to both the devotees and the deities in the Tamil tradition. For instance the deity in the temple at Tanjore is called B?had??vara in Sanskrit and Peruvu?aiy?r in Tamil. Here Sanskrit ??vara is synonymous with Tamil u?aiy?r. Interestingly, R?m?nuja is called U?aiyavar (an alternate form of U?aiy?r) in the Tamil tradition.
