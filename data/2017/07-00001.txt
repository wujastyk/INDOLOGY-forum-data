Subject: [INDOLOGY] Question on the word "purapati"

Dear list,

Thanks for your response to my question on Indology.  Having seen the
Sircar definition of purapati, my question was really about what it would
mean to be the "mayor" of Delhi in the Sultanate period. If the patron on
this inscription, U??hara, was a purapati during the reign of Ghiyath
ud-D?n Balban, would that make him a sort of government functionary in the
Sultanate? What is the remit of a purapati? Also what valence does the term
Yogin?pura have? It is used twice in conjunction with Delhi in
Jonar?ja?s *R?jatara?gi??.
 C*ompleted in 1459, it speaks of the citizens of Yogin?pura (
*yogin?purapaura*) in verse 381 ?lord of Yogin?pura? (*yogin?puran?tha*) in
verse 441. Both of these references come during the account of the Ka?m?r?
Sultan Shi??b ad-Din, who reigned from 1355-1373.

Thanks again for your responses, and I appreciate any thoughts!

Best,

Luther
