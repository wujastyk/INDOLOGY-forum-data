[INDOLOGY] Sanskrit literature in numbers
Dear Dagmar,
This is a very interesting question indeed. May I add two other questions to it? Would you like to know the numbers of extant works only or the number of works in general, even if lost? Also, when you write Latin language, for instance, do you mean only classical Latin (whatever this might mean) or every work that has been written in Latin until today (and I?m not thinking of today?s Latin used in the Vatican, I was rather thinking of authors like the Italian poet Giovanni Pascoli (1855 ?1912), who wrote poems in Latin too)?
Best wishes,

[INDOLOGY] Sanskrit literature in numbers
Dear colleagues,
Might anyone be able to point me to a publication/data on the relative quantities of Sanskrit works and other pre-modern works in languages such as Latin, Chinese, Tamil, Arabic or Persian?
We all know that there is a very large body of Sanskrit literature, but how does the number of Sanskrit works compare to works written in other languages? My sense has always been that Sanskrit literature is particularly large, but perhaps this is not substantiated by data?
Best wishes,
Dagmar Wujastyk
