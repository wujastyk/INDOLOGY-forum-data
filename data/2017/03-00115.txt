Dear indologists,

Publicly using this forum to request a free PDF of book published by a
university press just a decade ago is not all right.  Please buy the books
you need, or ask your university library to get them.

Please respect the law of copyright, at least in the broadest terms.

This forum is a good place to ask for old rare or difficult-to-get items,
once one has exhausted the resources of Archive.org (now including the
DLI), Google Books, Hathi Trust, etc.

With thanks,
Dominik Wujastyk
INDOLOGY committee member
