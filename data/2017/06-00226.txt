[INDOLOGY] MR Kale biodata
Dear Jesse, Mrinal and all,
I have often wondered it (and in fact been quite annoyed): Everybody uses Kales works, but nobody knows anything on him. I have not even found the dates of the birth and death of More?var R?mcandra K?le. In his books he is styled B.A., in 1911/24 he was living in Girgaon and had a son, V. M. Kale, who published new editions of his father?s works. This is all! I really hope someone can give more information.
Karmarkar is easier. There are two obituary notices, by A. D. Pusalker, ABORI 46, 1965, 191f. and V. M. Bedekar, VIJ 4, 1966, 89-91 giving the basic information about the career of this Poona scholar.
Best,
Klaus
