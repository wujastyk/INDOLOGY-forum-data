[INDOLOGY] a question regarding the usage of -gotra versus -sagotra
all gotras should be added sa
bhaardhvaaj sagotra etc.
 Charudeva Shastry uses it every where. This rule is said in Grhya sutra
etc, I don't remember right now. I will send reference later. But every
gotra is added sa and not only few.
