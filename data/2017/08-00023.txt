[INDOLOGY] New IAST keyboard layout for Linux
Dear colleagues,
Those of you who use Linux (or are considering making the switch), may 
like to know about a new keyboard layout I created for the X keyboard 
system.  It is based on, and works just like, Toshiya Unebe?s extremely 
convenient ?EasyUnicode? keyboard layout for OSX.
Details are here:
