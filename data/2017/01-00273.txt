Dear Nagaraj,

Many thanks for pointing out the usage of mudr??kita, it is a very useful reference that confirms the specific use of this term for the preparation of stones for printing in lithography and for typesetting with movable types.

Best wishes,

Camillo

There are words like mudrAnkita mudrA =stamp, ankita = past participle of mark making with the help of mudrA ; This is helpful in the case of typeset

ankita  , independently can mean mark-making as in lithography, preparing stones for printing.

mudrAnkita is part of mAdhva religious vocabulary, indicating the initiation ritual of stamping s'ankha and chakra on the temples of the initiated.

Dear Nagaraj (if I may),

Many thanks for the reply. The reason why I have translated a?kita as 'printed' is precisely because I understood it the same way you did. However, if you read it in the context of the colophon of the lithography and in the whole context of the incunabulum of the Kir?t?rjun?ya, you might wonder whether it also encompasses the more technical meaning of preparing the stones for printing, in case of the lithography, or also typeset, in case of the incunabulum.

The term a?kita obviously means "printed," but does it also include the other two aspects of the process of printing? I believe that this is a legitimate question and not at all obvious.

Best wishes,

Camillo

anka = mark , anka-karaNa = mark-making, mark-creating ankita - past participle of anka

should not be surprising to give the meaning of printing

Dear Dominik,

Many thanks for this list, it is very helpful!

I would add the following two terms:

yantra, printing press

a?kita, printed (or typeset?)

I'm not sure about the last one, actually printed should be mudrita, but since the term a?kita occurs both in the title page of the 1814 Calcutta (Khidirapura) edition of Bh?ravi?s Kir?t?rjun?ya with Mallin?tha?s commentary printed with movable types, as well as in the colophon of an 1861 lithography of the ??drakamal?kara, I believe it ought to mean printed.

I briefly discuss the term in my 2016 article on Sanskrit print, but leaving a question mark about the meaning. I would be grateful if any of you has a suggestion as to the meaning of this term.

Best wishes,

Camillo
