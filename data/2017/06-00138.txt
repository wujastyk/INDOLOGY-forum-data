[INDOLOGY] McCone article request
Dear Jesse, Dear All,?? For the sake of information, I may mention that Kim McCone has later withdrawn this etymoclogical connection between Ved. brahman- and?the Old Irish noun broimm, see the account provided in my paper (to be attached), in Vedic S?kh?s (proceedings of the Vedic Workshop, Bucharest, 2012), ed. J. Houben, J. Rotaru, M. Witzel, Harvard University Press, 2016, p. 1000 n. 40. This does not hold in the eye of Celtologists, not to speak of other Indo-Europeanists. By the way, this paper of mine contains also an up-to-date bibliography about Ved. brahman- and related issues.
Best regards,??? Georges-Jean Pinault

Dear Friends, Would one of you be so kind as to provide the following provocative 3-page article below. It seems that not all jstor subscriptions are equal. It is on jstor, but our budget version doesn't give access.
