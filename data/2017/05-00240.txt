If my recollection is correct, M. Eliade had a great deal on dhyAna in his book on Yoga.
I recall, too, that Richard Gombrich reviewed the English version, when it appeared,
very harshly for its (mis)treatment of Buddhist materials. So it should be used cautiously.
However, because the range of reference is broad, it may point in some worthwhile
directions nevertheless.
