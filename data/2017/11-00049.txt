[INDOLOGY] Sources on Relationship btw Oral/Literary Traditions
Dear List members,
I am not sure if it is relevant to the topic at hand, but in the introductions of, for instance, the Har?acarita, Raghuva??a and the Sanskrit plays the respective authors of the texts play with the idea of live performances of royal panegyric, va??as and dramas (see my "On Beginnings: Introductions and Prefaces in K?vya", in: Bronner-Shulman-Tubb, Innovations and Turningpoints, Oxford-Delhi 2014, pp. 86-108).

It is Lauri Honko, the Finnish Folklorist who uses the word "textualization" in the sense of bringing an oral text into a written form:
