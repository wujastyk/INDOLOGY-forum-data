Dear scholars,

?
Taptamudra
? ?
is considered as
? ?
one of the five
? parts of

vai??avad?k?? (b
*?hya)*. It is referred in the following texts -

   1.
*V?ddha-h?r?ta-sm?ti (2nd Chapter) *
   2. Vi??u-rahasya (7th Chapter)
   3. Cakra-m?m??s? by Vijay?ndrat?rtha
   4. Sanaka-sm?ti (vi??ornuketi mantre?a t?payitv? sudar?anam .....)
   5. P?dma-sm?ti
   6. G?ru?a-sm?ti
   7. N?rada-sm?ti
   8. Vihage?vara-sa?hit?
   9. Yukti-mallik? of ?r?v?dir?ja (Phalasaurabha, 578 to 650verses)
   10. K????c?rya's Sm?ti-mukt?val? (While discussing Upanayana-sa?sk?ra )
   11. Skanda-pur??a (Vai??avakha??a)


?I found all the above information from Prof Sagri Raghavendra Upadhyaya, a
renowned Dvaita, Dharmashastra and Purana scholar from Udupi region.
 He has his own publishing house (Paravidy? Prak??ana) and published more
than
 50 books.
 One of his work titled
? ?
V
*ai??avad?k?e? ?*
[Kannada work] is the source for all these information.


I hope this helps.

Thank you.
