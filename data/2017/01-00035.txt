The judgment, "the pot is not on the ground" seems to indicate that 
there is no pot on the ground in the present moment. What type of an 
absence is in question would, I would guess, depend on whether a pot has 
been on that particular piece of ground before or not, and whether one 
will be there in the future. The point of the r?pa/v?yu example is that 
the wind will _never_ have any colour trope.

The Ny?yasiddh?ntamukt?val? also interprets it as temporal rather than 
spatial: nityasa?sarg?bh?vatvam atyant?bh?vatvam. The term "atyanta" 
does not suggest that it is absent from all locations, but that is 
_permanently_ absent from a particular location/set of locations. What 
you have in mind would perhaps correspond to Vy?sat?rtha's definition of 
nonexistence (asattva) in the Ny?y?m?ta. He asattva as "being the 
counterpositive of an omnispatiotemporal absence" 
(trik?lasarvade??yani?edh?praityogit? / sattocyate 'dhyastatucche ta? 
prati pratiyogin?).

What is wrong with the translation "colour" for the term r?pa as it is 
used in Vai?e?ika texts? In the classical Vai?e?ika scheme, r?pa is a 
sort of gu?a (i.e. a non?repeatable property particular). Modern 
translators generally use "colour" to translate this concept (understood 
as referring to a _particular shade_ of dark blue, a _particular 
manifestation_ of the variegated colour?if one believes in it?etc.) See 
Potter's translation of Raghun?tha's Pad?rthatattvanir?pa?a for the 
absence of colour-tropes in the wind (pp.35?38) and pp.45?46 for a 
discussion of the citrar?pa.

Best regards,

Mike
