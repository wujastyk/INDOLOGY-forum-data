[INDOLOGY] Buddhasrijnana's Abhisamaya commentary
Dear David,
"when you refer to Buddha?r?j??na's commentary, the Praj??prad?p?val?, you
are apparently referring to Tohoku no. 3800. But you seem to be saying that
the Sanskrit manuscript is actually of a portion of a different
Praj??prad?p?val? commentary, one by J??nap?da?"
Indeed, the situation is somewhat bizarre. We have two works called
Praj??prad?p?val? by two authors called Buddha?r?j??na. The first,
(probably) written by THE J??nap?da is what we have in the Sanskrit
fragment on Sankrtyayan's photographs and thus Enoo's edition (which indeed
is a commentary on ASA ch. 8 - and the post-verses if you can call them
that 9.1-2). This I cannot trace in Tibetan. The second is T?hoku no. 3800,
which is by the later Buddha?r?j??na (12th c. or so?), for which we do not
have the Sanskrit. It's strange, but there we are.
Yours,
Peter
