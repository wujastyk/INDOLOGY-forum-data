The role of the GG in the birth of the Kathakali genre in Kerala is a discussed matter. Quoting Rich Freeman (?Genre and Society: The Literary  Culture of Premodern Kerala?, in Pollock ed. 2003, p. 487):
?While the form of th[e] original Sanskrit work itself has suggested that it was a performed piece, it was certainly put to this function in Kerala, where the work was known as the A??apadi. It was apparently adopted in this form by the kings of Calicut for performance in the Guruv?y?r and other K???a temples, where it developed from songs sung by temple servants before the stairs leading to the sanctum (hence, stair-song, s?p?na-g?ti) into a performance genre called a??apadiy???am (dancing of the A??apadi) presented by C?ky?rs using the gestural language (mudra) adapted from the theater. The best guess is that this genre was developed in the fifteenth or sixteenth centuries, when the Caitanya movement in Bengal (which had direct ties to south India) may have given an impetus to the K???a cult in Kerala.? [or a new impetus, since there was already in Kerala a strong K???a cult and lyrico-devotional tradition, with Bilvamangala etc., from which Caitanya himself borrowed a lot].
At the least the GG has clearly influenced the K???ag?ti, a lyrico-dramatic poem written by M?naveda (a Zamorin of Calicut) in 1652 (cf. for the dating chronogram, Kunjunni Raja, CSKL p. 102) which became the source-text for the K??????am, a special dance-drama (different from the R?ma????am viewed as the more direct predecessor of the Kathakali in the same 17th century).
It is to be noted that a verse form the GG is always sung at the beginning of a Kathakali performance as an auspicious ritual (see Paul Martin-Dubost, Le Th??tre dans? du K?rala, Paris, 1990, pp. 103-123).
The earliest translation of the GG in Malayalam seems the Bh?????apadi, by the poet R?mapurattu V?ryar (1703-1753).
