[INDOLOGY] Buddhavacanam
Dear David,
Thanks, but the attached scan only seems to have the first 1 1/2 pages of the article. Would it be possible to resend the whole article?
Best Wishes,

The article that Stella referred to seemed to be of interest to several people here (including myself). I have now gotten to a library and photocopied it. A scan of it in PDF is attached.

I cannot provide the article right now, but the point Prof. Smith was making  was that
the Buddha wasn't talking about languages at all. He was mainly saying the his disciples and followers should
render his words as they were spoken by him and refrain from all interpretations, additions, 'explanations'  etc.
It is quite a sensible point in my view. And it makes all discussion about what language the Buddha himself actually
spoke rather irrelevant, however interesting per se.

P.S. I'll get the article in question when I can go in to the library.

Re: [INDOLOGY]  quote search
The most original interpretation of this famous passage is by the late Ronald Morton Smith.
"What Was One's Own Language? Vinaya 2.139". The article can be found in
Contacts between Cultures: South Asia 2 (Selected Papers  from the 33rd International Congress
of Asian and North African  Studies (Toronto, Aigust 15-25, 1990). Ed. by  K.L. Koppedrayer,
Lewiston 1992, pp, 240-241
