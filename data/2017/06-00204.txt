[INDOLOGY] Fwd: Re:  Sanskrit Readers: overview
There is also Christian Lassen's /Anthologia Sanscritica Glossario 
Instructa in Usum Scholarum/, Bonn, Marcus, 1868, which bills itself a 
second, augmented edition of an anthology by the same title by Joannes 
Gildemeister.  Lassen's is in archive.org and Hathi Trust, but I am 
unable to find the first edition by Gildemeister, which does not appear 
in WorldCat.

	Re: [INDOLOGY] Sanskrit Readers: overview
Here is the reader I grew up on at the University of Brussels:
Thumb, Albert, /Handbuch des Sanskrit, /II. Teil: /Texte und Glossar 
/von Richard Hauschild, Heidelberg, Carl Winter, 1953.
It fits in the category of general readers.
Best wishes,
