Dear Friends, I labored over my first attempt at a ?loka (shared below) for
several hours, partly inspired by Madhav Deshpande's lovely poems, partly
probably by something funny that I ate. Finally I dared to share it with
Madhav-mahodaya and he gave me some crucial help with p?da c. Then I shared
it with Arindam Chakrabarty who wrote a very clever response. Finally
Madhav-mahodaya himself wrote a concluding verse. Here are the three for
your holiday entertainment:
