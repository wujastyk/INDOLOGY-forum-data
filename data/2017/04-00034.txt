Dear Jesse,

I don?t know if anybody has already pointed out this Italian translation, but just to be on the safe side:

Gitagovinda, o il canto del Pastore / idillio di Jayadeva ; tradotto dal sanscrito da Emilio Pinna
                Pubblicazione    Firenze : B. Seeber, 1913
                Descrizione fisica              142 p. ; 20 cm.

Best wishes,

Camillo

Wow this is so fascinating. Thanks so much to you, Csaba, and Judit Torzok for sharing this information with us.

To expand on Csaba's message below: the Hungarian translation is online at https://terebess.hu/keletkultinfo/dzsajadeva.html

According to an anecdote, Indian listeners could recognise the G?tagovinda when they heard parts of this recited in Hungarian. It is indeed a brilliant work of translation that matches the original metres with an accuracy I'd estimate over 95%, and more with some licence. It also reproduces almost all of the rhyme/anupr?sa in the songs. That said, the transcreation is far from accurate content-wise, and Vekerdi remained at odds with We?res ever after.

Dear Jesse,

Do Ugric languages count? There is a brilliant metrical Hungarian translation, a collaborative effort of the Sanskritist J?zsef Vekerdi, who made a prose translation from the Sanskrit and of the poet S?ndor We?res who versified it.

Dzsajad?va, G?ta Govinda. P?sztor?nek. Magvet?, Budapest, 1982.

Best,
Csaba

Can anyone tell me if the 12th/13th century Sanskrit poem G?tagovinda has been translated into any Slavic or east Asian languages? or any other languages that people might be less commonly aware of? Latin, French, Italian, Spanish, German, English, etc. accounted for. Best, ??????,J --
