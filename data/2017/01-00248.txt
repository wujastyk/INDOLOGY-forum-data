Subject: [INDOLOGY] Skt vocabulary from the title pages and prefaces of Sanskrit editions
In-Reply-To: <CAKdt-CdgGDXcZ=GM5ScbQYuAdWyR6PBemQnrNdOVVrwHph_1rw@mail.gmail.com>
Message-ID: <CADKD_ziXW6mzoVLu=Bu6DTpwed+PL0cFGxkWNTiyTG5j-NMYDA@mail.gmail.com>

Not in the preface but the *?uddhipattram *(errata list) can sometimes be a
helpful term to be familiar with when using Sanskrit editions.

Best wishes,
Charles
