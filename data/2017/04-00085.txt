Subject: [INDOLOGY] Inability to see romanised (transliterated text with diacritics) Sanskrit in my emails.

Thank you all for your suggestions. I think this may well be a problem with
the way my email client (gmail) deals with UTF* and MIME. I think I will
just follow Dominik's solution of switching to individual message for now.

Best

AJ
