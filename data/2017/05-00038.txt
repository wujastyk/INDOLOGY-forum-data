Kindly see the following call for papers for the University of Toronto?s Graduate Conference on South Asian Religions and feel free to circulate widely.

The Department for the Study of Religion at the University of Toronto is pleased to announce the Fourth Biennial Graduate Conference on South Asian Religions (GCSAR) held on October 5th & 6th, 2017.

We are delighted to welcome Dr. Rosalind O?Hanlon, Professor of Indian History and Culture, Faculty of Oriental Studies, University of Oxford, and Dr. Kristin Scheible, Associate Professor of Religion at Reed College, Oregon, as this year?s keynote speakers.

Additionally, the GCSAR together with the Department of History will host a roundtable discussion with Dr. Shahid Amin, Dr. Rosalind O?Hanlon, and Dr. Natalie Zemon Davis on questions of historical memory.

Graduate students engaged in original research from disciplines including, but not limited to, religious studies, women?s and gender studies, philosophy, anthropology, history, linguistics, sociology, area or diasporic studies, political science, and geography are encouraged to apply. As an inherently interdisciplinary conference, we endeavour to stimulate critical and scholastically rigorous conversations across historical periods, methodologies, and subject matter. As such, we encourage submissions from graduate students working on Islam, Sikhism, Jainism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Judaism, Christianity, and Zoroastrianism. Participants will deliver a 20 minute paper before an audience of students and faculty from the University of Toronto.

Individual papers as well as full panel proposals will be accepted. Please send the following material to southasianreligionsatutoronto at gmail.com<mailto:southasianreligionsatutoronto at gmail.com> by June 1, 2017:

Individual Papers?350-word paper abstract; 5 keywords describing the paper; CV

Panels?250-word panel abstract; 5 keywords describing each paper; 350-word paper abstracts; Member CVs.

Decisions will be communicated by July 1, 2017.

Although limited funding is available for students to defray travel costs and lodging, all presenters are encouraged to seek funding from their home institutions.
