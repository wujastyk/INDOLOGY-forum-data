If you would consider a request to members, I wanted to ask the following
question.
As I mentioned, I am researching mangoes - as a cultural matter of taste.
One of the first things I'm setting out to do is learn as much as possible
about mangoes in Indian history or philosophy or travelogue,  or any texts.
I wished to explore mangoes as metaphor, as ingredient, as mudra or prose.
It would be so great to ask this forum about references and reading I can
start with! Naresh Keerthi who recommends that I ask the forum has already
pointed me towards Pampa mahakavi.
Thanks ever so much.
