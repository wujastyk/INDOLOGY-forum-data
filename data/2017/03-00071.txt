Dear Herman,
Here are the answers, as far as I know.
1. Tolk?ppiyar does not discuss the morphophonemics of vi?aittokai. The closest someone comes to discussing it indirectly is in Na???l (165), where the commentators discuss examples like k?ppukaram and n???upuka? as instances, where the plosives do not double. See http://www.tamilvu.org/courses/degree/c021/c0214/html/c0214662.htm <http://www.tamilvu.org/courses/degree/c021/c0214/html/c0214662.htm> for a modern text giving the rule regarding vi?aittokai.
2. & 4. The meaning of itai can be gathered from Akam 140. Here we have ?itai muyal pu?ava? pukai? referring to the smoke arising from the person of the upland working to make itai. He is obviously engaged in slash-and-burn mode of cultivation. So the meaning of ?newly cultivated field? for itai is justified. Over time, plants that are grown in the field such as Chowlee-bean or Italian millet might have come to be called ?itai? by metonymy and found their way into dictionary. 
3. Because of above, the dictionary meaning is justified.
5. I presume the critical edition is going to be published by IFP/EFEO. I would like to know how the recent Akan????u translation by George Hart published by IFP/EFEO handles these occurrences in Akam 140 and 394?
