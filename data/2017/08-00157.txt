Subject: [INDOLOGY] Rahul Sankrityayan's recordings of Sanskrit and Prakrit literature
Message-ID: <CAANHO173hciaCEKLsjjdKtN9w+=27BYWT5Fo0PzF=q53J7ew2A@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list members,

I've come across a reference, in Alaka Atreya Chudal's book on Rahul
Sankrityayan, to recordings of Sanskrit and Prakrit texts (Artha??stra,
Nalop?khy?na, Setubandha, etc.) that the Mahapandit made while he was a
professor at Leningrad University (1945-1947). These recordings were
evidently available some decades afterwards in "the acoustics room at the
university," according to V. I. Kalianov. I've written to the institutions
at St. Petersburg that might know of the current whereabouts of these
recordings, but I thought that I would ask all of you if you have any
further information, especially since Sankrityayan is a relatively frequent
topic of conversation on this list. It would be great to put those
recordings online.

I should also take the opportunity to ask whether any of you are aware of
any other recordings of Prakrit literature. I was surprised to see the
Setubandha in the list, since I know of many fine recordings of classical
Sanskrit and Kannada texts, but haven't yet found anything comparable for
Prakrit texts.

Andrew
