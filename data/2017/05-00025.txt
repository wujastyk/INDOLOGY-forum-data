Dear colleagues,

Is anyone aware of a publication that addresses the etymology or use of the
term pu?pik?/pu?pak? as a closing formula of a text or manuscript? This
meaning is not attested in pre-modern North Indian vernaculars, and appears
to enter Hindi in the twentieth century via Sanskrit lexicography (i.e.
Syamsundardas, author of the *Hind? ?abda S?gara, *appears to have copied
his entry for puspik? from Monier-Williams's dictionary). I've checked a
few sources on codicology that use the term, but they give no information
on the term itself.

With thanks,
