Dear Friends, You might have guessed that I'm working on annotated GG
bibliography. The task started out as slightly tedious, but has become very
rewarding and pleasurable thanks to your help.
I also welcome any references to lesser known articles and works you might
know of. I look forward to sharing the bibliography with you when it's done.
A propos would anyone have a soft copy of the following?
Sarkar, Ranajit (1974). *Gi?tagovinda : towards a total understanding*.
Rijksuniversiteit te Groningen, [Institute of Indian Studies], Groningen,
[Netherlands]


Thanks ??????,j
