AJIS invites academic papers on all aspects of Indic studies broadly
defined for publication in Volume 1 Number 1 and its subsequent issues. AJIS
publishes papers that call attention to the meanings and applications of
Indic categories, which have typically been under-represented in the
academic study of Indic civilization. AJIS invites papers that analyze
specific theoretical and methodological issues within Indic studies across
academic disciplines. AJIS also welcomes papers that place Indic categories
and explanatory models in conversation with western theoretical and
methodological models in order to deepen and expand scholarly knowledge of
Indic civilization. Interactions and relationships of western and
non-western studies on contemporary and classical Indic civilization are
also considered for publication.



Papers on all aspects of Indic Studies, and their interdisciplinary studies
in all of the disciplines of Humanities, Social Sciences, Education, Public
Affairs, and other Interdisciplinary areas including (but not limited
to) Anthropology,
Archaeology, Arts and Art History, Diaspora Studies, Ethical Thought,
Ecological & Environmental Studies, Film Studies, Gender Studies, History &
Culture, Human Geography, India-America relations, Indic Elements &
Hindu-Buddhist relations in Asia, Languages & Linguistics, Media Studies,
Philosophy, Politics & Public Administration, Religious Studies, Social
Work, and Sociology will be considered for publication.



American Journal of Indic Studies publishes original papers, reflection
papers, theoretical & conceptual frameworks, analytical & empirical
research, applied research & field notes, and book & film reviews.
