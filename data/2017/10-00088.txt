Dear list members,

Dr. Ganesan of the I.F.P. brought it to my attention that the the Shaivite
Paper Transcripts of the  French Institute of Pondicherry in the Muktabodha
digital library have been inaccessable for several weeks.  Our webhost
moved our domain to a different server and this caused the problem.

Thanks,
Harry Spier
