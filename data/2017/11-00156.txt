Subject: [INDOLOGY] Myth of the King Whose Fame Faded
Message-ID: <F38CF132-3F7E-4D8C-BF82-E3037B6CC5E6@ohio.edu>

Dear List,

I read a story in the epics or puranas about a king kicked out of heaven because his fame on earth had faded and he had to go find a living person who remembered his name in order to be let back in. Unfortunately, that person was not me because I can?t remember his name either. Does anyone remember where to find this story?

Thanks,

Brian
