1. Non-violence in Vedic tradition being independent of Buddhism / Jainism
should not be surprising because expressions of non-violence or expressions
such as "Ye, don't commit violence against...." are part of mantras of
Rigveda and Yajurveda themselves. There are several mantras ending in ??
???????



2. But the characteristic of Vedic tradition which baffles a non-discerning
observer is the thriving of its ideal of non-violence  always alongside its
allowance to harm, kill, punish etc. There are Vedic mantras instructing to
harm/kill harmful entities. Some mantras express a wish for courage,
strength to succeed in such harming/ killing / punishing.



That one way of looking at 'non-violence' is to save entities vulnerable to
violence from such violence by resorting to violence against those
committing violence against such vulnerable creatures is a subtle
understanding of non-violence inherent in the Vedic world-view. ???????? or
?????????? is an agent of such non-violence (no violence against the weak /
vulnerable).



3. It is this subtle understanding of violence and /or non-violence rooted
in the Vedic tradition right from the Veda mantras that is inherent in
Mahabharata that fails a superficial reader of it in understanding the
congruence of ?????? ???? ????? with the remaining parts of the book that
make the book appear to be a book of war.



4. Let us take the portions of the book that can not but be integral to the
book and see if they have vegetarianism and non-violence.



One such portion is  ???????? , ???????????????? ? It can not but be
integral to the book because it provides the source of the name of the book
itself. It is the story of the birth of the ???????? of the ??? after which
the book is named. The book or at least its early chapter is a ????????? and
is structured as such. Within that ????????? , this portion is the most
vital one because it is the story of the birth of the ???????? of the ??? after
which the book is named.



Now, in that story, one of the most significant characters is ???? ???????



???? is described in that narrative as a vegetarian, non-violent sage.



His non-violence is indicated through the description:



???? ??????????????????????????????????? ?? ||??||



He (Dushyanta) was pleased to see even wild animals being mild (gentle)
there (in Kanva's ashram)



Entire ashram is described in detail. Not even a single violent activity is
described. Shaastras studied there are described.



in detail. None of them is a shaastra related to wars or such violent
activities.



When asked about Kanva, Shakuntala says,



??? ???? ?? ??????????????????????????? | ???????? ??????????????
????????????????????? ||?||



Bharata growing on that campus, is described as



?????????? ???? |

??????? ?? ???? ? ???????????? ????? | ?????????????????????????? ???????
??????????? ||?|| ??????? ???????? ????????????? ??????? | ???????????????
????????? ???????? ||?||



This violence by Bharata is not condemned by the extremely non-violent
sages there.





Moreover they praised him for the valour and gave the title Sarvadamana to
him.



??????? ??? ????????? ????????????????? | ???????? ???????? ????? ??
????????? ||?||



Why did Dushyanta go there? For the violent activity of hunting.



But he showed extreme respect towards the extremely non-violent sages lead
by Kanva.



Non-violent sages encouraged violent Bharata and violent Dushyanta showed
utmost respect for the non-violent sages.



(to be continued)



Why non-violent sages encouraged violent Bharata?



Since ???????? or ?????????? as an agent of such non-violence (no violence
against the weak / vulnerable), needs valour.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



One of the most prominent faces of movements of non-violent movements and
environmentalist movements today is the anti-war philosophy.



Is Mahabharata an anti-war book?



What is the angirasa of Mahabharata according to Anandavardhana?



??nta.



What is the sth?y?bh?va of ??nta?



nirv?da or ?ama.



What does that mean?



Aanandavardhanaachaarya of 9th century AD read the book as the one with
vair?gya as the central emotion, not as a book of war and violence.



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Is there an internal evidence in the book for the view that the book is an
anti-war book?



What is the udy?ga (effort) in udy?gaparva?



The parva has simultaneous efforts of preparation for war and prevention of
war.



Let us take bhagavady?naparva portion of udy?gaparva.



There is a huge anti-war portion of  the lecture by Yudhi??hira here.



?????? ????? ??????????? ??????? ??????? ?????? |

-------------------------------- ||??||



--------------------------------

--------------------------------



??? ???? ???????? ?????????? ??????? |

???? ????????? ??????? ?????? ???????? ||??||

????????? ?????? ????? ??????? ??????? | ?????????? ???? ????? ?? ??????? ||
??||



and so on.



Does this mean that the entire discussion is anti-war? There is a long
debate back and forth for and against war in this episode. Among many
arguments offered in justification of war, the one that repeatedly crops up
is the justifiability of punishment to the offenders of Draupadi.



Then what is the whole context of the anti-war talk ?



The line of argument in all the lectures including that of Sri Krishna is
that to prevent war is the foremost priority as per Dharma. But to allow
the villains to grab the portion of kingdom even after the condition of
vanav?sa and aj??tav?sa is fulfilled is also not Dharma. After all the
Dharmas are balanced, the net result is that war should be executed only as
the last resort only after exhausting all the options available for
preventing the war .



This priority for prevention of war is what is being highlighted here as
part of the discussion on non-violence.
