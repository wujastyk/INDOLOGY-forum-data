[INDOLOGY] My Sanskrit rendering of Goethe's poem on Shakuntala
Dear Professor Slaje,
     Thank you so much for this clarification, which I did not detect due
to my insufficient knowledge of German.  I gladly accept your suggestion to
change ?? ???????? to ?? ???????? in my Sanskrit rendering.  With best
wishes,
