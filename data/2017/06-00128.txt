[INDOLOGY] Andhra toponymy
Search for Chikkulla Agraharam yielded :
426. Like in Kanchipuram, in the 6th Century itself the Kings of the Telugu
speaking lands had cared for and nurtured such Gatikas. There were such
Gatikas on the banks of Godavari River. In Tuni Taluqa, in a place known as
Chikkulla Agraharam, while digging for a pond, a copper plate Saasanam was
found. It was mentioning about a Vikramendra Varma II of Vishnu Kuntina
Vamsa or dynasty, who accumulated a lot of meritorious PuNya (merits as
opposed to Sins), by establishing proper facilities for a Gatika; Quote,
?yataa vidhi vinirmapita katika vaapta puNya sanjayasya? Unquote.
(To be continued.)
Sambhomahadeva.
