Research Professorship in Digital and Computational Humanities applied to
Ancient Writing
The research professor is expected to combine philological expertise and
computer science proficiency concerning ancient writing on the highest
level, in order to develop research and teaching activities at the
interface between the fundamental sciences of writing (such as, e.g.,
paleography, epigraphy, codicology), the digital humanities and the
computer sciences. He will apply these to domains such as, e.g.,
paleography, the production and (semi-)automatic exploitation of digital
data, and/or their indexation, classification, and analysis, including in
the relevant algorithmic dimensions. The applicant will have strong
experience in concrete technical applications as well as in fundamental
theoretical conceptualization, epistemology and hermeneutics.
The research professor will develop teaching activities in direct relation
to her own research, exposing students to her research as it is being done.
Simultaneously she will participate in transverse teaching projects (in
particular PSL?s new masters programme in digital and computational
humanities) and transverse research projects. She will reinforce the links
between the diverse specialized fields pertaining to the study of ancient
writing, as well as between the fundamental sciences of writing, the
computer sciences, and the cognitive sciences. She is also expected to take
a leading role in conceiving major collective research projects of the EPHE
and/or PSL (ERC, H2020, etc).
Upon recruitment, the research professor will be associated with one of
EPHE?s research teams (e.g., Proclac, Saprat).

L?enseignement est donn? en fran?ais, ? Paris, dans le cadre de l?Ecole
Doctorale 472 de l?EPHE.
