Message-ID: <CAODNnZi182SMj1_d8DCEGrNMjLAYZiK0rjVDZ322Cv9KVNJW0Q@mail.gmail.com>

Dear friends

I am trying to find the MSS Oxf. 156b. which is the details
 of Vasavadata- Jagaddhara commentary

Abbreviated list shows for ' Oxf' is

" Catalogus Codicum Sanscriticorum Bibliothecae Bodeleianne, Compiled by
Th. Aufret, Oxford, 1864.

I don't know how exactly do I proceed to procure the Manuscripts.

Any pointers will be highly admired.
