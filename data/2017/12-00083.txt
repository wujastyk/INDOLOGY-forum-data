[INDOLOGY] Price tag on 19th-cent. print
Thanks to Royce, Dominik, and Jean Michel for responding to my query. 
The numbering system provided by Dominik would seem to explain the 
symbols in the example provided by Royce: ??||) would equal 45 rupees 
and 8 annas, and ??|||) would equal 22 rupees and 12 annas. In both 
cases, this is confirmed by the text added after the numerals.
The example provided by myself is still not clear to me, but I will look 
up the sources provided by Dominik and Jean Michel, and see if they can 
help me further along.
Best regards,
Jacob
