Excellent article from Sadhana (www.sadhana.org <http://www.sadhana.org/>)! Thank you for sharing!

The 'caste and untouchability? issue is monstrous in S.India. Numerous families are devastated.

I hope people get enlightened soon. How long do we have to wait for the Kalki-avatar???

Thanks and regards,
rajam
