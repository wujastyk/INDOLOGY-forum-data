[INDOLOGY] A Hindu Apology for Caste and Untouchability
Excellent article from Sadhana (www.sadhana.org <http://www.sadhana.org/>)! Thank you for sharing!
The 'caste and untouchability? issue is monstrous in S.India. Numerous families are devastated.
I hope people get enlightened soon. How long do we have to wait for the Kalki-avatar???
Thanks and regards,
