[INDOLOGY] Grantha/South Indian Paleography Resources?
Dear Friends and Colleagues,
Might anyone suggest a good paleographical resource for manuscripts in
Grantha script (as well as other scripts used in Sanskrit (or Tamil and
Telugu) manuscripts produced in the South)? I'm presently making use
of Bu?hler's Indische Palaeographie and any other resources would be much
appreciated.
Thanks in advance,
Charles
