[INDOLOGY] pre-lined mss.
Dear P?ter-D?niel,
In the northwest (Rajasthan and Gujarat) one finds wooden boards with
raised ridges, into which paper folios were pressed to leave indentations,
rather like a watermark. These were used in particular by Jains who, as JP
Losty has suggested, seem to have been producing "stereotyped" manuscripts
of some works by the Sultanate period. If I can find one of my photos of
one, I will send it along. These were used in addition to and alongside the
string boards that Dominik has already mentioned.
If one were ever to undertake such a detailed metric study of South Asian
manuscripts as Gordon Proot has done for early European printed materials
<https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Goran_Proot>, then one might be able
to link multiple manuscripts to a single site of production (even despite
multiple scribal hands). I've been toying with the idea of crunching
catalog data on folio sizes and lines per folio in some collections to see
if patterns emerge, but that would be a very rudimentary start.
Best,
Tyler
