[INDOLOGY] Attantya Abhava
 To ALL,
              A very very happy new year to All.
   In the Vaishisheka parlance, Abhava ( i.e.negation) has been classified as- Prag-Abhav, 
Dhangsh-Abhava and Attyanta-Abhava.
           Can anybody suggest an example  of Attyanta Abhava.?
                                                ALAKENDU DAS.
