[INDOLOGY] Accessing Muktabodha Digital Library by users with Mac computers.
Dear list members,
One of the list members has informed me that when he accesses the Gokarna
Vedic Collection of the Muktabodha Digital Library with a Mac and the
Safari browser when he clicks on the pdf link to a manuscript instead of a
pdf file opening with photos of the manuscript he gets gibberish text.
I am able to access the pdf's of the manuscripts with windows with no
problems.
Would it be possible for a list member who has a mac and safari to try to
access pdf's of the Gokarna Vedic collection and tell me if he gets a pdf
of the manuscript or if he also gets gibberish.
The direct link to the Gokarna Vedic collection is:

Thanks,
