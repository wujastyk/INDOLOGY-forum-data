[INDOLOGY] Sanskrit flash cards or lists of vocabulary to build a database?
Dear Dean,
I have flashcards for all the vocabulary from my textbook, as well as for
most declensional forms and sandhi combinations on the brainscape site that
is available here:
http://cambridge-sanskrit.org/other-resources-links/
St James Schools, who teach Sanskrit to secondary-school students, also
have their flash cards on Brainscape:
https://www.brainscape.com/packs/sanskrit-4799882
Accessing them means signing up for a brainscape account, but that is free
and just there so that the site can remember your learning statistics.
All the best,
    Antonia
