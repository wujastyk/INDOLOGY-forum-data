[INDOLOGY] Gita 13.6
Dear HR-ji,
If your question is, " Are the 'Avyakta' of 13.6 and 'Avyakta' of  8.18.
one and the same?",
then the answer is 'No' and 'Yes'
No, because the 'avyakta' of 13.6 is the unmanifest aspect /element of the
creation during the vyakta phase of the creation.
Whereas the  'avyakta' in 8.18 is the avyakta phase of the creation.
Yes, because in 8.18 too 'avyakta is an aspect/dimension. In the avyakta
phase, only avyakta aspect/dimension remains. All elements like Mahabhutani
of 13.6, which exist in a vyakta aspect/dimension of them in the vyakta
phase , change into their avyakta aspect/dimension during the avyakta phase.
