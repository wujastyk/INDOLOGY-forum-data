[INDOLOGY] Tantrismo e cristianesimo
Care friends, dear friends,
the approach may seem reckless (and perhaps it is), but this does not
ignore the conference that will be held at Gregoriana for the entire
day of Tuesday, October 17, with the participation of those who write.
Regarding the (very atypical ...) request of a membership fee of 10
euros, the organizers have decided not to ask for it from the names I
will forward, considering them as "invited". Those aspiring to this
exemption can fill in and send me the following questionnaire:
If you want to send me the details of my guests I can put them as
invited guests so that they will not be asked for their entry fee. The
data I need is as follows:
- Title / assignment (teacher, school leader, etc.):
- Name and surname:
- Place and date of birth:
- Cellphone number:
- Email address:
- Dioceses of belonging (for Catholics):
A good greeting
