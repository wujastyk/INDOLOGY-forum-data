Dear Friends,
I would humbly appreciate input from those who have taught these subjects
to advise what would be a suitable reading material (Sanskrit),
supplementary reference material and course layout for a student who has
completed already 4 years of university Sanskrit so has a competent reading
and grammar capability and would like to do a semester of caraka and one of
p??ini.
With Kindest Wishes,
Martin Gluckman
