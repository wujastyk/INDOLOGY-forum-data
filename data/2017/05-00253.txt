[INDOLOGY] The pre-natal/pre-incarnatory curse in Indian literature
Hi,
Yes, there are many examples. One of the most striking, in my opinion, is the sage Vi?ravas? pre-natal, even pre-conception, curse of R?va?a, Kumbhakar?a and ??rpa?akh? to be monstrous  because their mother-to be, Kaikas?, approached him at a bad time. The sage also  prenatally blesses his future son Vibh??a?a to be virtuous. See the V?lm?ki R?maya?a (critical ed.) 7.9. 10?20.
Of course there innumerable examples of figures being cursed to suffer nasty future births.
