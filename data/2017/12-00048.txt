Also, the last four verses of the Isa that begin with hiranmayena patrena etc. are Brhad-Aranyaka 5.15.1, thus the concluding portion of book 5. Note also that both belong to the White Yajurveda and that the Isa is the last chapter of the Vajasaneyi Samhita (Vajasaneya being a patronymic of Yajnavalkya).
