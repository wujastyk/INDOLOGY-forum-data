Subject: [INDOLOGY] New Online Course: The Science and Practice of Yoga
Message-ID: <CAFZJJzHFT0htWiWLk2ppZLPMb4=a8d_mhd6SmMJULZNUEzHyig@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Colleagues,

Now that the semester has begun to get rolling, I wanted to share with you
a possible resource for you or your students. The University of Texas at
Arlington in conjunction with edX is offering a MOOC (massive open online
course) on ?The Science and Practice of Yoga.?

My understanding is that this course will feature recent research from
scholars of contemplative neuroscience and positive psychology. I am no
neuroscientist, but I have also contributed to the course a short
discussion about the history of yoga and yoga?s relation to some pre-modern
Indian religious traditions.

The course begins on October 16, 2017. It is free for all who wish to
enroll. More information and a button to enroll is here:

All best wishes,
Andrew
