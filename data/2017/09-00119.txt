[INDOLOGY] [Indica et Buddhica] An author-publisher Copyright Licence
Dear Colleagues,
Following on from the recent discussion on publishers agreements ...
My solicitors and patent attorneys have recently finished reviewing the
IeB author-publisher Copyright Licence. We've been trying to make it
reasonable, balanced and fair.
Clause 2.8.1 allows for the distribution of an Open Access PDF. Other
clauses that may be of interest cover the Author's Copyright
(Background, 3, 12 & 13), Royalties (8 & 9), Format and Publishing
Decisions &c. (19 & 20), and the Reversion of Rights (25). Each author
will have different needs so I would also like each licence to be
negotiated project by project.

I would welcome comments so please feel free to mail me off-list.
With best regards,
  Richard
