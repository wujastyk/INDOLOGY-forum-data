Dear All. ? In addition to this reference to Brill's Encyclopedia of Hinduism, I may recommend specifically the two following books (which are most probably part of the bibliography of BEH): Kevin McGrath, Stri. Women in Epic Mah?bh?rata, 2009, and, for the Vedic period,? St. W. Jamison, Sacrificed Wife/Sacrificer's Wife, Oxford University Press, 1996.
Best regards, ?? Georges-Jean Pinault?

I would recommend e.g. Brill's Encyclopedia of Hinduism. The main article on this topic, Karen Pechilis' entry "Gender" (vol. 4, pp. 788-805), has an extensive and up-to-date bibliography. Plus this theme is discussed in several other entries in this Encyclopedia (they are easily to be found using an index).
