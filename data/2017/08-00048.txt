[INDOLOGY] sex and gender
Dear All. ? In addition to this reference to Brill's Encyclopedia of Hinduism, I may recommend specifically the two following books (which are most probably part of the bibliography of BEH): Kevin McGrath, Stri. Women in Epic Mah?bh?rata, 2009, and, for the Vedic period,? St. W. Jamison, Sacrificed Wife/Sacrificer's Wife, Oxford University Press, 1996.
