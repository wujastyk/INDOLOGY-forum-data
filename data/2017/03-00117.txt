=?utf-8?Q?[INDOLOGY]_Alpam=E1=B9=9Btyu?=
I wonder if list members might throw any light on the term alpam?tyu 
occurring in a 17th-century Sanskrit text (Y?dava's 
/T?jikayogasudh?nidhi/). I would have supposed it to be a scribal error 
for apam?tyu (in the sense of 'untimely death') were it not that the 
metre requires that the first syllable be long. I do not recall seeing 
the word in other Sanskrit texts, but a quick web search returns quite a 
number of hits in the vernaculars, including some from the 
R?mcaritm?nas. However, I am not sure from these whether to understand 
alpam?tyu as untimely death (= ak?lam?tyu), as a nearly but not quite 
fatal accident, either, or as something else entirely.
