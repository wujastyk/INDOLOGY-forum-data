[INDOLOGY] Concerning sandhi of vowels before (t)ti in Middle Indic
Dear Prof. Tieken,
Thank you very much for the informative and suggestive message.
According to my data, except for Pali literature and A?okan Minor Rock
inscriptions in question and two occurrences in unpublished fragments in
the Sch?yen Collection, the form -*? ti *occurs only in the
Mah?s??ghika-Lokottarav?dins' Mah?vastu, Bhik?u??vinaya and
Pr?timok?as?tra. The Mah?s??ghika school was predominant in Kali?ga.
With best wishes,
