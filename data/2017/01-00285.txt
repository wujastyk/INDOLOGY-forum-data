Dear List,
I am involved in the preparation of the supplement to the *Official List of
Polish Geographical Names of the World *- already published in 2005, by the
Head Office of Geodesy and Cartography (G??wny Urz?d Geodezji i
Kartografii), Warsaw, Poland -  and accessible at:

82%C3%B3wny_Urz%C4%85d_Geodezji_i_Kartografii_Warszawa_2005
The supplement  - planned to be published as the *Official List of Polish
Names of Historical Monuments and Buildings of the World *- is  to
include formal names of selected important South Asian historical
buildings/monuments; a provisional, not yet completed list, is accessible
at:

Usually, I do not have problems in locating the formal, official names of
geographical objects in India.
The *Bas?lica do Bom Jesus*, however,  eludes me. What I come across is *Borea
Jezuchi Bajilika, *as at:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilica_of_Bom_Jesus
Since the presumably Konkani name is already a transliteration, it cannot
 serve as the basis for precise transliteration and the Polish
transcription.
What I need are VERY FORMAL names of the Basilica - both in *Hindi* and
*Konkani *- such as those formally used and published in the Indian
Catholic Church sources.
If you would give me the names as they are written in Devanagari, I could
easily transliterate them - using myself the ISO 15919 rules of
Romanization.
Thank you in advance for your kind help,
