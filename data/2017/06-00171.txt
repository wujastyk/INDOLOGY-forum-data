[INDOLOGY] Warder Sanskrit Reader
Dear Ajay,
I'm sure I speak for everyone if I say: thank you, that is extremely kind! I think there already is a scan of Vol. 1, but if you could scan vols. 2 and 3, David can then see which volumes he has, and if there indeed are four volumes, maybe we will soon have a complete set of pdfs. How exciting!
All best, and thank you again,
     Antonia
