Dear friends,

I am trying to locate a copy of Esther Solomon, Avidya--A Problem of Truth and Reality, Gujarat University
thesis Publication Series, 1969. It doesn't seem to be available on archive.org.

(BTW - one of the funny difficulties in searching for Esther Solomon's work is that, because both of her
names are biblical, one turns up literally hundreds of hits for various Bible editions.)

If anyone might have a pdf, not of the Bible, but of Avidya, I'd be profoundly grateful.

thanks in advance,
Matthew
