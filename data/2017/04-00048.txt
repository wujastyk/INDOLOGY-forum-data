[INDOLOGY] question about mixed oral/manuscript transmission
His question: For comparison with the Sejarah Melayu, is there in the
Indian tradition (Vedic or epic, for example) texts transmitted on the one
hand in a written form (copies of manuscript in manuscript), on the other
hand Without written support (a scribe not writing a text that he knows by
heart)? I think that this has happened for the SM: some variants (eg the
displacement of episodes) can only be explained by a stage of memory. Do
you have the reference of an article on the subject, or do you have a book
that talks about it?
