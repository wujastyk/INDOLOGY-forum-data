I managed to find the Biardeau article, along with one by Anantlal Thakur and another by van Buitenen in the same issue:

1. Anantlal Thakur, "Studies on Vacaspati Misra (1)", Mitra-v??? 17/V?caspati vi?e???ka (1960), pp. 132?136.

2. Madeleine Biardeau, "V?caspati Mi?ra a Syncretist?", Mitra-v??? 17/V?caspati vi?e???ka (1960), pp. 137?142.

3. J. A. B. Van Buitenen, "Vacaspati's Critique of the Bhedabheda Doctrine of Bhaskar", Mitra-v??? 17/V?caspati vi?e???ka (1960), pp. 143?151.

I've put the PDF of these papers here:

  *   https://archive.org/details/MitraVani1960

The issue had many other interesting articles: see the table of contents.

Best,
Dominik
