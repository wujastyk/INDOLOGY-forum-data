Abstract
This article forms a preliminary report on the work by an international
group of scholars on Garga, an important early authority on astral science
(jyoti?a). Reviewing past research on the texts associated with this
figure, we focus especially on the earliest text, the G?rg?yajyoti?a (ca.
first century CE?), a compendium of material on astral and terrestrial
omens, ritual, horoscopy, and astronomy, that prefigures Var?hamihira's
well-known B?hatsa?hit?. The contributions include text-critical
observations based on select chapters, remarks on astral omens and their
relevance to the possible dating of the text, and a discussion of the texts
potential for the study of Hindu ritual. The article also begins to
disambiguate the broader Garga corpus by including a chapter summary of a
somewhat later Gargasa?hit?, containing mainly astronomical materials.
This article concludes HSSA issue 5.1.  Issue 5.2, which  is in press, is a
special themed issue,
*Transmutations: Rejuvenation, Longevity, andImmortality Practices in South
and Inner Asia, *guest-edited by Dagmar Wujastyk, Suzanne Newcombe, and
Christ?le Barois.
