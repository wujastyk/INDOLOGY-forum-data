[INDOLOGY] Waray collection of MSS in Pune?
Dear Friends,
     I am sorry to have referred to Dr. T.N. Dharmadhikari as "Late".  I
had a misperception based on reports of his ill health and frail condition
from my mother in Pune, who is in touch with the Dharmadhikari family.
Yesterday, I contacted my family in Pune to get the correct report, which
says that Dr. Dharmadhikari, though in very frail health, is still well and
alive.  I am sorry to have communicated a wrong impression.
