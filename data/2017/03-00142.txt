[INDOLOGY] Gerrit Jan Meulenbeld (28/5/1928 - 26/3/2017)
Dear Colleagues,
It is with great sadness that I inform you that Gerrit Jan Meulenbeld
passed away on March 26th at the age of 88. The cremation will take place
in Groningen this Friday.
Jan Meulenbeld was one of the great Dutch Indologists of his generation.
His monumental 5-volume A History of Indian Medical Literature (1999-2002)
stands as lasting testimony of his profound work on the history of
?yurveda.
