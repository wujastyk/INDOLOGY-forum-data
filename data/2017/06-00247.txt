** Clarification: Special Panel Proposals
------------------------------------------------------------
17th World Sanskrit Conference
Vancouver, Canada ? July 9-13, 2018

Dear Colleagues,

In fielding a number of related queries regarding the upcoming July 1 deadline for Special Panel proposals for WSC2018, we thought it appropriate to announce the following clarifications:

1. Panel proposals should consist of (a) a panel abstract, submitted by the panel organizer, as well as (b) individual paper abstracts for each presenter within the panel. This is to ensure that all papers presented at WSC2018 undergo the same review process.
2. The deadline for the panel abstract is July 1, 2017, at which point proposals will be distributed to our Academic Advisory Board for adjudication. However, we will accept the individual paper abstracts from prospective panelists until the general deadline of October 1, 2017.
3. If a panel proposal is declined, for whatever reason, the individual papers can still be considered for inclusion into WSC2018.
4. Should prospective panel organizers need additional time to organize their panels, they are advised to submit a draft panel proposal in the Submission Portal (https://wsc.ubcsanskrit.ca/ocs/wsc/2018/schedConf/cfp) before the deadline, and then kindly contact the WSC2018 Secretariat (wsc2018 at ubcsanskrit.ca) requesting additional time.

We hope that these points adequately address your questions about the upcoming deadline, and look forward to receiving your panel proposals through the WSC2018 Submission Portal (https://wsc.ubcsanskrit.ca/ocs/wsc/2018/schedConf/cfp) . As always, for up-to-date information, please consult the main conference website, wsc.ubcsanskrit.ca, and do not hesitate to  contact the WSC2018 Secretariat (wsc2018 at ubcsanskrit.ca) for further assistance.
