David Gordon White?s The Yoga Sutra of Patanjali: A Biography does a good job of collating the hagiographical details about Patanjali from a variety of sources.

Dear Colleagues,

In the preface to his interpretation of the Yoga-sutra (1889), the theosophist W.Q. Judge writes,

"About Patanjali's life very little, if anything, can be said. In the Rudra Jamala, the Vrihannandikes'wara and the Padma-Purana are some meager statements, more or less legendary, relating to his birth. Ilavrita-Varsha is said to have been his birthplace, his mother being Sati the wife of Angiras. The tradition runs that upon his birth he made known things past, present and future, showing the intellect and penetration of a sage while yet an infant. He is said to have married one Lolupa, whom he found in the hollow of a tree on the north of Sumeru, and thereafter to have lived to a great age. On one occasion, being insulted by the inhabitants of Bhotabhandra while he was engaged in religious austerities, he reduced them to ashes by fire from his mouth."

Has anyone located these or other similar stories of Patanjali?

Sincerely,
M?ns Broo
