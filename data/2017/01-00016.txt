i believe that the standard example of the barren woman's son - bandhyaputra - counts as atyant?bhava.

and, yes, happy new year to all!

To ALL,

A very very happy new year to All.


In the Vaishisheka parlance, Abhava ( i.e.negation) has been classified as- Prag-Abhav,
Dhangsh-Abhava and Attyanta-Abhava.

Can anybody suggest an example of Attyanta Abhava.?
