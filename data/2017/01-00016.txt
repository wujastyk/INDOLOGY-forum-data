[INDOLOGY] Attantya Abhava
i believe that the standard example of the barren woman's son - bandhyaputra - counts as atyant?bhava.
and, yes, happy new year to all!

[INDOLOGY] Attantya Abhava
To ALL,
A very very happy new year to All.
In the Vaishisheka parlance, Abhava ( i.e.negation) has been classified as- Prag-Abhav,
Dhangsh-Abhava and Attyanta-Abhava.
Can anybody suggest an example of Attyanta Abhava.?
