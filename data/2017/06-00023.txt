1. Points in such books are to be divided into two categories: observations
and explanations.

2. Explanations can be again divided into two kinds: 1. substantiated from
previous sources 2. Author's own conjectures, guesswork  etc.

3. These observations seem to be focused on /limited to social
relationships among Brahmins of different parts of India.

3. "Gurjaras are included among Dr?vi?as" - observation; one would ask for
corraboration from other sources since this is not 'established' /well
known/popular.

4.  other Dr?vi?as do not have any educational, ritual or marriage
relations with them- observation; gujarati (garjara = gujarati? or western
Indian?)-south Indian social relationships were not very intense, probably.

5. Intrigue of the author making him for look for explanations: 'why no
social relationships of south Indians with Gurjaras though they are
co-draaviDas?'

6. Gaurjaras are similar to gauDdes'a Brahmins or Kerala Brahmins in having
'an?c?ra'-observation used as explanation for the above observation' . '
an?c?ra' is not immoral but violative of (Brahmin) religious code. .'an?c?ra is
perception.

7. ?c?rya??pa  is the explanation probably invented by those sharing the
perception of 'an?c?ra.'

8. Fish-eating among Bengali Brahmins,  marital relationships of Kerala
Brahmins as part of the matrilinear system of certain non-Brahmin
communities could be the perceived  'an?c?ra.'
