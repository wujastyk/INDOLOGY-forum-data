[INDOLOGY] Article needed
Dear list members,
Would it be possible for someone to send me pages 20-21 of the article
Mandala, Yantra and Cakra: Sjome Observations by Gudrun Buhnemann in
Mandalas and Yantras in the Hindu Traditions by Gudrun Buhnemann et al.
If its not a violation of copyright the whole article pages 13 thru 57
would be useful.
Many thanks,
Harry Spier
