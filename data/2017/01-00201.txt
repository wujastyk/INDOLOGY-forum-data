Dear friends and colleagues,

I am glad to announce that the latest issue of the *Buddhist Studies Review
(33.1?2) *has been published online (
https://journals.equinoxpub.com/index.php/BSR/issue/current). The printed
issue will follow soon.
The core of the issue is constituted by a collection of articles on the
topic of ?Reuse and Intertextuality in the Context of Buddhist Texts? and
edited by Elisa Freschi together with Cathy Cantwell and Jowita Kramer.
Please scroll down for the table of contents.

The present writer would be happy to receive any feedback on the project of
dealing with reuse and intertextuality within the specific subfield of
Buddhist texts from the members of the list, either here or on Academia.edu
(
