[INDOLOGY] identification of a quotation
Dear all
I'd be grateful for any assistance in identifying the source of this 
quotation. This ?loka is quoted in a Tamil inscription (South Indian 
Inscriptions, Vol.I, N? 43, p.70) dated 1566-67 A.D., in Grantha script. 
I have transliterated the verse below:
?d?nap?lanayormadhye d?n?cchreyonup?lanam
d?n?t svargamav?pnoti p?lan?dacyutam padam?
This is translated by Hultzsch as:
?Of a gift and protection, protection is more meritorious than a gift; 
by a gift (one) obtains (only) heaven, by protection the eternal abode?.
Thank you in advance.
Sincerely,
*
