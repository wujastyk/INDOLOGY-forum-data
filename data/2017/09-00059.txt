K?lid?sa's mention of an Uragapura (or, in the reading known to Vallabhadeva, N?gapura) seems to have given rise to several theories.

Dak?i??varta?s location of the place on a river K?yaku?? is, as we have seen, echoed in the commentary Mallin?tha, but also in those of the Keralan commentators Aru?agirin?tha and N?r?ya?apa??ita.  Unsurprisingly, the late medieval commentators from further North seem not to provide information about the identity of the place or the river that it lies on.

Nandargikar in his notes to his 4th edition is categoric that the town must be Nagapattinam, which he asserts without any supporting argument (1971:123): 

?Hem?dri interpretes (sic) this by ?n?gapurasya n?tha?.? But he is evidently wrong, the town alluded to here is n?gapa??ana or n?gapa??a?a (Negapattam) in the R?jamahendri district of the Madras Presidency.?

(I suppose that this might mean that Nandargikar supposed that Hem?dri erroneously took the town to be the one that is now most famous under the name Nagpur.)

Then there is the possibility that Uragapura refers to Madurai (as in the post referred to by Emmanuel Francis: http://list.indology.info/pipermail/indology_list.indology.info/1999-March/016494.html).

Others again think it must be in a suburb of Trichy, at the Northern edge of the P???ya area (Ghurye, Caste and Race in India, p. 357):
?This is again the earliest and perhaps also the solitary reference to the famous early mediaeval and late ancient city or town of Uraiyur in Tiruchirapalli (Trichinopoly) district.?

Dhoy??s Pavanad?ta places the town on the bank of the T?mrapar??, which would preclude any identification with Nagapattinam, Madurai or Trichy: 

?r?kha???dre? parisaram atikramya gavy?tim?tra? 
gantavyas te kim api jagat?ma??ana? p???yade?a?/
tatra khy?ta? puram uragam ity ?khyay? t?mrap?r?y?? 
t?re mugdhakramukatarubhir baddharekhe bhajeth??// 8

But of course it is possible that Dhoy? knew little about Uragapura/N?gapura, having simply read about it in, for instance, K?lid?sa?s Raghuva??a in the context of the description of the P???yan king, and that he decided on that basis that it must be on the bank of the T?mrapar??.

Furthermore, it is perhaps not especially likely that K?lid?sa had been there either.  It could simply have been famous to him as the P???ya capital, either in his own time, or in some legendary timeless time that he himself knew of only from other literary references.

We should look for a place called Perumarut?r. Today, you will find many Marut?rs in Tamil Nadu. There is a Perumarut?r in Pudukkottai District (https://www.google.com/maps/@10.0792648,79.1085514,15.95z <https://www.google.com/maps/@10.0792648,79.1085514,15.95z>). But there are no inscriptional records supporting this location as a settlement of Brahmins of high achievement.

The I?aiy??putt?r copper plates (?va?am 18, p.10) mention a Perumarut?r, a village on the bank of the K?viri river where Vedic Brahmins lived. The objective of the grant was to give a Brahmin from this village a Brahmadeya village called I?aiy??putt?r in K?vilpa??i-Ca?kara?k?vil region of today. R. Nagaswamy has discussed this inscription in http://tamilartsacademy.com/articles/article54.xml <http://tamilartsacademy.com/articles/article54.xml>.

SII 12, no. 184 refers to a Brahmin from Perumarut?r living in Ulaka?antac??accaturvetima?kalam identified with Om?mpuliyur near Chidambaram. (The inscription also refers to a Tiruvala?cu?i U?aiy?r Iccippe??arayar of A?icupakkam. Interestingly Tiruvala?cu?i U?aiy?r is the Tamil equivalent of Dak?i??vartan?tha (except for the prefix Tiru-) and he is supposedly from A?icup?kkam.) Karantai Plates mention a

Karandai Plates of 1021 mention a Brahmin from the same village receiving a share of the grant. Karandai Plates also mention another Brahmin from Perumarut?r but living in a different village. SII 26, no. 729 of 1219-20 CE in Tirune?u?ka?am in Tiruchi district mentions a Ma??aiy??v?? Vetan?yakapa??an (Vedan?yakabha??a) of K??yapa gotra from Perumarut?r. Inscription SII 26, no. 140 of 1411 CE in Komaralingam in Coimbatore district mentions a Brahmin from Perumarut?r who acted as a representative of the Vijayanagara king.

I do not know if this was the Perumarut?r (contrasting with the Little Marut?r) mentioned in the inscriptions.

>> 
>> The place Tiruvala?cu?i [Thiruvalanjuli, also near Kumbakonam] given by Ajay K. Rao 2014 (your reference) was suggested by T. Ga?apati ??str? in his preface to the 1919 Trivandrum Sanskrit Series (no. 64) edition of the Meghasa?de?a with Dak?i??vartan?tha's Prad?pa (following the name of ?iva called Dak?i??vartan?tha in the sanctuary there, see: http://www.archive.org/details/MeghadutaWithTheCommentaryOfDaksinavartanatha <http://www.archive.org/details/MeghadutaWithTheCommentaryOfDaksinavartanatha> ). 
>> Unithiri 1976 (see below) suggests another Tiruvala?cu?i? in Kerala (Thrissur District), with the idea that D would be the Sanskritised form of a Malayalam place-name [Tiru +] "vala?cuzhi (dak?i?a = valam, 'right' + ?varta = cuzhi, 'whirlpool')". (Unni 1987, pp. 34-38, in discussing these suggestions even adds a third, Keralan also, Tiruvala?cu?i place, but he does not accept the Keralan ones and keeps the idea of the name Dak?i??vartan?tha as referring to the peculiar name of ?iva in the Tamil tradition linked to Tiruvala?cu?i near Kumbakonam). As we have seen, D gives the Sanskrit name of his place of origin (which could correspond to Tiruvi?aimarutt?r" [Thiruvidaimaruthur] near Kumbakonam, and thus close to the shrine of his name-deity according to N. P. Unni), for which you make now another suggestion of interpretation (Tiruppu?aimarut?r [Thiruppudaimaruthur], Ambasamudram taluk in Thirunelveli Distr. - http://tnmurals.org/Tiruppudaimaruduur.html <http://tnmurals.org/Tiruppudaimaruduur.html> : mural paintings in the temple).
>> 
>> As for the relative dating, according to T. Ga?apati ??str? the date of D must be between the 12th c. (since D quotes the lexicon of Ke?avasv?min [ed. TSS 23, 29, 31, 1913] dated by Ga?apati ??str? to the 12th c. - but this lexicon belongs probably rather to the 2nd part of the 13th c. according to Madhukar M. Patkar, History of Sanskrit Lexicography, 1981, p. 97) and Aru?agirin?tha's time  (contemporary of  Mallin?tha, early 15th century).
>> Examining the peculiar relationships between Dak?i??vartan?tha's Prad?pa and P?r?asarasvat?'s Vidyullat?, S.K. De (intr. to his critical ed. of the poem, 1957, p. xxxi fn. 92 ; cf. also 1957 below, pp. 51-52) presumes that D is prior to P. This is also the opinion of Unni with a few more arguments (1987, pp. 52-53, cf. 2016 below). But Unithiri, who has made a closer comparison between the two (1976: "It is to be noticed that in almost all cases [when D differs from P in readings] D[a]k[?i??vartan?tha] notes the variant readings which are those  of P[?r?a]s[arasvat?] and in most cases those of P[a]r[ame?va] also, indicating thereby that Dk corrects the traditionally accepted readings for his own reasons" ? about 20 such occurrences) has suggested the reverse (1975, p. viii; cf. also Iyer 1965, stressing on the differences between the Kerala textual tradition of P?r?asarasvat?/Parame?vara, on the one hand, and the one of Dak?i??vartan?tha/Mallin?tha on the other).
>> 
>> Having myself several reasons to place P in the first part of the 14th c. (he must be close to Payy?r Bha??a Parame?vara 'I', fl. c. 1330, whose Sumanorama?? criticizes the Vidyullat? in a manner letting think that the two authors were very near in time and place), it would mean that D would belong either to to middle/second part of the 14th c. (close to both Mallin?tha and Aru?agirin?tha ? there is some connexion between them by their respective choices of names: A and M inspired by/having studied with D?) if he comes after, or to 2nd part of the 13th c. if he come before. I am at the moment of my examination rather inclined to place D after P.

If one considers the possibility that this name is a translation of some Tamil name, one has to allow for ?losses in translation?. According to Monier Williams, k?ya also means "assemblage , collection , multitude SaddhP.? This seems to be a synonym of sa?gha (perhaps referring to the legendary Tamil assembly in Madurai) or a translation of ?Ta. K??al?, another name of the city of Madurai.

K?lkhoi emporion, Ptolemy Geogr. 7, 1, 10). But the Tamil word k?yal ('backwater, mouth of a stream") is far from the meaning of "Curve of the body" (ku?? is found in several words for/names of "curving" rivers). The T?mrapar??  herself is described by K?lid?sa in 4.50 (53  crit. ed. Goodall & Isaacson).

P. Unni (Highways and Byways in Sanskrit Literature, Delhi: New Bharatiya Book Corporation, 2012, p. 159, who relies on a KUML transcript-manuscript). It is in this case (like in other) the source of  Aru?agirin?tha (contemporary of  Mallin?tha, early 15th century - the latter who also sometimes uses Dak?i??vartan?tha has possibly misread his source here or, as you guess, his text has been later corrupted), himself followed by  N?r?ya?a Pa??ita.
