[INDOLOGY] Annals of Oriental Research of Madras
Dear All,
I was wondering whether someone might have a PDF of the first volume of the
Annals of Oriental Research of the University of Madras, 1936-37 (not to be
confused with the Journal of Oriental Research Madras). I have located
several other volumes online but not the first.
All the Best,
Victor
