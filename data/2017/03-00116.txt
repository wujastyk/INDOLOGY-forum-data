[INDOLOGY] (Another) pdf request - Masked Ritual
Dear Prof. Wujastyk,
You are perfectly right. The appeal of readily having a pdf of a book you
need is sometimes irresistible, especially for a PhD student whose life can
be tough (at least in Italy).
Sorry for that.
With my best regards,
Chiara Policardi
