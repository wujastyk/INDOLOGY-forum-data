[INDOLOGY] Lucid dreaming in Sanskrit?
This is somewhat off the topic, but the discussion of dreams reminded me of a curious reference to dreaming in the Akan????u (poem 303 by Auvaiy?r):
I was afraid others might know what happened between us
and, just as a demon never tells his dreams,
I hid my secret, yet now that he has gone,
my desire, so subtle and filled with every sort of goodness,
has turned into gossip that, as it rises, is like the rushing waterfall	5
spreading from the summit of great Kolli mountain
with its demon-haunted spaces and clouds that rain willingly,
ruled by Po?aiya? whose ornaments are of fresh gold, whose army is valiant,
whose spear brings victory.
Here is my note on the second line:
2. ?Just as a demon never tells his dreams? is p?ey ka??a ka?avil. This is K?s interpretation, while K2 takes its other possible meaning: ?like a dream (you have) of a demon.? He remarks that people do not tell others about their nightmares. If K2 is correct, one would expect the k of ka??a to be doubled, which it is not.
I am wondering whether anyone on the list has come across anything in Sanskrit that would throw light on this. George Hart
