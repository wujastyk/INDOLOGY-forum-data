[INDOLOGY] request for scan
Dear list members,
An unfortunate accident in my copy of the Madras University Sanskrit Series No. 24 edition of B?hat? of Prabh?kara Mi?ra,, volume 3, containing adhy?ya 1 p?das 2,3,4 and adhy?ya 2 complete makes part of pages 409 and 410 unreadable. I?m hoping a list member can provide a scan of these pages (or a scan of the entire volume).
Thank you.
