[INDOLOGY] Once again on the origin of zero: the date of the Bakhshali manuscript (or manuscripts?)
I fully concur with what Dr Acri has to say in this matter. Moreover, the
initial statement of the interviewed mathematician ?The most exciting thing
is that we?ve identified a zero? is presumptuous, as the ?identification?
claimed here is actually decade-long common Indological knowledge easily
traceable in the relevant literature on the subject. I wonder why no
Indologist with a profound disciplinary knowledge was asked to give
qualified statements.
A reproduction together with a transliteration of this famous manuscript
was brought to the public in 1995:
Takao Hayashi, The Bakshali Manuscript. Groningen 1995.
The individual *ak?ara*s of the Baksh?li MS can be consulted in their
extracted forms and, in the possible attempt of a fresh dating, compared to
their paleographic environment most conveniently by using the tools of

Ego ex animi mei sententia spondeo ac polliceor
studia humanitatis impigro labore culturum et provecturum
non sordidi lucri causa nec ad vanam captandam gloriam,
sed quo magis veritas propagetur et lux eius, qua salus
humani generis continetur, clarius effulgeat.
