[INDOLOGY] Buddhist Text
 Dr.Cahill,
  Thank you,once again, for the article by Jason Brown, entitled-'Microgenesis and Buddhsim'. 
It is an illuminating article focussing on hidden areas.However, I would ,with all humbleness, 
like to mention that there exists an apparent contradiction between momentariness ( 
KshanikaVada)and law of Dependent Origination( Patticchya Samutpada),which has been  
explicitly mentioned and denounced  in Badarayan's BrahmaSutra' where he states-???? ??????????? 
?????? ???????????? ??????? .
       Logically viewing, an entity which is  Kshanika i.e created and destructed instantly 
cannot lead to another entity ( which is the Law of dependent origination)
                                                      ALAKENDU DAS
