Kane lists this work in his HD? (I/1, p. 990), but apparently does not discuss it anywhere in his book (I have checked indexes to all volumes). This is confirmed by Derret:
1/ "Most an?c?ra works are late. Kane mentions without particulars only the An?c?ra-nir?aya. K iii, 848, 856 f., discusses the earliest treatment of anomalous customs."
(Essays in Classical and Modern Hindu Law, vol. 2, Leiden: Brill, 1977, p. 62, n. 190)
2/ "On an?c?ra see ibid. [= Religion, Law and the State in India] 103, 193. Kane, HD I, 508 (An?c?ra-nir?aya, no particulars)."
(Dharma??stra and Juridical Literature, HIL 5.1, Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, p. 22, n. 114).
Interesting is another Derret's note:
"The Sanskrit for 'repugnant custom' is an?c?ra.  Works devoted to this topic (see Bh?rat?ya Vidy?, 6 (1945), pp. 27 ff.)  are all late."
(Religion, Law and the State in India, Delhi, Oxord University Press, 1999, p. 158, n. 1.)
The paper from BhV quoted by Derret is:
P. K. Gode, "Some Provincial Social Customs and Manners as dur?c?ras by Varadar?ja (a pupil of Bha??oji D?k?ita) ? (c. A.D. 1600?1660)"
Gode quotes here an interesting dialog from the G?rv??apadama?jar? that lists 17 dur?c?ras from different parts of India.
