[INDOLOGY] The symbolism of lion and tiger
Dear Paolo,
One of the best studies on animals in Indian culture is Alexandra van der
Geer's *Animals in Stone: Indian Mammals Sculptured Through Time,
Brill. *Leiden
& Boston; 2008. See Chapters 33, 34, 35 ((Lion, Leopard,& Tiger). She
provides an excellent brief synopsis and an almost overwhelming
bibliography.
