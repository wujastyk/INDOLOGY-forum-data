Hello all,

This is from a colleague who is not on the list. Please direct inquiries 
to: John Shook, PhD, Philosophy, University at Buffalo jrshook at buffalo.edu

John Shook, in charge of this, emphasized to me that the authors the 
volume seeks to include need not be professional philosophers.

Best wishes,

The new Bloomsbury Encyclopedia of Philosophers is seeking scholars to

the inclusion of 150 philosophical thinkers who lived and worked in the 
India subcontinent between 1600 and 2000.

We hope to complete this list by March 2018. During 2018, we will be 
recruiting contributors to write entries about these 150 thinkers, and 
these entries will be collected
during 2019. Contributors are paid 40 pounds. To communicate your 
suggestions of thinkers to include, contact: John Shook, PhD,
