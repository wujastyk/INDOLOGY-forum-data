[INDOLOGY] Call for Contributions: Bloomsbury Encyclopedia of Philosophers, India 1600 to 2000 (apologies for cross posting)
Hello all,
This is from a colleague who is not on the list. Please direct inquiries 
to: John Shook, PhD, Philosophy, University at Buffalo jrshook at buffalo.edu
John Shook, in charge of this, emphasized to me that the authors the 
volume seeks to include need not be professional philosophers.
Best wishes,
