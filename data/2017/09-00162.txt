[INDOLOGY] Esther A. Solomon
Dear friends,
As I read through Esther Solomon's dissertation, Avidy??A Problem of Truth and Reality,
which was kindly made available to me in pdf by members of this list, I have wanted to learn
more of Solomon herself, but have not so far found reference to a biography or even a
necrology. What I have been able to learn, in essence, is that she was a member of the small
Ahmedabadi Jewish community, for which she is a source of pride owing to her accomplishments
as a Sanskrit scholar. But, besides elements of her bibliography, that's about all I've been able
to come up with.
Might any of you know of a source that provides a sketch of her life and career? She certainly merits
a few paragraphs in the annals of twentieth-century Indology.
thanks in advance,
Matthew
