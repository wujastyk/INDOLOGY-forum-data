Dear Dominik,

As the US federal budget is a congressional matter, it is essential for US citizens to make
their concerns known to their representatives, but I rather doubt that there is much
that non-US citizens can do here. If one has knowledge of individual US congressional
representatives who are particularly interested in relevant issues (e.g. US-India relations)
it may be worthwhile for concerned persons to write to them; it wouldn't hurt in any case.

best,
Matthew
