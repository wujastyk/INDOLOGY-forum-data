>From the server side, one potential solution is to login to your list options page (http://listoptions.indology.info) and try changing the encoding of the digests from MIME to Plain Text.

Incidentally, as a reminder to us all, the list options page is where one would go to start/stop receiving Digests, change one?s email or password, temporarily suspend email delivery, and perform an assortment of other features of the list.
