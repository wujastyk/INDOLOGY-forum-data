Subject: [INDOLOGY] detailed maps of undivided Andhra Pradesh
Message-ID: <DB6PR0801MB17679BA99C7CA2C9CFF0E2C1A5770@DB6PR0801MB1767.eurprd08.prod.outlook.com>

Dear colleagues,


In order to create a map op archaeological of sites and epigraphical findspots of early historical material from undivided Andhra Pradesh, and notably for the inscriptions of Nagarjunakonda, I am looking for detailed maps of the region, from before the submersion of the Nagarjunakonda site due to construction of the Nagarjuna Sagar dam.


Does anyone have detailed (1:25,000) maps for the Andhra region, or does anyone know how to obtain them? Ideally, of course, in digital form.


Thank you.


Arlo Griffiths
