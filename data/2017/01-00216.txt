[INDOLOGY] detailed maps of undivided Andhra Pradesh
Dear colleagues,
In order to create a map op archaeological of sites and epigraphical findspots of early historical material from undivided Andhra Pradesh, and notably for the inscriptions of Nagarjunakonda, I am looking for detailed maps of the region, from before the submersion of the Nagarjunakonda site due to construction of the Nagarjuna Sagar dam.
Does anyone have detailed (1:25,000) maps for the Andhra region, or does anyone know how to obtain them? Ideally, of course, in digital form.
Thank you.
