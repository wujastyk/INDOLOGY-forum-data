Dear all,
Would anyone happen to have a PDF copy of the Vasi??ha-siddh?nta (an astronomical treatise attributed to the sage Vasi??ha)?
Vindhye?var? Pras?da ?arman Dvived? (editor), Vasi??hasiddh?nta. Vidy?vil?sa Presa, Ban?rasa, 1907.
Another edition would work, too, though I don?t think one exists.
(Note that there?s an edition, by the same editor, of the V?ddha-vasi??ha-siddh?nta available at archive.org?see: https://archive.org/details/JyotishSiddhantSangraha?but that?s a different text than the one I?m after.)
With all best wishes,
Toke
