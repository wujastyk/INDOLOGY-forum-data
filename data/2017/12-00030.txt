Dear Friends and Colleagues,
I was wondering if any kind soul might be able to furnish me with a PDF of
the following:
A Catalogue of the To?hoku University Collection of Tibetan Works on
Buddhism
Bibliographic details:
To?hoku Daigaku, and Ensho? Kanakura. 1953. A Catalogue of the To?hoku
University Collection of Tibetan works on Buddhism. Sendai: Seminary of
Indology, To?hoku University.
My thanks in advance,
Charles
