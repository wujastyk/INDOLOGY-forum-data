Subject: [INDOLOGY] request for pdf of journal article
Message-ID: <9AAF5CE9-C524-4AFD-82DE-1A05792171E1@gmail.com>

I?m looking for a pdf of an article by Jan Sz. Otrebski in Lingua Posnaniensis 5. Manfred Mayrhofer mentions in Kurzgefasstes Etymologisches W?rterbuch des Altindischen, that Otrebski argued on page 174 against connection with Lithuanian spangus and Serbo-Croatian bangav. Unfortunately, I cannot trace the name of the article. The publication date was probably in the 1950s.

Thank you all in advance.

Elliot
