[INDOLOGY] PDF request
Dear List Members,
I have been looking in vain for a scan of volume III of
*A Descriptive Catalogue of the Sanskrit Manuscripts in H. H. the
Maharaja's Palace Library, Trivandrum*, ed. K. S?mba?ivas?str?, Trivandrum:
1937.
I would be most grateful for any help in case anybody happens to have a PDF
of it or knows where it may be downloaded (I could only find volumes I, II
and VIII on archive.org).
With all best wishes,
Isabelle Rati?
