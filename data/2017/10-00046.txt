Message-ID: <CAAiVBEWtD-jO+z8-Tf3xUrDXW4Y0WdWi991RZN02RGwVxPR-Tg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Friends, This might be a long shot, but interlibrary loan can't even
get this form me. Would anyone have a soft copy of:

Carlo Formichi's I primi principi della politica secondo Kamandaki /
Politeia: Collezione di studi politici e sociali.
