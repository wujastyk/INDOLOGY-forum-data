[INDOLOGY] Sanskrit Readers: overview
Dear Dr. Ruppel,
Below are listed 17 more Sanskrit readers, which I believe have not
been mentioned yet, that we have here in the library of the Oxford
Centre for Hindu Studies. Nearly all of these were readers for BA
degrees in various institutions in Bombay and Pune. All of these come
from the library of the late Prof. J.A.F. Roodbergen.
Best wishes,
Rembert
