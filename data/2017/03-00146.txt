[INDOLOGY] Gerrit Jan Meulenbeld (28/5/1928 - 26/3/2017)
Dear colleagues,
I am very sad to hear the news of the demise of Prof. Meulenbeld.
I was first inspired by his book on M?dhavanid?na and then
by the monumental book A History of Indian Medical Literature.
Although he passed away, his achievements will be alive forever.
