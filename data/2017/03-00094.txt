Subject: [INDOLOGY] Source of astrological quotation
Message-ID: <f97c8d18-549c-2ae5-077e-1fd4026bc74a@gmail.com>

I am looking for the source of an astrological stanza in sv?gat? metre, 
relating to the prediction of death and containing (probably beginning 
with) the line /kr?rakhecarada??samaye ca/. It is quoted by Balahadra 
simply as 'j?takokta', suggesting that it derives from a major or 
well-known work, but I have been unable to locate it in the sources I 
have consulted so far (the B?hatsa?hit?, B?hajj?taka, Laghuj?taka, 
J?takakarmapaddhati/?r?patipaddhati and S?r?val?). If anyone should 
recognize it, or have any ideas as to likely sources, I'd be glad to know.
