[INDOLOGY] Patanjali and Vishnu
No, Bhoja composed the yogena cittasya padena v?c?m verse.  They do not
exist in earlier Sanskrit literature.
There's a different couplet in Bhartrhari's Vakyapadiya that it somewhat
suggestive of a similar idea, but Patanjali isn't mentioned and it's not
clear to whom Bhartrhari is referring.
Apologies that my remarks are laconic; I'm in a confererence.
Best,
Dominik
