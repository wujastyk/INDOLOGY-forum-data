[INDOLOGY] Tantraratna Parthasarathi Misra PDF vol 2 & 3
Dear  Scholars
I am unable to trace the famous work Tantraratna which is a commentary on
Tuptika. Only 1st volume is available on DLI ed by Ganganath Jha. Not
available the rest even in shops or library in which I have access. Any one
kindly share the PDF.
Thanks
