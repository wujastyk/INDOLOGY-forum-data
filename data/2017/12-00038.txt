[INDOLOGY] contacting Dipak Bhattacharya
Dear colleagues,
Prof. Bhattacharya used to be an active member of the list, but it has been a while since we last received a message from him, if memory serves me well.
I just tried to contact him using these addresses:
<bhrya at rediffmail.com>
<dbhattacharya2004 at yahoo.co.in>
My message was returned by both.
Does anyone have a working address for Prof. Bhattacharya, if he is not himself following the list any longer?
Best wishes,
Arlo Griffiths
