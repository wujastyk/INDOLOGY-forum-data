Dear Colleagues,

I know it's been a while for this discussion, but I did some digging this
morning and thought that others might be interested in Brill's profit
margins and how they brag about increased revenue from academic journals in
recent years. A few highlights:

Brill had a "sharp increase of profit" from 2015 to 2016 (here
<http://www.brill.com/sites/default/files/brill_press_release_egm.pdf>),
followed by another increase in 2017 (here

)
