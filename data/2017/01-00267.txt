Dear Dominik,

Many thanks for this list, it is very helpful!

I would add the following two terms:

yantra, printing press

a?kita, printed (or typeset?)

I'm not sure about the last one, actually printed should be mudrita, but since the term a?kita occurs both in the title page of the 1814 Calcutta (Khidirapura) edition of Bh?ravi?s Kir?t?rjun?ya with Mallin?tha?s commentary printed with movable types, as well as in the colophon of an 1861 lithography of the ??drakamal?kara, I believe it ought to mean printed.

I briefly discuss the term in my 2016 article on Sanskrit print, but leaving a question mark about the meaning. I would be grateful if any of you has a suggestion as to the meaning of this term.

Best wishes,

Camillo
