[INDOLOGY] Sanskrit idiom question
dv?ra? kurute should mean (?makes a door??>) ?provides an opening; cf. Ashok Aklujkar, 2005, Sanskrit: an Easy Introduction to an Enchanting Language, vol. 1, appendix 8, item/point 19 (probably on the basis of V.S. Apte?s _Student?s Guide to Sanskrit Composition): 
	>A number of idiomatic constructions are possible with the root k?.  In interpreting them, the original sense of k? ?make/fashion, do, cause? should be appropriately extended; thus, sa? j??? kurute ?He makes the designation ?> coins the name ?> gives the name?; citte karoti  ?He does in mind ?> brings about in mind ?> thinks about?; pada? karoti ?He makes a step ?> he takes a step ?> steps.?<
Like the imaginary movement phrases (pa?catva? gam, nidhana? gam, etc.), the k? phrases illustrated above are an open class. 
This should be da?amad??? dvir, with dvir/dvis going with dv?ra? kurute and meaning ?for a second time, once again, afresh?. I have come across other cases of dvi misread as di or ddhi.
