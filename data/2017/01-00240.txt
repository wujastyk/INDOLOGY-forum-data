Dear Colleagues,
     I have access to Ganganath Jha's translations of Kum?rila's
?lokav?rttika and Tantrav?rttika.  Kum?rila's ?up??k? comments on Jaimini's
M?m??s?s?tras beginning with the 4th Adhy?ya to the end, but I have not
seen Jha's translation of this commentary.  Was such a translation ever
published by Jha?  Any info would be useful to me.  Thanks.
