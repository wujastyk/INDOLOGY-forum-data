[INDOLOGY] My Sanskrit rendering of Goethe's poem on Shakuntala
Thanks, Antonia, for that reference.  During my undergraduate days in
Fergusson College in Pune, I was studying German along with Sanskrit.
There was a celebration of 50 years of German teaching in Pune, and we
performed the 4th act of ??kuntalam on stage in German.  I acted as
??r?garava and my Sanskrit teacher Pt. N. N. Bhide (who also knew German)
played the role of Ka?va.  It was sometime around this occasion that I
translated Goethe's poem into Sanskrit.
