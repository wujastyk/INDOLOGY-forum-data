[INDOLOGY] My Sanskrit rendering of Goethe's poem on Shakuntala
Dear Professor Deshpande,
another insignificant remark. Fruit in the poem belong to autumn, they are
of 'sp?teren Jahres', are of the year's 'decline'. Wouldn't *?aradi* fit
the text better than *gr??**me*?
With highest regards,
Artur Karp

PS. Could you please direct me to someone using Goan Konkani?
Thank you,
Artur K.
