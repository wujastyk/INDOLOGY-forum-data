 From 1st of June 2017, the department for Culture and History of India 
and Tibet at the Asia-Africa Institute of Hamburg University 
(https://www.aai.uni-hamburg.de/indtib/personen.html) has appointed a 
new professor for Tamilistics and manuscript studies.
Since March 2014, Tamil has been strongly represented in research at the 
Hamburg Centre for the Study of Manuscript Cultures 
(http://www.manuscript-cultures.uni-hamburg.de), thanks to the ERC 
Advanced Grant NETamil (Going from Hand to Hand: Networks of 
Intellectual Exchange in the Tamil Learned Traditions; 
http://netamil.org/), which allows an international team of twenty-seven 
scholars to digitise the remaining textual witnesses for several 
literary traditions, to edit them and to follow up on their transmission 
history. A group of four doctoral and postdoctoral scholars under PI Eva 
Wilden are affiliated to the CSMC and work in close collaboration with 
the Indian part of the team at the centre of the Ecole Fran?aise 
d?Extr?me-Orient (EFEO) in Puducherry. Since then Tamil is found among 
the optional languages in the indological curriculum in Hamburg.
