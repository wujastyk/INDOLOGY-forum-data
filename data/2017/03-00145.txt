Dear Peter,

Your news brought tears to my eyes, as Jan has been a mentor and good friend since we first met in Australia in 1977. His work is indispensable for any serious study of Ayurveda and Indian medical history.  He was a thorough scholar, but perhaps more important he was a great human being. I send my deepest condolences to his family and friends.

Ken

Dear Colleagues,

It is with great sadness that I inform you that Gerrit Jan Meulenbeld passed away on March 26th at the age of 88. The cremation will take place in Groningen this Friday.

Jan Meulenbeld was one of the great Dutch Indologists of his generation. His monumental 5-volume A History of Indian Medical Literature (1999-2002) stands as lasting testimony of his profound work on the history of ?yurveda.

A list of his publications may be found here: https://www.dutchstudies-satsea.nl/deelnemers/meulenbeld-gerrit-jan/
