Dear Christophe,

thanks, I did not think to have a look of other secondary publications.
Thus, I suppose the verse is right and it should appears somewhere also in
the DP ed. of P. Kumar.

On the other hand, I think Dehejia mis-cited *DP *(in fact it did not
appear in final bibliography) and probably she confused with
*Devibhagavatapurana* although there are two lists there, the first
composed of 108 places and the second (in the devigita section) composed of
71 or 72 (if you consider also Varanasi as the seat where all the goddess's
forms resides together). Very strange.

Best,
Paolo
