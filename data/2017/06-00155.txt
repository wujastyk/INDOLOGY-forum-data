[INDOLOGY] Warder Sanskrit Reader
Dear Antonia and James,
A number of years ago I tried to obtain Volume 2 of the Reader (the Notes
Volume) from UoT on Interlibrary loan and was denied. I emailed scholarly
lists and academics at UoT trying to try to obtain a copy and was given
multiple assurances that copies were available and would be willingly
provided - again without success. Eventually I contacted the UoT library
directly and offered to buy one of their 10 spare copies so I could scan it
and put it on Archive.ORG. For my trouble I received an astonishing email
from an academic administrator informing me that I was soliciting copyright
breach and that the appropriate thing to do would be to attend the UoT
library personally and use the material there. Living in Australia makes
this rather... difficult...
Long story short, I own a copy of Volume One and have seen photographs(!)
of Volume Two. I would be very happy to provide a high resolution pdf of
Volume One but would be eternally grateful if someone else could obtain
Volume Two. We could then put the material on Archive.ORG for the benefit
of all Sanskrit scholars!
Kind regards,
Antonio
