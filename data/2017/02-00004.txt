Dear Omar,
Besides Vettam Mani?s  *Pur??ic Encyclopaedia*, there is another pur??a
reference work: *The Purana Index*, by V. R. Ramachandra Dikshitar, 3
volumes, University of Madras, 1951-1955 (reprinted by Motilal Banarsidass
in 1995). It covers only five pur??as, which it regarded as the most
ancient: V?yu, Brahm???a, Matsya, Vi??u, and Bh?gavata. For the particular
Urva?? episode that you inquired about, under Urva??, it gives as source
Matsya-pur??a 24.12-33. It utilized the 1907 ?nand??rama edition of the
Matsya-pur??a.
The 1916 English translation of *The Matsya Puranam*, made by "A Taluqdar
of Oudh," published in 2 parts as volume 17 of The Sacred Books of the
Hindus series, does not state what Sanskrit edition it was made from.
However, the above-given reference to 24.12-33 is right for this episode in
it. My impression is that this is a rather loose translation of the Matsya-
pur??a. A new English translation of the *Matsya Mah**?**pur?**?a* by "A
Board of Scholars" was published by Parimal Publications in 2007.
We unfortunately do not yet have a critical edition of the Matsya-pur??a.
One was undertaken by V. Raghavan shortly after the inception of the
All-India Kashiraj Trust, and he published articles on it in their *P**ur?*
*?a* journal starting with vol. 1 in 1959. Although he published "A Sample
Edition of the Matsya Pur??a" in vol. 4, 1962, neither he nor others ever
completed this edition. Thus, we do not know if some Matsya-pur??a
manuscripts have variant readings for the characters in this Urva?? episode.
While Vettam Mani?s account has Agastya giving the curse, the ?nand??rama
edition of the Matsya-pur??a has Bharata giving the curse.
