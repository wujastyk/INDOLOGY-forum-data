> Dear Professors and Collegues,
>
>
> my name is Omar Abu Dbei and I am currently a PhD student under the
> supervision of Raffaele Torella in Rome.
> While consulting Vettam Mani?s  *Pur??ic Encyclopaedia*, I have found a
> reference, under the entry *Urva?? *(pp. 812-813), to a mythical episode
> that might be, under many respects, of the greatest interest for my
> research:
>
> *Once Agastya went to the durbar of Indra. On the occasion Indra asked
> Urva?? to dance. In the midst of the dance she saw Jayanta, the son of
> Indra, and became amorous and her steps went wrong. N?rada who was playing
> his famous lute called Mahat? could not play well. Agastya went angry and
> cursed Jayanta to become a bud. He cursed N?rada also. So his lute became
> the lute of the world. Urva?? was born on the earth under the name M?dhav?
> due to the curse*.
>
>
>
> Unfortunately, no Sanskrit source is recorded and, not being a specialist
> myself in the field of *Pur??a*s, I have been unable so far to find any
> possible one. Is there anybody who knows the exact source of this myth?
>
>
> Many thanks for your attention.
