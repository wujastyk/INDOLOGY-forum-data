[INDOLOGY] Wackernagel: Nominalsuffixe
Dear list members,
I?m wondering if anyone has a pdf copy of Wackernagel: Altindische Grammatik, II,2: Die Nominalsuffixe, and would be willing to share it?
The other volumes of his grammar seem to be available in the web, but II.2 is missing (copyright issues?).
Best, Oliver
