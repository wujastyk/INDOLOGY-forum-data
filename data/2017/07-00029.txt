Message-ID: <FC3B9F63834B4C2AB81232889C5C72A7@OliverHP>

Dear list members,

I?m wondering if anyone has a pdf copy of Wackernagel: Altindische Grammatik, II,2: Die Nominalsuffixe, and would be willing to share it?

The other volumes of his grammar seem to be available in the web, but II.2 is missing (copyright issues?).

Best, Oliver
