Thanks to all who responded to my query re: Vishvanath Temple.

I have another problem, a bit funny, perhaps.

Be, please, patient with me and help me with locating the source of the
famous mantra used during the marriage ceremony (panigrahana).

This I am, that art thou,
That indeed, art thou, this, yea, This I am.
I, the heaven, thou, the earth,
I am saman, thou are rik,
Let us marry, let us marry here.
Let us join together and beget our little ones,
Loving each other, desirous of moral splendour,
With genial minds and hearts,
Thus, yea, thus may we live,
Through a hundred autumns.

And - what is the source of the mantra repeated during the saptapadi?

Thanking you in advance

Artur Karp
