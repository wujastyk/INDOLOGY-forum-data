APOLOGIES RE: Posting: Library of Congress on Pakistan,              Bangladesh, and South Asian Islam
Dear Colleagues:
Please pardon this posting and disregard it.  I sent it out to someone
who was interested, with a warning that it was closed and will probably
not be reopened, and forgot about the various blind carbonings I had
made.
