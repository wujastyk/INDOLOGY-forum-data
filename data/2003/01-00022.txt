I would suggest:
W. Kirfel's Pur-a.na Pa?ncalak.sa.na;
and all the old editions in the Bibliotheca Indica series, the Trivandrum
Sanskrit series (only some of them have been reprinted by Nag or
Munshiram), the K-avya m-al-a series or without-series of the Nir.naya
S-agara Press in Bombay (also only a few reprinted in India) and the Bombay
Sanskrit series. The full availability of such important series is a
desideratum for individual Indologists as well as for "young" university
libraries (even the old university libraries could be interested to buy new
exemplars of them).
