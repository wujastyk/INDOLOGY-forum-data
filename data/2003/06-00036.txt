Tibetan text availablility
Gene Smith and TBRC are obviously involved in this project for some
other reason than to make their boat payments; the Kanjur from TBRC
is $195 for individuals. You decide.
(I assume, althoughthe web site does not say so, that the basis of
the Koyasan CD version is the copy of the Derge held at Koyasan. My
memory, although I may wrong about this, is that this is not the
first printing [parphu], but a subsequent printing which has slight
internal adjustments. It is also somewhere in my brain that this copy
may correspond completely, as the parphu does not, to the Tohoku
catalogue. This means, by the way, that there are slight variations
between the so-called Rumtek edition reproduced in the TBRC Derge
Kanjur and the Tohoku catalogue; in almost all cases, however, the
correspondences should be transparent.
