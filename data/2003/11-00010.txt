SV: Dandin
Hello Stefan,
Thanks for your answer. My inquiry is really on the part of a student who wants me to be her supervisor for her masters (von Simson has retired, so I am the closest you get to an old-fashioned Sanskritist in Oslo right now). She is interested in women studies and plans to have a look at prostitutes in Dandin. I don't know how relevant your thesis is to her project, but personally, I would be very interested. So I would very much like to receive your PDF. If it is useful for her, I'll pass it on.
Best regards,
Lars Martin
