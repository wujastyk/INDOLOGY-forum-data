The perl module `Sort::ArbBiLex -- make sort functions for arbitrary

I've written a short perl script to sort utf-8 Romanised Skt.,
`sort-utf8-rom-skt-proto' (my first, so be kind). The script calls
`Sort::ArbBiLex' and is based on a couple of examples in the man
pages.

I would welcome remarks, bug reports &c.
Best regards,
