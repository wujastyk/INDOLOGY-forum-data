Sanskrit word order sort program ?
I have an excel macro which will convert Sanskrit romanization (unicode)
into a number. Sorting by this number will produce correct dictionary order.
I don't have a solution for Tibetan yet.
This works for Excel XP on Windows, I'm not sure if it would work for any
other system.
Let me know if this would help.
