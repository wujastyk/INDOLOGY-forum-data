<<The best I can do is to think of them as the Adhimuktabodha Inst.
<<(despite the apparently Buddhist heritage of the word)

The Buddhist sense of adhimukta would hardly be possible
as a sort of synonym of mukta, since the cognates of adhi-muc
refer to a being inclined upon, devoted to, an adherence to
or a being resolved upon -- thus to a rather unliberated state.

At least in the Kashmirian Trika system of philosophical reflection
even the inclination toward liberation seems to be something
the liberated understanding (muktabodha) is liberated from.

To quote from Abhinavagupta's AnuttarASTikA:

saMsAro 'sti na tattvatas tanubhRtAM bandhasya vArtaiva kA
bandho yasya na jAtu tasya vitathA muktasya muktikriyA |
mithyAmohakRd eSa rajjubhujagacchAyApizAcabhramo
mA kiMcit tyaja mA gRhANa vihara svastho yathAvasthitaH ||


No rebirths-redeaths cycle is, truly speaking, found.
What talk can there be for beings about being bound?
For whom there is no bondage at all, for that which, hence,
Is already free - acting for freedom is nonsense.
By error one sees, through confusion's mistake,
A ghost in a shadow, in a rope a snake!
Don't be removing a thing, nor grasping for:
Stay as your authentic state - just as you are!


Best regards,

Hartmut Buescher
