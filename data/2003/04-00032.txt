Bhagavata Purana
Dear members of the list,
A couple of years ago (I think) I downloaded a PDF file with a
Devanagari version of the Bhagavatapurana. However, this file I have
lost, and I am now unable to locate its place of origin. Would any of
you know where it can be found?
Best regards,
Lars Martin Fosse
