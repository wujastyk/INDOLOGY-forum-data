Hello Patrick
I will be at the Bhartrhari conference (Dec 12-14) organized by Motilal Banarsidass, but will be leaving for Pune on the morning of Dec 15.  Are you planning to come to Pune?  I will be in Pune for about 10 days, and then return to US on Dec 29.
Madhav

	Madhav: That is OK. I understand. What conference are you attending
	in Delhi? The one organized by Madhu Kishwar on Indian Religions? If
	so, I'll also be there, so we can meet. Best,
	Patrick
