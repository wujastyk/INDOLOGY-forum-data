Thank you. I have the book on my shelf, but haven't read it yet. I'll pull

I have discussed in some detail the connection of the ZAkalya RV to the
MANDUkeya tradition in my article "Genesis of the RV Retroflexion" which
appeared in the volume Aryan and Non-Aryan in India edited by myself and
Peter E. Hook.  This article is also included in my book Sanskrit and
Prakrit: Sociolinguistic Issues.  The connection to Magadha is based on a
reference in the SAMkhAyana AraNyaka VII.13 (Keith's edn of the Aitareya
AraNyaka, p. 309) which says that Madhyama MANDUkeya, the son of PrAtibodhI,
was a MagadhavAsI "resident of Magadha.
