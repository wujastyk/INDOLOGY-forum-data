Hello Arlo,

Ruth Schmidt asked me to pass on the following comments on your
question:

*********

I never collected this lexical item, nor did Fussman.

If Phalura does not show the -ka-suffix, I would be surprised to find 
it in any of the accessible modern languages, since Phalura is by far 
the most archaic of the dialects (originating in Chilas, in the 
ancient center of the Shina-speaking zone). This is also the picture 
one gets from a glance at CDIAL. All the reflexes show the pattern 
k?l, k?lu [-u ~ -o is the suffix for a marked masculine noun], and 
that is what is borrowed into Burushaski. The dialects shown, though 
few, also span the range of Shina from west to east and south to 
north, with the exception of Brokskat. If the word is the same in 
Phalura, Gilgiti, Kohistani and Guresi, it will probably not differ 
in Chilasi, Astori or Drasi.

I have not found the -ka-suffix as such surviving in modern Shina, 
though Turner often needs it to show why the Shina reflex survives as 
a closed syllable, instead of being further reduced.

Regards,

Ruth
