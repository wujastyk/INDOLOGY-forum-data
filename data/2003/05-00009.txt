See F. Edgerton: Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit Grammar and Dictionary. Vol.
2: dictionary, p. 616a, s.v. Sva;sa
"n. of a people living about Taxila: Sva;sar-ajya.m Divy 372.11; surely
graphic corruption for Skt. Kha;sa or Kha.sa"

Edgerton refers to a passage in the Pamsupradanavadana which is a part
of the Asoka cycle. For references to the ethnic group called Kha;sa,
see, e.g., Soerensen's index of names in the Mahabharata, s.v. Kha,ca
[,c is c with cedille].

Hope it helps
