Catalogue of the Gandhari Corpus
The British Library/University of Washington Early Buddhist Manuscripts
Project has made available an electronic catalogue of Gandharan
inscriptions,
coins, manuscripts, and secular documents, as well as a bibliography of
secondary literature and studies relating to Gandhari.
http://depts.washington.edu/ebmp/inscriptions.php
These pages represent a work in progress. Scholars are invited to send in
additions and corrections to the data in the hopes that this will eventually
become a comprehensive catalogue of all known materials in and relating to
the Gandhari language.
