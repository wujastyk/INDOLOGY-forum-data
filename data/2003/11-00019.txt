Alas, I fear it is not so easy to avoid the viruddhamatik.rddo.sa of the
compound muktabodha. All the more a shame since the Muktabodha org.'s work seems
valuable.

What about muktalajja, muktakrodha, muktahar.sa, etc.?

To the contrary, the intended (vivak.sita) meaning of the compound is beside
the point in a viruddhamatik.rddo.sa, the problem is that there exists a
possible,   not intended (avivak.sita) repellent second meaning. For instance,
Mamma.ta (7.ex165) shows the repugnant, unintended second sense in the word
akaaryamitra: atra ``kaarya.m vinaa mitram'' iti vivak.sitam ``akaarye.su mitram''
iti tu pratiiti.h. Intended is ``friend without ulterior motive'', but the
unintended sense is ``partner in crime''.

At least for me the repugnant second sense (``stupid'') in Muktabodha is
embarrassing for an educational institution.
