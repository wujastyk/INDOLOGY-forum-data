Raghuva.m/sa commentary
Dear colleagues,
Can somebody tell me the approximative date/place of origin of
Aru.nagirin-atha the commentator of the Raghuva.m/sa, and if there is an
edition of his commentary (unfortunately we have not yet in our library the
first volume of Goodall & alii's Raghuva.m/sa new edition, which certainly
answers to my question). I discovered extracts of his commentary quoted in
T.K. Ramachandra Aiyar 's student edition of K-alid-asa's work (one canto
by fascicule) published in the "Sanskrit study made easy series" in Kerala.
I found also that C Panduranga Bhatta conducted researches on the
Raghuvam/sa in the light of this commentary during the eighties, but I do
not know if this scholar published something thereabout.
The commentary appears to be good: in 2.35, for example,  when the poet
alludes to  a certain Nikumbha, Aru.nagirin-atha gives what seems to me the
most relevant explanation, contra the one proposed by Vallabha (but with
the same reading as him), while Mallin-atha says nothing.
Thank you very much for your help
