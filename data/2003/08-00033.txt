Gold Coins
Thanks to all who replied to my query on gold coins in India. They
were VERY helpful. It appears that no "significant" gold currency
existed in India prior to Vima Kaphises and the subsequent Kushan
kings -- so the earliest about 90-100 CE. This is the view of Harry
Falk and Muneo Tokunaga [who also cites the view of P. L. Gupta in
his "Coins", Ch. 4]. This should be helpful to text scholars who are
in search of something to hang our chronological hats on! Thanks
again.
