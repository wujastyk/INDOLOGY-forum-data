The following, which he quotes from an answer
from R.P. Goldman, could be a starting point:
?As I have seen the verse, it is apparent that it
is from a version of the Ramayana story. Rama, it
appears, utters the verse to Lakshmana at some
point, probably in the Yuddhakanda. The full
verse runs:
Api svarnamayi lanka na me lakshmana rocate/
Janani janmabhumish casvargad api gariyasi//
I do not care for Lanka, Lakshmana, even though
it be made of gold.
One?s mother and one?s native land are worth more
even than heaven.?
?but I am not really sure, off the top of my
head, what the exact textual source is?I would
suggest checking other Sanskrit versions such as
the Ananda Ramayana, Kshemendra?s
Ramayanamanjari, Campuramayana etc.?
