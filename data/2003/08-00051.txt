"M?hp?reh" literally means: a piece (p?reh) of the moon (m?h).   It is a
Persian expression meaning the beauty, belle.



In Persian literature m?h (moon) is not only a symbol of beauty but also of
time and cycle, "the ocean of time."



Perhaps, Chandra-kal? (a digit of the moon) often personified as a beautiful
female divinity.
