ID needed of Oxbridge foundation
Several years ago at AAS or AOS I attended a presentation on a research
foundation that had recently been established in Cambridge or Oxford,
whose basic library was that of some distinguished British scholar of
South Asia. I thought I had recorded the address but find I haven't, and
can't remember the name.  Could anyone help me out?
Thanks,
Allen
