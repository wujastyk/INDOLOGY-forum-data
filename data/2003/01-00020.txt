an injustice
Dear Colleagues,
In the same spirit in which many of us spoke out against the injustice
visited on our colleague Yigal Bronner, I would like to draw your attention
to an equally unacceptable action taken recently in Paris. Please take a
moment, if you wish, to visit
http://217.174.203.80/contreleboycott/
or
http://contreleboycott.free.fr/
(I used the latter URL, but it appears to automatically turn into the
former).
Thank you for considering academic freedom and interchange to be a universal
good, not to be sacrificed to the political winds of the moment.

PS:  If you would like to pass on the above information to others, I am sure
it would help.
