Thanks, but no, that is not it.  The poem I remember (?) has a nostalgic feeling, saying goodbye to a world that, in some sense, will be missed.  The Nirvana Satakam celebrates nirvana, does not linger on the threshold to wave goodbye. I have begun to suspect I am confounding some Chinese or Japanese Buddhist tradition with Sankara.
