"prabhakara and dhvani" reference
My teacher K. Srinivasan recently mentioned to me that he had once seen a 
publication entitled ?Prabhaakara and Dhvani? published, he thought, from 
Vikram University in Ujjain.  However, he could not recall the author?s name 
or indeed whether it was a monograph or an article.  If anyone could pass 
alone the particulars, I would be very grateful.  I do not currently have 
access to Timothy C. Cahill, An Annotated Bibliography of the 
Alamkarazaastra.  Handbuch der Orientalistik. Zweite Abteilung. Indien ; 14. 
Bd.  Leiden: Brill, 2001.
Thanks much,
Whitney Cox
