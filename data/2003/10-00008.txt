Dear Professor,
For religious practices to cure infertality I suggest my recent publication "Upasana-citAmaNi" Vol.I entitled Mantra-Prayoga in two Parts.There is a chapter on SantAna-GopAla-Vidhi to cure four types of barrenhood KAka-bandhyA,Lupta-vastA,StrI-prajA and BandhyA.The book is published by Chaukhamba Sanskrit Pratisthan,Delhi,2003. This book is in four Volumes (eight Parts).
I hope it will help your student.

Dear members of the list,

A student has asked me for references to texts etc. on Hinduism and
infertility/childlessness for a research project. Her keywords are
"texts, religious practices, rules, norms etc". If any of you could be
of any help, I will forward your answers to her.

Best regards,

Lars Martin Fosse
