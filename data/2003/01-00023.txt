facsimile editions
These series have all been microfilmed and are, in principle, available
to buy on film.  See

I would be very interested to know the current status of this great
project, and the materials that were gathered.  Anyone know? Am I right in
thinking that through The Digital South Asia Library project
(http://dsal.uchicago.edu/), these materials will be made available under
the title "The Indological Series Database", as an NEH-funded project
located at the U. of Chicago? (Apparently providing efficient searching of
published editions of texts in a database of some 25,000 records.)
Best,
Dominik
