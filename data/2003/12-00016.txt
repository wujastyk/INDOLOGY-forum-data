Dear Stephen,

I'm not sure if you've managed to locate a copy of Excel yet. If you
have, I wanted to let you know that I've recently updated the sort
coding macro that I use to sort Sanskrit and Gandhari text. It will now
sort Tibetan, and can perform conversions to Devanagari and some other
things. The interface is not also, a little more user-friendly.

The file is available as a txt file from my web page:
http://staff.washington.edu/asg/pages/fonts.html
under the heading VBA Macros for Indologists.

Best wishes,

Andrew
