Sanskrit word order sort program
Dear Stephen,
I'm not sure if you've managed to locate a copy of Excel yet. If you
have, I wanted to let you know that I've recently updated the sort
coding macro that I use to sort Sanskrit and Gandhari text. It will now
sort Tibetan, and can perform conversions to Devanagari and some other
things. The interface is not also, a little more user-friendly.
The file is available as a txt file from my web page:

under the heading VBA Macros for Indologists.
Best wishes,
Andrew
