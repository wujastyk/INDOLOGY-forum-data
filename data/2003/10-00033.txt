The best person to ask about this is Robert Goldman, who has studied them
intensively as part of his work on the Princeton translation of the Critical
Edition of the R-am-aya,na.  However, here are some initial reactions.
The general consensus is that the Tilaka commentary was written by N-age'sa
Bha.t.ta; why the CC suggests otherwise is unclear to me.
Since this is one of the older commentaries, the earlier date seems more
likely than the later.
The R-am-aya.na'siroma.ni is generally ascribed to Va.m's-idhara
'Sivasah-aya and this seems consistent with its opening verses.
