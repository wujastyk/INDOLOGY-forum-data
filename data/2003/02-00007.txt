Intro to Veda: texts, myth, ritual, religion (on web)
As there is so much misinformation out on the web
about earliest / Vedic India
(do a Google search!),
I have now decided to put out a 100 pp. long paper
with BASIC introductory information
on Vedic texts, religion, mythology and ritual.
http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~witzel/VedicHinduism.htm
as pdf:   http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~witzel/vedica.pdf
This  was composed jointly by S. Jamison and me, way back in 1992, and
privately  among students and colleagues.  It will be updated, eventually,
to cover the past 10 years or so of scholarship.
A much shorter (almost equally dated) version will finally come out in a
vol. ed. by
A. Sharma: The Study of Hinduism.  U. of SC Press 2003 (?)
Enjoy, MW
