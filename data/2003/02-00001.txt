SUMMER SCHOOL IN SPOKEN SANSKRIT 2003
The Summer School in Spoken Sanskrit organized by the Department of
Classical Indology at the South Asia Institute, Heidelberg, entering its
fourth consecutive year, once again offers the opportunity, particularly
to those pursuing Indological Studies, to expand the range of their use
of this extraordinarily rich language: Under the tutelage of a Sanskrit
native speaker, Shri Sadanada Das, students with a basic training in
Sanskrit grammar and translation shall learn to carefully listen, to
accurately pronounce and to slowly speak and recite it. The four-week,
all-day course in simple conversation will help strengthen language
skills and make the study of Sanskrit a playful and creative experience.
