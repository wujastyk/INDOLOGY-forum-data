B?htlingk?s Indische Spr?che (plus August Blau?s index in
Abhandlungen f?r die Kunde des Morgenlandes IX.4) and Sternbach?s
Mah??subh??ita?sa?graha (to the extent available, i.e., a through
g?) can help.  At least they served me well in a similar
situation, tracking down the Sanskrit inscription on Rasmus Rask?s
gravestone; full report here:

It still takes a lot of digging, though.
Best wishes,
