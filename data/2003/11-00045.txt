help in finding a vesya--well, a book anyway
Have you checked out the bibliography of his works in The Ludwik
Sternback Felicitation Volume (Lucknow: Akhila Bharatiya Sanskrit
Parishad, 1979, v. 1 p. 25-56)?

Friends,
I have been looking to see a copy of Sternbach's work on Vesya:
Synonyms and Aphorisms. I am afraid that even the exact publication
data are not quite clear to me. There seems to have been a book, and
then several articles supplementing it (but even this I am not
entirely sure about). Any hints about the publication details, and
where actual copies might be found, would be appreciated.
thanks so much, jonathan
PS:  this I *think* is quite different from a book I do have before
me: Ga.nikaa-v.tta-sa.mgraha.h or Texts on Courtezans in Classical
Sanskrit. But perhaps the latter is a compilation of the former
materials? (If so, I miss what he somewhere claims is a compilation
of over 330 synonyms for vezyaa...)
