The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is <BR>
seeking India's help to study and decipher the massive amounts of <BR>
data on earth sciences from a confluence of satellites. <BR>
BANGALORE: Numerous U.S. satellites studying changes in the Earth, R>
oceans and atmosphere have been pumping in huge quantities of data.<
&quot;The most difficult thing we find is understanding the meaning of the
data for meteorological prediction. This is one major area in which
India's experts can help NASA,&quot; says Jim Dodge, programme director of <BR>
earth sciences at the U.S. space agency.<BR>
<BR>
Delivering a &quot;vision&quot; talk at the space summit organised as a part of <BR>
the 90th Indian Science Congress here, Dodge pointedly mentioned the <BR>
expertise of Indians in meteorology, mathematics, physics and other <BR>
disciplines for the study of data from satellites.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We are right now swimming with new data that could predict the <BR>
future. Our focus, like the Indian space programme, is also on <BR>
meeting the societal needs in the next two decades,&quot; Dodge added.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The drivers are no more technology, but scientific. How the global <BR>
Earth system is changing and how the Earth responds to natural and <BR>
human-induced changes are some questions.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The urgency in doing the &quot;massive job of distilling data&quot; emanates <BR>
from the fact that there is a demand for providing the information on <BR>
a personal computer. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The challenge for the future is really analysis of data,&quot; Dodge said.<BR>
<BR>
But it is not only the U.S. that is seeking India's cooperation in <BR>
space technology and applications. China, Thailand, Malaysia and the <BR>
European Space Agency are all looking for strengthening their ties <BR>
with India.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We have a memorandum of understanding with India. But we are still <BR>
in the exploratory stage. We don't know where it will be headed <BR>
finally,&quot; an official of the Chinese space agency told IANS.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We have the capacity to launch big satellites, but India has <BR>
expertise in remote sensing and Earth sciences.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Suvit Vibulshresth of Thailand's Geo-Informatics and Space Technology <BR>
Development Agency (GISTDA) told the space summit: &quot;Thailand is <BR>
already receiving images from the Indian remote sensing satellite. <BR>
And we are awaiting the launch of Cartosat to receive higher density <BR>
images. We also hope India can help us build a small satellite. <BR>
<BR>
Added Antonio Rodata, director of the European Space Agency: &quot;We have <BR>
been cooperating with India for 25 years. We are now having talks for <BR>
cooperation in disaster management.&quot;<BR>
