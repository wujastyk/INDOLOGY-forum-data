jaya = 108?
I have never seen this explanation of 'jaya' before; but the assignment of
the value 8 and 1 to ja and ya, respectively (according to the rule aGkAnAM
vAmato gatiH) follows the well-known kaTapayAdi system: consonants are
arranged in series beginning with k, T, p, and y, where the first letter in
a series has the value 1, the second the value 2, etc.
