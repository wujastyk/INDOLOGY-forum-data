adoption & marriage: legal question
A wife can be also appointed by her sonless husband (because he is impotent
or ill), or a sonless widow can be appointed, to give up to 2 sons to him
conceiving them either with a sapinda or sagotra of her husband, or with his
brother (levirate). To appoint a putrikA is just one of the kinds of niyoga.
In Italy, aristocratic families sometimes adopt the daughter's husband in
order to give him the family name and perpetuate it. It is a legal adoption.
