Dear Joanna,
Not much additional advice re: animals & birds Sanskrit and biological names.
As far as botany is concerned, my constant companion is:
Chopra R.N., Nayar S.L., Chopra I.C., Glossary of Indian Medicinal Plants,
Council of Scientific & Industrial Research, New Delhi 1956, 330 pages. (On
pp. 263-318 Index of Common Vernacular Names [including Sanskrit])
and
Chopra R.N., Chopra I.C., Varma B.S., Supplement to Glossary of Indian
Medicinal Plants, Publications & Information Directorate, New Delhi 1969,
120 pages.
No photographs or drawings of the plants, though. Which is annoying. But
otherwise a mine of dependable information.
Regards,
Artur Karp
