Preliminary bibliography focused on "Saantideva
Dear Colleagues,
[I apologise to subscribers to H-Buddhism for cross posting]
Drawing on Gomez[1], Potter[2] and Tsukamoto et al.[3], together with
my own notes, I have collated a preliminary bibliography focused on
"Saantideva:
  http://homepages.comnet.co.nz/~r-mahoney/biblio/biblio.html
The bibliography is divided into sections:
 1) Manuscripts & editions
     http://homepages.comnet.co.nz/~r-mahoney/biblio/bca_ed.html
 2) Translations
     http://homepages.comnet.co.nz/~r-mahoney/biblio/bca_trans.html
 3) Secondary literature
     http://homepages.comnet.co.nz/~r-mahoney/biblio/bca_second.html
It is my hope that these details might form the basis for an accurate,
up to date database of materials concerning "Saantideva. A form is
available for the submission of corrections and additions:
  http://homepages.comnet.co.nz/~r-mahoney/biblio/biblio-input.html
If you notice any mistakes in the BibTeX databases, or know of papers
not included, please do not hesitate to use this form.
Best regards,
 Richard Mahoney
