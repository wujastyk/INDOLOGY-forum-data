SV: penance
I would like to thank Aarlo Griffiths for this interesting piece. I
recently saw a young Norwegian faqir on TV doing these things (sticking
hooks through his back skin and then hoist himself up in the air to hang
there for the rest of the program. In other words, what is religious
penance in some places is entertainment in others. What I am curious
about, is this: are there any studies of persons who do this sort of
thing? Is this a thing "anybody" can do provided s/he has the willpower,
or do such persons have a reduced sense of pain which allows them to
perform such acts? In a religious context, is there any kind of abnormal
mental state involved? If anybody on the net knows anything about this,
I would be curious to hear the answer!
Best regards,
Lars Martin Fosse
