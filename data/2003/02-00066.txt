Documentary on Max Mueller
Dear Prof Witzel,
Going to the URLs given here tells me nothing about the MM broadcast. This
URL gets a 404
http://www.dw-world.de/dwelle/cda/detail/dwelle.cda.detail.download/0,3830,5
0167
Could you maybe refine these links a bit more? This one accessed just now
says nothing about a forthcoming program on  MM --
http://www.dw-world.de/english
How did you find this out?  maybe on short wave? Please be more specific as
to where to find this program tomorrow.
Thanks
Joanna Kirkpatrick
