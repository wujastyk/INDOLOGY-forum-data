Dear Colleagues,

Now that the measured statement by Prosser Gifford, Director of Scholarly
Programs at the Library of Congress, on the appointment of Professor Thapar
to a Kluge Chair at the Library of Congress has been posted to our list by
Allen Thrasher and David Magier, it is time for the discussion of this topic
on-list to come to an end.  Those interested in pursuing it further can of
course do so by the means suggested in various of the messages that have
been posted in the course of the discussion.

Yours

John Brockington
