introduction and a question
Dr. Collins,
Perhaps you mean the final verse of Bhart.rhari's Vairaagya"sataka (Chowkambha
ed.):
maatar medini taataa maaruta sakhe teja.h subandho jala
bhraatar vyoma nibaddha eva bhavataam antya.h pra.naanaa~njali.h |
yu.smatsa"ngava"sopajaatasuk.rtasphaarasphurannirmala-
j~naanaapaastasamastamohamahimaa liiye parabrahma.ni ||
In Ingalls' translation (An Anthology of Sanskrit Court Poetry, p 12):
My father wind and you my mother earth,
Fire, my friend, water, my near relation
And you my brother sky; in this last breath
Of mortal life I send you salutation.
