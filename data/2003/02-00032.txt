The more I've used Dave, the less I would agree with Das's caveat.  Dave
really had an excellent personal knowledge of Indian ornithology, which
makes his book uniquely useful, and his opinions far more valuable than if
they were merely based on secondary academic sources alone.  (Of course,
he is very widely and usefully read in Sanskrit sources.)  If Dave appears
sure, it is often because he does actually know what he's talking about.
:-)

Obviously, there is never any excuse for not thinking for oneself.  I'm
not saying Dave is perfect, just very, very good, and perhaps unfairly
criticised by Das.  Also, unfortunately, out of print.
