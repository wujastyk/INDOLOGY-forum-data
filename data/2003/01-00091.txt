 Obituary
Herewith I send sad news.
My colleague, Professor Katsuhiko Kamimura died on 24 January at the age
of fifty-eight.
He had developed a cancer of the prostate. The operation was successful.
But his mental state became worse and worse and he was determined to die.
In these fifteen years he has been translating the Mahabharata into
Japanese. The translation of the first Adi Parvan was published in January
2002 and in October 2002 the sixth Bhisma Parvan was published.
Thus the activity of the translation of the Mahabharata was again
interrupted by a sudden death of the translator.
The funeral service will take place at Denbouin in Sensouji temple on 30
January from 12:00 to 14:00.
