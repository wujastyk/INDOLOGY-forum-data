Subject: colour of biestings of Indian cow???
Message-ID: <161227072269.23782.10509648891661149598.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I have not seen the biestings of Indian cows directly, but I have eaten numerous times in Pune a sweet thinkened milk dish made out of it that is called kharvas in Marathi.  It always looked a little yellowish, never greenish or redish.

                                                Madhav
