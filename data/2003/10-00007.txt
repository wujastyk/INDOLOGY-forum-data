Dear members of the list,

A student has asked me for references to texts etc. on Hinduism and
infertility/childlessness for a research project. Her keywords are
"texts, religious practices, rules, norms etc". If any of you could be
of any help, I will forward your answers to her.

Best regards,

Lars Martin Fosse
