A similar notice of this alleged bridge relic appeared on the risa-l list in
November, so I looked up the various posted views of the area. One of these
views suggested to me that someeone had tampered with the photo to make it
look more like a bridge "on" the shoal. Take a good look at the second photo
on the following website, to see obvious evidence of image-tampering in the
form of regular sized little strokes that appear to imitate stones:
