2002 publication by Ludwik Sternbach?
Dear Friends
Has anyone ever heard of this publication:
Hindu Legends of Justice: Panchatantra and Smrti, L. Sternback
(=Sternbach?), New Delhi, Global Vision Pub. 2002?
The most recent work by Sternbach that I can find is 1980. Could it be a
reprint of old work? I can find no old works of his by that title. Or is
there really a L Sternback?
With thanks in advance.
