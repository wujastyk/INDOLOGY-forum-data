adoption & marriage: legal question
Allen:
The husband inherits the putrikaa's property from her father only in
the event she dies without issue. Putrikaa, in my understanding, is
clearly the owner of the inherited property, and not merely holding
it for her son. Jolly's Tagore Lectures made this point very clearly.
Of course, ancestral property, according to Indian law, could not be
alienated even by the father; the sons have an interest in it.
