Digitization centre of Sanskrit texts

In a way, that's just what GRETIL was intended for. A "news centre"
registering - and perhaps coordinating - all ongoing activities could
be set up in no time at all. In case anyone is interested, please let
me know.
By the way, if you would like to register e-texts in Indian languages,
or know of e-texts that have not been registered in GRETIL so far,
I'd bee much obliged if you would drop me a line.
One more thing: Some of you may have noticed that all GRETIL files
have at last been converted to UTF-8. However, I'm not so sure
whether I should also convert them to a 7-bit encoding along the
lines of the ATIL scheme, as announced in December. If you have an
opinion on this, please let me know (off-list?).
Best regards
