You can download two Perl programs (to run from terminal) from John Smith's
ftp site that will sort entries into the CSX+ order of the Sanskrit alphabet.
They are called ``ssort'' and ``ssort.unix'':

If you use a Macintosh I can send you a Perl filter to run from the ``text
filters'' menu in ``BBedit'' that does the same for the encoding of the Norman
typeface.
