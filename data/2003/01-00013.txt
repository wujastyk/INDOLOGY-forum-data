Subject: Buddhism as Iranian heresy?
Message-ID: <161227071618.23782.15884825366400368607.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

An Iranian heresy? I think that is "off the wall," as they say. Not that
it was not an Indic heresy, as it long remained, making fro cdreative
ferment and debate in the subcontinent!
