Dear Colleagues,
                the Newar Buddhists of the Kathmandu Valley conclude a month of intense devotional practice on the au.msii day of Bhadra (i.e. the last day of k.r.s.na pak.sa, that is, the day preceding the new moon). One explanation for this date is that the present Kaliyuga is to come to its end on such an au.msii day of Bhadra. Prof. Gert Wegner, on whose behalf I submit this question, would be grateful for any reference confirming this "dating" of the end of the Kaliyuga.
Thanks and regards,
                                Alexander v. Rospatt
