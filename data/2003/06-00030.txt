Greetings:
    I am posting this on behalf of Francis Clooney, Academic Director of the
Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies.


The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies, an independent Centre seeking
affiliation with the University, announces a Visiting Fellowship during
January-April 2004. The Fellowship includes a small monthly stipend, a place
to live, and office facilities. The visiting fellow is also afforded access
to Oxford's libraries and research resources, seminars, etc. He or she is
expected to be in residence during the fellowship period, and during that
time to offer one Centre seminar and one public lecture. Otherwise, the
scholar is entirely free to pursue personal research projects. Cover
letter, including a description of current research project/s, and a current
CV, required. These may be sent by post (OCHS, 15 Magdalen Street, Oxford,
OX1 3AE, UK) or by email attachment (info at ocvhs.com)
Applications accepted at any time; the award will be made after August
1, 2003. For information on the Centre, go to
