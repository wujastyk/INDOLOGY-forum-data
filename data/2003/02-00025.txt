at risk again
Not being an expert, I still try. Can anyone point me to a Sanskrit source
that gives translations into English of animal names in Skt to their common
or biological or both names in English?
Not much of Indian birds or flowers in Monier-Williams it seems, nor on the
Capeller online or Cologne online lookup machines.
Thanks
