Papers are inited for the following panel at the 18th European
Conference on Modern South Asian Studies, to be held at Lund, Sweden,

South Asian languages in linguistic focus

The focus of this paper is the analytical treatment of language.
Papers may analyze features of any modern or ancient South Asian
language (some examples: analysis of the phonology, morphology or
syntax of an Indo-Aryan, Dravidian or Munda language), or analyze
historical linguistic or sociolinguistic aspects of modern South
Asian languages (some examples: historical development of a South
Asian language; language use in instruction, language use in ethnic
or regional politics, endangered languages and so on). Papers will be
based on linguistic, sociolinguistic, historical linguistic, lexical
or textual data, and employ an accredited theoretical framework from
some field of linguistics or philology.

Abstracts of papers should be submitted to the panel convenors:

Vit Bubenik: vbubenik at morgan.ucs.mun.ca
Ruth Schmidt: r.l.schmidt at east.uio.no

The deadline for submission of abstracts is 1 February, 2004

Please distribute this invitation on other relevant lists.

Best regards,

Lars Martin Fosse
