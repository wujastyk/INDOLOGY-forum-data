Dear List Manager,

 

One of my graduate students here at Indiana University, Ms. Rhonda
Baird, would like to subscribe to the Indology list.  Can you sign her
up?  Her email address is Rhonda [river_bird_1 at yahoo.com].

 

I know that in the past it's been difficult for students to sign on, and
that's why I'm seeking your assistance.

 

Thank you,
