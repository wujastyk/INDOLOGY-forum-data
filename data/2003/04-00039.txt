Through a generous endowment from John W Kluge, the Library of
Congress established the center in 2000 to bring together the world's
best thinkers to stimulate, energise, and distil wisdom from the
library's rich resources and to interact with policy makers in
Washington, DC.
The center houses five senior Kluge Chairs.
The petitioners say: "It is a great travesty that Romila Thapar has
been appointed the first holder of the Kluge Chair.
"In regards to India, she is an avowed antagonist of India's Hindu
civilization as a well-known Marxist. She represents a completely
Euro-centric worldview. I fail to see how she can be the correct
choice to represent India's ancient history and civilization.
"She completely disavows that India ever had a history. The ongoing
campaign by Romila Thapar and others to discredit Hindu civilization
is a war of cultural genocide. By your unfortunate selection of
Thapar, America is now aiding and abetting this effort."
The petition has 133 signatures already. One of the signatories, Hari
Singh, said: "The comments from Ms Thapar are disgusting and are
reflection of her ignorance of Indian History."
Venkatesh, another signatory, commented, "It's a shame to the USA &
Indian govt. that a Communist like Romila Thapar is having a free run."
