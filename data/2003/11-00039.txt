     Skt tenses and moods
Dear Vyaakara.nas'iroma.naya.h,
M.R. Kale's A Higher Sanskrit Grammar, ch. XII, p. 238,
divides the ten lakaara into six tenses -- kaalaa.h --
and four moods -- arthaa.h .
I would be grateful for references to passages in the
major classical grammars (Mahaabhaa.sya, etc.), or vulgar
Sanskrit grammars (e.g. Saarasvata) in which this
particular distinction occurs or is explained.
(Though Kale sometimes supports himself with an exact
citation, he's not done so here.)
with thanks for your attention,
