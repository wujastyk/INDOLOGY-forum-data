Sanskrit word order sort program
We have a Sanskrit sort program but have not yet posted it at our
website.  We have plans to post this and other programs at
sanskritlibrary.org and will do so soon.  We'll post an announcement
when it is publicly available.  If you have a Perl environment
installed, we can send you the program to run locally in the
meantime.  We conduct sorting in a phonological encoding and
transliterate to and from it from Harvard-Kyoto, CSX, and Unicode
encodings.
