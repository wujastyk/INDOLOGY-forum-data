In my edition of AS, Vaidyanaatha Aayurveda Bhavana Praaivet. Li.,
Naagapura, 1989 (1st printing)), with vyaakhyaa by Laalacandra"saastrii
Vaidya and intro. by Raghuviiraprasaada Trivedii, the vers you want is in
Sarirasthana 5.93:

siraadhamaniimukhaanaa.m tva.nu"so
vibhajyamaanaanaamekonatri.m"sacchatasahasraa.ni nava ca "sataani
.sa.tpa~ncaa"saani bhavanti|
taabhirida.m "sariira.m gavaak.sita.m pinaddhamaatata.m ca ||93||


In Kimjavadekar's 1938 ed, this is verse "saa.5.115, and it reads the
same.

Best,
