animals
One might also mention that Stephanie Jamison, in various publications, has
dealt with the precise identification of Sanskrit animal-names: the first
thing that comes to my mind is her book on the Ravenous Hyenas and the
Wounded Sun, esp. pp. 68ff. (on hyenas). Then, I think of Claudius
Nenninger's paper in StII 18 [1993] (on the nakula-). There is also a very
interesting recent paper by Joshua Katz in the Insler Festschrift, JAOS
122.2 [2002] (on badgers, moles [not in India!] etc.).
All these works make clear that identifications commonly used by Indologists
can in many cases already be rejected for the simple reason that the
supposed animal does not exist in India. Regarding Dave's book on birds, we
should indeed, as Karttunen just hinted, not forget R.P. Das' words
("Studies in Indian Medical History", ed. by Meulenbeld and Wujastyk,
Groningen 1987, p. 27 n. 36): "... Dave seems on the whole far too sure of
his identifications and has moreover more or less neglected other studies on
the subject."
