Sanskrit word order sort program ?
Does anybody know if there is a program around for sorting romanized
Sanskrit into correct dictionary order.  I have a tri-lingual (Skt/Ch/Tib)
index containing 30,000+ entries that I need to sort for sanskrit.
I'd be grateful for any pointers
Best wishes,
Stephen Hodge
