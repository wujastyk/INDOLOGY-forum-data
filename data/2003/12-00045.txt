help with Simhala script ms
Another library has sent me photocopies of two pages of a Simhala script
palmleaf manuscript, whose contents they have no idea of.  Our Simhala
cataloger is unable to read it.  The script is highly cursive but to my
eye neat and potentially legible.  Is there anyone who could help the
library find out what it is so that it may be cataloged?
