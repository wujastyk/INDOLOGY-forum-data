Dear colleagues,
I am searching for the following book:
V.N. Hari Rao, Koil Olugu. The Chronicle of the Srirangam Temple with
Historical Notes. Madras: Rochouse and Sons, 1961.
Searches in the Karlsruhe Virtual Catalog achieved no results.
Does any of your libraries possess this book?
Yours sincerely,
