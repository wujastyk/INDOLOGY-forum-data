Dear Lars Martin Fosse,
what kind of studies are you looking for?  My unpublished MA
dissertation (SOAS 1999) was about one particular group of
word?order phenomena in Da??in?s Da?akum?racarita, but you may
find it emphasises the linguistic side more than the textual.  I?d
be happy to send you a PDF file if you?d like.
Best regards,
