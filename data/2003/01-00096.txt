> Query regarding internal sibilant-sandhi after the i-vowel:

> viSabhAgAnAM in the phrase "visabhAgAnAM sabhAgAnAM ca karmaNAM" ("...of

> My five manuscripts (which all are from Nepal) consistently use the form

> without the retroflex sibilant after the i-vowel. In the edition

> published by La Vall?e Poussin, the form viSabhAgAnAm has been
> adopted/emended, which also seems to be in accordance with the internal
> sandhi-rules for the dental sibilant after the i-vowel (cf. e.g. Whitney's
> grammar ?180 and ?185a). Nevertheless, in his text-critical notes to the
> text, de Jong adopts the spelling visabhAgAnAm, i.e. retains the dental
> sibilant after the i-vowel, with a reference to the Japanese
> translation of
> the text by Wogihara, which is a source I unfortunately do not have access
