introduction and a question
Sri Atmananda, Krishna Menon, was a great sage of a couple of generations ago, semi-famous for a while among Europeans, though with a large Indian following as well. His son, Sri Padmanabha Menon, Sri Adwayananda, was my teacher.  He died three years ago.  Sri Padmanabha Menon's son, who is rumored to be the successor, still lives in the family home in Malakara, near Chengannur, not too far from Kotayam, on the Pamba river about equidistant from Trivandrum and Cochin.  You can read about Atmananda in Arthur Koestler's book The Lotus and the Robot, in Joseph Campbell, and in Jeff Masson's My Father's Guru.  He is identified as Gurunathan in the last reference. Raja Rao, the novelist, was Atmananda's disciple, and it was through Raja (then teaching at the University of Texas) that I met his son. An "experimental" school started by Sri Adwayananda's disciples and called the Sri Atmananda Memorial School, is operating in Malakara.  It has had very positive notice by national educ
ational officials.  A branch has opened in Austin, Texas.
You might have heard of Krsna Menon as the "police saint of Malabar."  He was a police officer, I believe stationed in Trivandrum.  At any rate, Campbell met him at a Trivandrum hotel and that is where European disciples stayed (before my time).  There was an article in the Kerala papers that I saw after Sri Adwayananda passed with some history.
