> Dear Colleagues:
        My apologies to those who have seen this posted on another list.
        I'm interested in hearing people's responses as to what they consider
the best work on Mughal history. I am also interested more particularly
in references to works which deal in some detail with Akbar's
din-i-Ilahi religion.
        Many thanks in advance for any references given.

Best Wishes,
Brad Clough
