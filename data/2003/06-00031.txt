Mughal History and Akbar
        My apologies to those who have seen this posted on another list.
        I'm interested in hearing people's responses as to what they consider
the best work on Mughal history. I am also interested more particularly
in references to works which deal in some detail with Akbar's
din-i-Ilahi religion.
        Many thanks in advance for any references given.
Best Wishes,
