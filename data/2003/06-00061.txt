Dear List,

I have been asked about the term 'nerdiludium' which appears to refer to a
game of dice of some sort.   I see in Mayrhofer reference to 'narditam',
'schlectester Wurf', and to a 'Nard-Spieles', ein Wuerfelspiel.  I do not
have access to Lueders or to Falk at the moment.

Can someone give a description of the Persian game of the tables
[backgammon?}, nard or nardshir, and/or references to this?

Thanks in advance,

George Thompson
