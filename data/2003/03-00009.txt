Digitization centre of Sanskrit texts
Dear Dr. Reinhold Gruenendahl
Gruenen> In a way, that's just what GRETIL was intended for. A "news centre"
Thank you for your reply. I find GRETIL is quite useful as a register
of available e-texts in Indian languages. Also, I agree with your
principles such as ``plain text file preferable,'' ``a scholarly
reference aid for a given text,'' etc. for e-texts.
I guess you pay a good attention to various sites in the world
perpetually, and we owe you for it. (the Divyaavadaana is already in
it, although I have not reported to the net yet. But it misses the
Zakuntalaa.) I will inform you directly when I release a revised
version of an older e-text or a new e-text on my site:
http//tiger.bun.kyoto-u.ac.jp/mtokunag/skt_texts. I hope others, too.

Do you mean you have no idea of such a ``new center'' in Goettingen?
It is almost necessary for those who who work on a new e-text, but, I
admit, it's not easy to register, let alone, to coordinate ongoing
activities of digitization in the world --- a topic in WSC12?

No problem for a general user like me.
So much on this net.
With best regards,
