Hinduism and infertility/childlessness
The topic of adoption would be pertinent because it would usually be as
a result of infertility (at least the partial infertility of not
producing sons).  So would that of niyoga, which would be employed even
during the husband's lifetime when it was suspected that the infertility
was on the male side.  These would be treated in any of the Hindu
lawbooks and secondary sources.  I presume Kane, History of Dharmasastra
would have sections on both, and would treat of the ritual of adoption
as well.  The following titles are on the (Ango-)Hindu law of adoption
and would presumably give sources in the Dharmasastras and commentaries:

Also, Lars, I will send you separately a bibliography on infertility in
Ayurveda and Siddha, in case your student cares to look through these
works to see if they prescribe any religious cures as well as medical
ones.  It would be too long for the list's guidelines.

Dear members of the list,
A student has asked me for references to texts etc. on Hinduism and
infertility/childlessness for a research project. Her keywords are
"texts, religious practices, rules, norms etc". If any of you could be
of any help, I will forward your answers to her.
Best regards,
Lars Martin Fosse
