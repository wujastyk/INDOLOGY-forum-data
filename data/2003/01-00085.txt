Dear Richard,

Thank you for this nice initiative. I have tried to download your files,
but I have a problem: when I try to save them on my harddisk (I have a
Windows XP system), capital and small letters are treated in the same
way, which means that I only get e.g. a.html (small a) but not the file
named with a capital A. In this way, a few files disappear for me. Any
suggestions?

Lars Martin Fosse
