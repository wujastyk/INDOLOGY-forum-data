Namaskar and Nationalism
As I was growing up in Pune, it was my distinct impression that the term namaskar was used as a greeting term mostly by Brahmins to each other.  After my father retired, he built a house in the village of Dhayari near Pune, where our house was surrounded mostly by non-Brahmin folks.  Their normal form of greeting was to say "raam raam".  During my own visits to this village, it often happened that I would say namaskar to someone and he would respond saying raam raam to me.  It is my general impression that the term namaskar became the common term in urban areas of Maharashtra, while raam raam still remains the common term in rural areas.  Best,
