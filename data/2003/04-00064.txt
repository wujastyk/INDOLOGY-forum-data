Romila Thapar appointed Kluge Chair in Countries and Cultures              of the South at Library of Congress
Sir,
I thuink tht Romila Thaper is the apt person for the post in the Kluge Chair
in Countries and Cultures of  the South at Library of Congress.Any movement
against the appointment by the Hindu fenatics is na attack against the
accadamic freedsom .So at any rate accadaqmisions and Reserchers in whole
field of knowledge should ,react to the attack at any rate.
