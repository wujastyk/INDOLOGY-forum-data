XML/TEI-Sanskrit texts, anyone?
        My colleague Malcolm Hyman and I are putting the texts in our
Sanskrit Library in XML using Perl scripts to convert underlying
sandhi-analyzed texts.  The texts include Ramopakhyana, Visnupurana
Amsa 4, Purnabhadra's Pancatantra, Panini's Astadhyayi, Nirukta and
may be applied to the other texts in the grammatical database
assembled under the direction of George Cardona which were entered in
sandhi-analyzed format a decade ago.
        We will be posting Whitney's Verbal Roots shortly.
