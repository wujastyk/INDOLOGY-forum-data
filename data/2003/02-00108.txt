Although not based on TEI the following system is perhaps worth
testing:
 http://tbookdtd.sourceforge.net/
It can generate high quality LaTeX, HTML, XHTML, and DocBook output
from a single UTF8 XML source file. The author is also open to
suggestions. When I first used the system it didn't support the
standard diacritics needed for romanized Sanskrit. I asked the author
if support could be added and a few hours latter it was there. It is
also simple to add support for additional characters oneself.
