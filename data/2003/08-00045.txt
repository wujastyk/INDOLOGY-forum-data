See Virginia Saunders, ?Portrait Painting as a Dramatic Device in
Sanskrit Plays?, JAOS 39, 1919, 299-302. I have not the article at hand,
but the use of pictures causing people to fall in love is found both in
dramas and in narrative literature (e.g. Kathasaritsagara). In the play
Ratnavali the picture reveals the secret affair of the king to his head queen.
