Vishvanath Temple
I am only aware of the fact that the Vishvanatha Temple was opened to
untouchables in 1956. Svami Karpatri (Dharm Sangh, Durga Kund) and his Ram
Rajya Party protested against this and a New Kashi Vishvanatha Temple was
constructed with the help of the Maharaja at Mir Ghat.
If one looks at regulations one should also take the vyavahara into
consideration: I know of resident Non-Hindus and Non-Hindu members of
pilgrimage groups who were allowed to enter the temple.
