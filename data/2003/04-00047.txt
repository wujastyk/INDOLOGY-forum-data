Under the premises that I should update my Google's email address, the
request of Prof. Guha, and other colleagues whose msgs are fwd to me by
others, gives me the opportunity to repeat that my new email address is
garzilli at asiatica.org

Moreover, at the bottom of every single Asiatica Association, IJTS & IJTS
page it is written:

?1995-2002 Asiatica Association. All Rights Reserved
site development L. Magnocavallo / site comments E. Garzilli

It is enough to click on my name to write me.
On the top right corner of the main page of the Asiatica Association there
is also our full address, phone (+ 39 02 76011736) and fax (+ 39 02
700511864).

Thank  you for your interest.

best,

eg
