Vishvanath Temple
Thanks to Axel Michaels & Joerg Gengnagel for their input.
However, if you please, one more question concerning the Vishvanath Temple
(main): are there in force any regulations that would disable the members
of any segment of (broadly defined) Hindu population from entering it?
Sikhs? Untouchables? Like, for example, Banarasi Doms?
Regards,
