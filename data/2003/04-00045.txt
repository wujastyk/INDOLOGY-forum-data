Dear members of the list,
Given that the United States right now has a right-wing government, any
intervention in this case should be couched in careful language.
Otherwise, ignorant republican senators and congressmen might draw the
conclusion that you are just a bunch of leftists trying to keep an
honest conservative out of the job.
Best regards,
Lars Martin Fosse
