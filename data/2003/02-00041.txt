Evidently the verse occurs with many variants.  The one I have heard goes like this:

ahalyaa draupadii siitaa taaraa mandodarii tathaa /
pancakam naa smaren nityam mahaapaatakanaazanam //

It is likely that a more archaic pancakam naa got transformed into pancakanyaa in oral transmission.

                                                        Madhav
