Pancakanya
Evidently the verse occurs with many variants.  The one I have heard goes like this:
ahalyaa draupadii siitaa taaraa mandodarii tathaa /
pancakam naa smaren nityam mahaapaatakanaazanam //
It is likely that a more archaic pancakam naa got transformed into pancakanyaa in oral transmission.
