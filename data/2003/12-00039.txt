introduction and a question
Posted by Joanna Kirkpatrick
Perhaps you are thinking of the famous death poems of Zen monks and other
poets in Japan? Like Saigyo's death poem, written perhaps a decade earlier
according to La Fleur, 2003 (his translation):
Let it be in spring
and under the cherry blossoms that
I die, while the moon
is perfect at midmonth, like
it was for his peaceful passing. (refers to the Buddha, of course)

think it is the same one, but of the same genre. Thanks again,
