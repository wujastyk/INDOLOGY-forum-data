This new book on the very much neglected Paippal?da version of the
Atharvaveda has just reached me :
Abhijit Ghosh (ed.)
?tharvan?
A collection of essays on the AtharvaVeda with special reference to its
Paippal?da tradition
Kolkata: Sanskrit Book Depot  (June?) 2002
Rs. 375, $ 25 ;  pp. 198
[Publ.:  Abhoy Barman,  28/1 Bidhan Sarani, Kolkata 700 006]
Contains papers by T.N. Adhikari, S.S. Bahulkar, D. Bhattacharya, V.A. van
Bijlert, S.C. Chakrabarti, A. Ghosh, A. Griffiths, C.G. Kashikar, N. R.
Kulkarni, J.A. Moleanu, K. Mylius, S.P. Narang,  H.C. Patyal, G.U. Thite,

Several of them deal with editing the PS and the multifarious problems
encountered with understanding this difficult, second oldest Indian text.
Recommended as an introduction to current (Paipp.) Athavaveda studies.
Cheers, MW.
