Romila Thapar appointed Kluge Chair in Countries and Cultures              of the South at Library of Congress
Dear Dr.Hock,
I remember our meeting at Vienna in 1990 at the WSC. I am sure that the concerted effort by members
and sympathizers of the Sangh Parivar to get Professor Thapar's Kluge  Chair at the Library of Congress rescinded and to nominate Koenraad  Elst instead, has to be defeated.What  am I to do in this connection? To whom shall I inform the fact that Dr.Romila Thaper is the correct person to hold that post?Let this discussion be forwarded to those concerned.
