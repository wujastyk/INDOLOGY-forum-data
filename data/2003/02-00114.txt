Subject: XML/TEI-Sanskrit texts, anyone?
Message-ID: <161227072410.23782.10316739612186563327.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

The potential of XML/XSLT, in combination with the TEI guidelines, is
really amazing. I'm just starting to look into all these things, and
therefore my question:

Are there already any Indic e-texts available which make use of these
technologies? Or are such projects under way, anywhere?

For those who are interested: I experimented a little with perl and XML. I
used Tilman Vetter's edition of the first chapter of the PramANavinizcaya
by DharmakIrti (Tibetan text) as an example. This has no XSLT background;
just a simple perl script using perl XML modules to translate XML markup
into HTML entities.  I used Andrew Glass' Gandhari Unicode font for the
diacritics:

I would appreciate any information about similar projects.

Best regards,
