I apologise to other MS Windows users who have had this
problem. Windows file names -- unlike UNIX file names -- must be case
insensitive.

I will alter the file names to something approximating the Velthuis
scheme: that is, `A' to `aa', `I' to `ii' and so on. When this is done
I will notify the list.
