Perhaps you should note these, too:

Even if the medical viewpoint is very different from that of poetry,
Meulenbeld is the starting point with plant names.
BTW I. Koponen, our retired professor of botany, once told of New Guinea
(where he did fieldwork) that the amount of exact nomenclature is widely
variating. Of two peoples, living in neighbouring valleys, one was
capable of naming more than 200 different plants, other perhaps 20 or so.
