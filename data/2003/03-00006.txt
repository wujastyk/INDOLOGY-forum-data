Unicode outliner plus [Mac]
Dear All
Let me bring to your attention a super outliner, NoteTaker
(http://www.aquaminds.com/index.jsp), which you may find useful in more
than one way.
        Unicode (UTF-8 & UTF-16): fonts, export
        Optional multi-line entries
        Paste As: plain text, rich text, image, outline
        Web-publishing tool
        Too many features to list here
        For OS X only
Greetings,
Beatrice Reusch
