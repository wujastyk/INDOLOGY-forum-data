New IPSAS Vol.: Epic Grammar by Th. Oberlies
Sorry, I  forgot to put in INDOLOGY's address in this recent message to the
Indology/Indian lists. So, again:
=================================================================
We are please to announce the release of a new volume in the Grundriss
series: INDIAN PHILOLOGY AND SOUTH ASIAN STUDIES, edited by Albrecht
Wezler and Michael Witzel
(http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~witzel/ipsas.htm) :
IPSAS  vol. 5
Thomas Oberlies
A Grammar of Epic Sanskrit
Berlin, New York : de Gruyter 2003
pp.LVI, 632, Euro 148.00
This massive book, dedicated to E.D. Kulkarni and N. Sen, deals with the
typical  features that distinguish the Sanskrit of the Mahabharata and
Ramayana from the classical Sanskrit (of Panini) and establish it as a
distinct form of Sanskrit, just like Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit.
The work is based on the critical edition of both texts, as made available
in electronic form by Muneo Tokunaga (Kyoto Univ.)
It deals with questions of Sandhi, declension (nouns, pronouns, numerals,
ordinals), the verbal system, including the aberrant form of present
classes, and with syntax. There are additional sections on nominal
composition, prepositions and postpositions, and a long section (pp.
383-550) on the roots and verb forms specific to Epic Sanskrit, which is a
welcome addition to Whitney's "Roots" -- by now quite dated.
