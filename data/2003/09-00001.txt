compounds of opposites?
Friends,
Twice in the Divyaavadaana (Cowell and Neil 1886: 254.22, 483.25)
occurs the word v.rddha-yuvatii, glossed by the editors, apparently
only contextually, once as midwife, again as procuress. When we have
a parallel in the Vinayavibhanga of the Muulasarvaastivaada Vinaya in
Tibetan (bud med rgan mo) and Chinese (lao3-mu3) only, both interpret
simply in the sense of old woman.
Does anyone know of any study of such 'compounds of opposites'? (I
imagine if such a study existed it would be written by Gonda, but I
could be wrong.) Can anyone think of a comperable example?
Many thanks!
