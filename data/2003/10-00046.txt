Dear Patrick,

Have you had a look at P-S Filliozat's little "Que sais-je?" volume, also
available in English tr.:

Filliozat, Pierre-Sylvain
Title Details:
The Sanskrit language : an overview : history and structure, linguistic
and philosophical representations, uses and users / Pierre-Sylvain
Filliozat ; translated from the French by T.K. Gopalan
Publisher:
Varanasi : Indica Books, 2000
Physical desc.:
135 p ; 23 cm
ISBN/ISSN:
8186569170

It has quite a lot on Panini, what it means to be a Pandit, and so on.
It's not an introduction to the sastra as such, but a very good overview
of the social and intellectual background of Sanskrit.
