SV: Romila Thapar appointed Kluge Chair in Countries and              Cultures of the South at Library of Congress
Please tell me the academic value or contribution to intellectual
freedom offered by the following:
Given that the United States right now has a right-wing government, any
intervention in this case should be couched in careful language.
Otherwise, ignorant republican senators and congressmen might draw the
conclusion that you are just a bunch of leftists trying to keep an
honest conservative out of the job.
My fear is that this *type* thing will quickly degenerate into the
polemics that drove Indology out of business once (? at least once)
before.
I suggest that any further exchanges on this issue should be carried
on off-list.
