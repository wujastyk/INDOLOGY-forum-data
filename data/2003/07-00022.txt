During my visit to Pune during May 2002, I came to understand that a contract to digitize the slips was already awarded to a computer firm in Pune.  I distinctly remember meeting the director of this firm at the Bhandarkar Institute.  I don't know whether the work of digitization ever actually began and where it stands today.  

                                                                        Madhav Deshpande
