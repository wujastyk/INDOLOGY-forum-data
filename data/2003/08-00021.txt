Dear Patrick,
Oskar von Hin?ber (Der Beginn der Schrift und
fr?he Schriftlichkeit in Indien, Wiesbaden &
Stuttgart: Franz Steiner, 1989: 34) and Harry
Falk (Schrift im alten Indien: ein
Forschungsbericht mit Anmerkungen, T?bingen:
Gunter Narr Verlag, 1992: 304) have both used the
archeological evidence of certain types of coins
as a means to date Paa.nini (who in
A.s.taadhyaayii 5.2.120 refers to a specific use
of the term ruupya) at ca. 350 B.C.E. (O.v.H.) or
between 350 and 300 B.C.E. (H.F.). On this
argument to date Paa.nini and its common neglect
cf. Bronkhorst Asiatische Studien / Etudes
Asiatiques 46 (1992): 723f and my Three Myths in
Modern Paa.ninian Studies in Asiatische Studien /
Etudes Asiatiques 57 (2003): 162.
On your more general question on gold coins you
might consult Ellen Raven's Gupta Gold Coins
(Gonda Indological Studies, Groningen 1994) or
consult her directly at Leiden University.
The publications of Raven, von Hin?ber and Falk
contain several further references relevant to
your query.
Best regards,
Jan
