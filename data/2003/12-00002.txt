Sorry to Stefan:  I list Jacob's books here:


Author   Jacob, George Adolphus.     Title  A handful of popular
maxims current in Sanskrit literature / collected by G. A. Jacob. ...
Edition  2d ed. rev. and enl.     Publisher  Bombay : Tuk?r?m J?vaj?,
1907-1911.     Description  3 v. 21 cm.     Note  Title in Sanskrit
at head of t.p.; text in English and Sanskrit.     Note  Includes
bibliographical references and index.     Contents  [pt. 1]. A
handful of popular maxims current in Sanskrit literature.-- [pt. 2].
A second handful of popular maxims current in Sanskrit literature.
1909.-- [pt. 3]. A third handful of popular maxims current in
Sanskrit literature. 1911.

The title of vol. 2, which for some reason is the only one I ever
input into my own list of cited works, has the Skt title:
laukikanyaayaanjali.h dvitiiyo bhaaga.h , then as in English: mine is
the third edition, 1925, published by Nirnaya Sagar Press.

Apparently there is a recent reprint of all three vols in 1:  Delhi :
N??r??jan??, 1983. And as I wrote earlier, I cannot put my hands on
my own copies now...
