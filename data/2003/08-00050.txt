couldyouhelp?
Dear Colleagues,
I would be grateful if someone could help me with the following information:
1)      I understand that Vishnu Dharmottara, a 5th century Purana (?), is
in three parts.  Is there a &#8220;standard&#8221; edition of these volumes?  I have
come across English translations of either parts of or only the last part
(Chitrasutra) of the Purana?  I would be keen to know whether the entire
text is available in translation.
2)      Is there any extended critical work (apart from Stella Kramrisch&#8217;s
introduction) on the Chitrasutra in English?
3)      Could some one suggest me what kind of readings are available on the
Sutra genre?  Is Louis Renou&#8217;s &#8220;Sur le genre du sutra dan la literature
Sanskrite&#8221; available in English translation?
Let me acknowledge my gratitude to you in advance for your help.
