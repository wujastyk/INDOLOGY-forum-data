facsimile editions
Hi Leslie and Indology members,
I have (and have had for some time) something quite different and wonder
whether you or anyone on the list has any suggestions: a set of excellent
bl/wh photographs of Tantric mudras used in Kerala with explanations. About
20 I believe. Where to publish it Indological publications being so
verbally oriented?
Happy New year,
