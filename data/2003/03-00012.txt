Summary: XML/TEI-Sanskrit texts, anyone?
Dear all,
here is a summary of all the information I received to my query about 
XML/TEI-based Sanskrit texts. Many thanks to everyone who answered!
Best regards,
Birgit Kellner
I) Software information
TBook, see http://tbookdtd.sourceforge.net/
TBook can generate high quality LaTeX, HTML, XHTML, and DocBook output
from a single UTF8 XML source file. It does not use TEI guidelines. 
(Information from Richard Mahoney)
II) Technical documentation and useful literature
1) Tibetan and Himalayan Digital Library. The technologies used at the THDL 
are documented here: 
http://iris.lib.virginia.edu/tibet/tools/technologies.html
The ?Introduction to SGML/XML? which is offered there is very useful, 
though it seems to consist only of the first part of a planned more 
extensive documentation.
2) E-Textnology and Vedic Research, by John Robert Gardner:

III) Actual texts encoded in TEI/XML
1) Bhatta Narayanas Venisamhara (Yves Codet): 
http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgadkw/xml/venisamhara/venisamhara.xml
2) Peter M. Scharf and Malcolm D. Hyman are converting the text of the 
Sanskrit Library (http://sanskritlibrary.org/) into XML, including 
Ramopakhyana, Visnupurana Amsa 4, Purnabhadra's Pancatantra, Panini's 
Astadhyayi, Nirukta, etc. Whitney?s ?Roots? will also be made available 
soon.
IV) Further information
Veeranarayan Pandurangi informs about a friend of his in Tirupati called 
Srinivasa Varakhedi who worked with TEI and might be contacted at 
srivara at india.com.
