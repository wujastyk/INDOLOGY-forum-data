animals
I should have begun this by saying i was focused on bird an dplant/flower
names in Meghaduta--to save learned listmembers the trouble of sending me so
many referecnes, but still grateful for all tiose too and they are being
added to my list. I should be able to get a copy of Dave on ILL. The medical
treatises, I'd suspect, treat of birds plants etc in reference to dieases
and treatments, and so they might not be that helpful for elucidating
literary references?
