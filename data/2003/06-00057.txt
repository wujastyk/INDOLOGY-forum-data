moon water?
Dear Dominik
Could this be a reference to the reflection of the moon on water and the
momentary appearance of bubbles on the surface of water? I admit that this
would probably be `vidhu-budbuda-jala'

moon water?
I've got the expression "vidhu-jala-budbuda" in a dvandva compound which
is a list of things which are meant to happen for no reason, all by
themselves (akasmaad bhavanti).
"The bubbling of moon water"?  Any suggestions about what vidhu-jala might
be?
Best,
Dominik
