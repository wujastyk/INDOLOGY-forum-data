Dear List,

Can anybody enlighten me on the earliest occurrence of the compound maayaajaala, a Buddhist term, I assume.  It occurs in Ga.nezapuraa.na 2, 59, 27 to describe Ga.neza's capacity to be a maayaavin.  I could not find the compound in Monier Williams, Edgerton or the PTS dictionary.

Thanks,

Greg
