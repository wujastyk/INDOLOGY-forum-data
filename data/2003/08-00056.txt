Dear members of the list,

I wonder if some kind soul could help me get hold of the following paper
by Hock:

Hock, H. H. 1985. Reduced-clause and clause-union absolutives and
participles in Vedic Prose. VIIth South Asian Languages Analysis
Roundtable. Ann Arbor, Michigan

It is not at the university library in Oslo (as far as I have been able
to ascertain), therefore this imposition on your patience.

Best regards,

Lars Martin Fosse
