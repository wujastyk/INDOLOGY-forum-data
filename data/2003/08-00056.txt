Paper by H. H. Hock
Dear members of the list,
I wonder if some kind soul could help me get hold of the following paper
by Hock:
Hock, H. H. 1985. Reduced-clause and clause-union absolutives and
participles in Vedic Prose. VIIth South Asian Languages Analysis
Roundtable. Ann Arbor, Michigan
It is not at the university library in Oslo (as far as I have been able
to ascertain), therefore this imposition on your patience.
Best regards,
Lars Martin Fosse
