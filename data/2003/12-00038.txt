introduction and a question
Re the Zen reference, Yes, I think I was confabulating Chinese and Indian texts, perhaps because the liminal feeling is similar.  My interest is in this very special moment on the verge, which seems to open the possibility of an enlightenment that endures in life, which of course is fundamental in Zen.  I think this is imagined in the Vrindavan world, and what Sri Atmananda (Krsna Menon) called "the world between the guru and disciple," (his Malayalam Radhamadhavam): a third realm distinct from ordinary life and moksa.  I talked about this at Madison this year in connection to psychoanalysis, but left out the poem I am now searching for, obviously!  My main text was the Samkhya Karika where prakrti says to purusa "nasmi naham na me."  More on this at my website braindance.us, see the East-West Psychology page.
