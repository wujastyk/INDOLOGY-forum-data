Thanks & Hindu marriage mantras, please?
Does anyone recall seeing a varttika "hastAn nirasane"? In the
"RAkAgama, GAgAbhaTTa cites such a varttika as justification of Nic
in the verbal form hastayate, but I have not succeeded in finding
this in the c denominatives chpater of the "SiddhAnta KaumudI."
