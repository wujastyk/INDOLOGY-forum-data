Svastika: history and interpretation
Dear Christian,
        I send you the references to svastika I ran across in
Patanjali's Mahabhasya and Sabara's (Mimamsa) Bhasya citing my book
The Denotation of Generic Terms.  I will also add the anectode that
in the front sitting room of the house of a certain Brahmana family
in Mysore is prominently displayed a monument.  Atop three foot
square base is a globe on top of which an eagle is perched with
spread wings.  On the front of the globe is a svastika.  The monument
is clearly a production of Nazi German origins.  The svastika in
early India is not associated with birds of prey perching on globes.

[Patanjali]
"He gives the following two ordinary examples in which a substance
(dravya) is permanent and its shapes (?k?ti) are transient:
Clay connected with a certain shape is a ball.  Crushing the
ball-shape small pots are made.  Crushing the small-pot-shape cups
are made.  Similarly, gold connected with a certain shape is a ball.
Crushing the ball-shape necklaces are made.  Crushing the
necklace-shape bracelets are made.  Crushing the bracelet-shape
auspicious symbols (svastika) are made.  Again it returns to a gold
ball.  Again connected with another shape it becomes two golden
earrings the color of khadira embers.  Each shape is different but
the substance is the same.  By crushing the shape, only the substance
remains. 21

  MB-K, vol. 1, p. 7, lines 11-18.  Ch?ndogyopani?ad 6.1.4-6 has a
comparable passage.  Ten Principal Upanishads, p. 505.  See Biardeau
1964: 45 note 1 for references.
p. 211  Mimamsabhasya
Saying that the class property is directly perceptible, the V?ttik?ra
gives the example of three golden ornaments.  One directly perceives
that a golden necklace is a necklace, a golden svastika a svastika
and a golden cup a cup (1.1.5 ?2).
p. 270
Nanv ?k?ti? s?dhy?sti v?, na v??
(Objector:)  Is the class property something to be inferred, or not?
Na pratyak?? sat? s?dhy? bhavitum arhati.  Rucaka? svastiko
vardham?naka iti hi pratyak?a? d??yate.
(Proponent:)  Being directly perceptible it cannot be something to be
inferred.  We directly perceive a necklace, an auspicious symbol and
a cup. 5
note 5
A vardham?naka is a certain type of pot for drinking.  The Amarako?a,
2.9.32a (p. 313a) says, "Gha?a? ku?anip?v astr? ?ar?vo
vardham?naka?," on which the R?m??ram? says, "...dve p?trabhedasya."
Vaidyan?tha ??str? comments:
sauvar?apad?rthagatarucakatv?dirp?v?ntara-s?m?ny?bhipr?ye?a bodhyam.
Tray?nugatasuvar?atvarpas?m?ny?bhipr?ya? vedam.  He intends the
specific properties of being a necklace, etc. in golden entities.  He
also intends the general property goldenness present in all three.
MD, part 1, p. 61.  That is, the different names denote the narrower
class property as opposed to the one that the three objects have in
common.  Yudhi??hira M?m??saka (1977-86, vol. 1, p. 39) uses the
Sanskrit words minus their terminations for the three examples in
Hindi but adds, "?bh?a?avi?e?aa(specific ornaments)."
Ga?g?n?tha Jh? (1933: vol. 1, p. 21) translates the examples, "the
necklace, the road-crossing, the dish, and so forth," as if they are
totally unrelated things.  Taking them as golden ornaments, as
Vaidyan?tha and Yuddhi??hira M?m??saka do, brings out the relevance
of the objectors argument.
