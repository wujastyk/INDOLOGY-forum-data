Rgveda from Magadha?
Deshpande says:
-".ZAkalya was only one of the editors of the Rgveda, and that his recension
represents only one of several. We know that ZAkalya based his recension in
part on the earlier recension of MANDUkeya which was prevalent in the
northeastern region of Magadha, while the original Rgvedic hymns were
composed in the northwestern region."

Why is it thought that there is a Magadha source for ZAkalya?
