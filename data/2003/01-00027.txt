Dear Dominik,

The information on the series at the .../southasia/cuvl/indolseries.html
URL is still correct except that the prices for the microfilm copies has
increased over the past decade.  Inquiries about purchase of the microfilm,
including current prices, may still be addressed to the relevant institutions.

All microfilmed titles in the major series and almost all of those for the
less well known series have been fully cataloged.  Complete sets of the
bibliographic information for the microfilm copies are available on the
OCLC and on the RLIN databases.  The vast majority of those cataloging
records have been available since the early 1990s.  The last of the
cataloging has continued at a slow rate, but should be completed this year.

Funds have not been available for a printing subvention, so the full
Indological Books in Series has not appeared as an ink print.  Funds for
the Digital South Asia Library (DSAL) project from the U.S. Department of
Education are to support development of resources for modern languages and
other recent resources of information the study of South Asia.  The study
of classical languages is generally not support by that funding agency.  We
have been careful to find complementary sources of funding when resources
relating to classical topics are made available under DSAL.  It still is my
intention that the Indological series database should be presented as a Web
resource.  It would be imprudent, though, to predict when that might happen
since the lack of support and the pressure of other obligations make it
difficult to speak with assurance.

Best wishes,
