lecture by Professor Wendy Doniger, University of Chicago:
'Indian Variants of the Myth of the Woman Who Pretended To Be Herself'
14th November 2003, 16:00?17:30
Rm B102, Brunei Gallery, SOAS
Thornhaugh Street, Russell Square
London WC1H 0XG
Many cultures tell stories about people who, through a kind of triple cross,
pretend to be someone else pretending to be them, thus in effect
masquerading as themselves, pretending to be precisely what they are. This
theme appears in India in two plays by Harsha, in Bhavabhuti's retelling of
the Ramayana, and in the Hindi film Satyam Shivam Sundaram. Together these
texts suggest that many people must put on masks to discover who they really
are under the masks they really wear; and that, although such masquerades
cannot change them into someone else, they may change them into others among
their many selves.
All are welcome!
