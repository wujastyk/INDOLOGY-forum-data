I recently read Pierre Briant's "From Cyrus to Alexander : a history of
the Persian Empire," and he on several occasions says he thinks the
issues of coins by Darius and his successors were intermittent and
solely for the sake of paying Greek mercenaries.  Whether the latter
were active in India and the adjacent regions I would have no idea.
