12th WSC - Web-site updated
Dear Petteri Koskikallio,
 Just to let you know that I am still waiting for my conference funding.
That's why I haven't paid registration fee nor hotel reservation as yet.
Hope the Chair coughs up some money in the next short while. I'll get back
to  you.
Say hello to Asko.
Best
