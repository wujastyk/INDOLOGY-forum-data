Subject: jaya = 108?

Rather, in kaTapayaadi, ka, Ta, pa ya all stand for "1", kha, pha, etc. for 
"2" etc.  After the nasals come ca, ta, Sa for "6" and this takes one to 
ja, da, ha for "8".

Zero, of course, cannot be ignored. The expressions are decimal, with the 
units placed on the left. This implies that "jaya" stands for "81" since we 
write our units on the right. It does not support Frederic's theory.
