pancakanya
Nearly after 40 years later I hear the pancakanya sloka.  My mother used to
recite this before going to bed along with another (now I realize ) Sanskrit
sloka to ward off snakes, scorpions and other harmful creatures.  The verse,
from memory run like this:
Karakotakasya naagasya ...damayanti cha rutuparanasya
rajarshi teerthanam kalinashanam
and then
Ahaylay draupadi kunti taara mandodari
tatha pancakanya smare nityam mahapataknashanam
These were recited five times before going to bed.
I now realize that they have puranic sources.
