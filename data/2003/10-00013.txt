Subject: help with identifying a metre
Message-ID: <161227073293.23782.7835497360841500811.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Friends,

there is a passage in the Divyaavadaana Cowell & Neil 407.20-23 (in
the story of Ku.naala) printed by the editors as prose, but
consistently taken by interpreters, including the re-editor
Mukhopadyaya, as verse. The text:

mama bhavatu mara.na.m maatu sthitasya dharme vizuddhabhaavasya /
na tu jiivitena kaarya.m sajjanadhikk.rtena mama //
svargasya dharmalopo yato bhavati jiivitena ki.m tena /
mama mara.nahetunaa vai budhaparibhuutena dhikk.rtena //

Despite my efforts (feeble as they may be), if this is indeed in
verse, I cannot identify the metre. Any suggestions?
