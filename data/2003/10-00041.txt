Dear Colleagues (with apologies for cross-posting):

For a graduate level seminar I am teaching in the Spring, I am
seeking brief [before 100 pages] studies of some of the sastras;
especially, Ayurveda, Jyotihsastra, Mathematics, Alamkara, and Natya.
For Ayurveda, I will of course, use Dominik's work; but something
that can supplement it. What is also the best intro to Vyakarana for
those who have not yet read Panini.

Thanks.

Patrick Olivelle
