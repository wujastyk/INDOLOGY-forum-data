Bha.t.ta Bhaaskara Mi;sra's Bhaa.sya on the Taittiriiya              Braahma.na
Arlo,
Given my resources here, I cannot help you with your main query, but perhaps
my attempt at a different translation will serve to guide your query
properly.
The common word is va;sa.mvada 'under control, in possession, existing under
the direction of,' not va.m;savada (in fact, I cannot recall coming across
the latter anywhere). Misplacement of the anusvaara is not uncommon in
Naagarii printing.
The first passage you cite is:
To me, its natural meaning would be: 'It was difficult/impossible to obtain
Bha.t.ta Bhaaskara's commentary on the four last anuvaakas of the second
a.s.taka of the Taittiriiyabraahma.na which is/was, under the control of a
certain pandit living on the bank of the Godaavarii.'
Such statements about not getting access to a precious or particularly
valuable ms are (unfortunately) found in the introductions of the editions
of several Indic texts.
More importantly, my translation, implying that at a certain time the latter
part of B-B's work was at least thought to exist, would make the use of
ko;saantaraabhavaat 'because other mss did not exist (because I/we did not
have access to other mss)' and lupta.m du.spaa.tham ca 'lost and having
bad/corrupt readings' in your third passage understandable (I am assuming
that nothing else of relevance has been written between the passages; I do
not have the original in front of me).
