jaya = 108?
Just received my own E-mail. I apologize for introducing more confusion by 
typing "81" for "18"...
Please read my last two sentences as follows:
The expressions are decimal, with the units placed on the left. This 
implies that "jaya" stands for "18" since we write our units on the right. 
It does not support Frederic's theory.
