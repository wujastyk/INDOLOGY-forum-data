Buddhist Relics from Bhilsa Topes
The reliquaries, artefacts etc are indeed in the British Museum.  But
the bodily relics (of the two chief Arahats, SAriputta and
MoggallAna) were given into the keeping of the Bhikkhu-saGgha in Sri
Lanka.
This is from memory, so I can't at present provide a reference.
