Dear Colleague,
The private address of our Emeritus Univ.-Prof. Dr. Gerhard Oberhammer is:
Magtstrasse 2
A-6020 Innsbruck
Austria.
There he will be for most of his time. But as he continues to teach also at
our institute (being the successor of the Institut f?r Indologie of which he
was the head), You may sometimes also reach him there:
Institut f?r S?dasien-, Tibet- und Buddhismuskunde
Bereich: S?dasienkunde
Universit?t - Campus, Hof 4/2.1
A-1080 Vienna
Austria.
With best wishes
Chlodwig H. Werba.
