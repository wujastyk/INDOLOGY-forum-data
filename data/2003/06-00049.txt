I have a copy of the ISCII 1991 document with appendices but I'm
afraid my copy of appendix G is missing page 22, the first of 4 pages
comprising it.
Perhaps you can obtain a copy of the whole document, the appendix, or
at least the first page of it, by writing to the publishers of the
document:

Bureau of Indian Standards
Manak Bhavan
9 Bahadur Shah Zafar marg
New Delhi 110 002
INDIA

If you do get it, please send me the first page of appendix G (page 22).
