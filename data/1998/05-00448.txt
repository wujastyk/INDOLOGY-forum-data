 valastRSNe" (valast.r.s.ne) is a misprint for valattRSNe, Miller's actual (intended) reading. I have it so marked on my copy of the edn. 'K.r.s.na, whose desire is turning toward young women -- who is getting interested in (other) women' is the contextually intended meaning. 
As I recall, Jaya-deva uses the root val in some other verses too, sometimes in keeping with the saying current among pa.n.ditas "kali-valii kaama-dhenuu": 'one can invest the roots kal and val with any meaning that the context requires. They are the wish-fulfilling cows (for authors/poets)'
