I remember reading Schaffer's presentation in the Michigan conference in
October 1997, (about the untenable archaeological or linguistic bases for the
Aryan migration theories and about indigenous discontinuities and internal
migrations evidenced by hundreds of IVC sites)where he (together with his
co-author) states (to the effect) that Renfrew even falsified archaeological
evidence to explain his agricultural expansion route theories. Maybe, someone
has ready access to the paper to cite more precisely.
