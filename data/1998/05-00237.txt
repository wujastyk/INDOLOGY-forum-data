With all this discussion on horses in India, what are the origins
for the words for horse in Sanskrit.

Ghota seems somewhat similar to Yenesei-Ostyak "kuta" and even
Austronesian "kud(j)a".

Haya has been connected with the English word "horse."  I believe
there is an Indic "hyivor" that compares with an Old Germanic
"hyros" or something like that.

Does anyone accept asva > equus?

According to Indian tradition, the domesticated horse originated in
the east during the Churning of the Milky Ocean. The Asura Bali was
said to first have possession of this horse, and legend ascribes
domestication of horses to the Asuras.

Tamed horses were fed rice donated to their sage trainers, and thus
horses are also called salihotra.
