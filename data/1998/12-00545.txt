SV: creation of human kind
I would think that the karma theory
emanates from Jainism and gets absorbed into
other lines of faith.  Jainism bases its
doctrines on the creation and annihiliation
of Karma.  Doesn't need a God to monitor it though..
Creates a scale for karma and you may measure.
Just be good and all sins are gone (in time).
