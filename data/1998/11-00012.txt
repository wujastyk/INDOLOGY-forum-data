I think that I missed that or forgotten about it. Please let me know
if you have saved the letter.

Right now you can use Omkar ITRANSlator 1.2 beta to convert
english + sanskrit file to html format and send it. For Sans12.ttf
part of my posting I used the file generated by ITRANSlator. To that
I added the xdvng.ttf part with the help of a "HTMLed" editor.
But you can also use Sri Avinash Chopde's "webitrans.zip" pakage
to produce the .html file. That also can be sent as an attachment
in e-mail with the option "Put text attachments in the body of the
message" and it will be displayed as a normal letter with out any
necessity of clicking the .html file.

regards,

sarma.
