Caldwell,              Dravidian Linguistics (Was: : Tamil words in English)
Francis Whyte Ellis, a British administrator, is a very interesting
figure. He is the original founder of the idea of Dravidian language
family. This is given in Encyclopaedia Brittanica.
He appointed A. Muttusami Pillai of Pondichery as a Munshi (language-pundit)
to teach Tamil in the College of Fort St. George, Madras. It was at
the instigation of F. W. Ellis that Muttusami Pillai began collecting
Tamil manuscripts.
In point of fact, it was most probably Muttusami Pillai who was the
*first* scholar to make an extensive tour of Tamil Nadu, in 1816,
with the explicit purpose to search for, collect and classify Tamil
palmleaf manuscripts in particular the works of Beschi (1680-1747),
a Jesuit missionary, who tamilized his name as Veeramaamunivar.
Ellis visited the palace of the Sethupatis of Ramnad, because
he can get in touch with erudite scholars. The fate of the
Ellis collection of South Indian manuscripts, mainly with the
help of A. Muttusami Pillai, was unfortunate.
The successor to Ellis in Madras was not interested in S. Indian languages.
His name is Peter, I recollect. Collector Peter's
butler used Ellis' 2 or 3 rooms-full manuscripts to
kindle the oven fires, for the Collectors' evening parties.
It seems this information is given in an obituary to
an English scholar of Tamil that appeared in Sunday Times, London.
F. W. Ellis' life, his manuscripts, their fate etc., is well worth
investigating. Or, is it already done? I read about the manuscripts and
their burning about 15 years ago in
K. Meenakshisundaram, The contribution of European scholars
to Tamil, Univ. of Madras, 1974, 370 p.
Ellis published his translation of 13 short chapters of Tirukkural
