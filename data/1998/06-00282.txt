Draft transliteration scheme on the Web
Thanks for choosing l_macron-b for
the special "l" found only in Tamil and Malayalam.
As for Tamil literature, in all the US university press
publications and especially those of K. Zvelebil starting from his
Smile of Murugan to the recent "Lexicon of Tamil
literature" (E. J. Brill), l_mac-b is consistently
used following Madras univ. Tamil lexicon.
Regards,
N. Ganesan
