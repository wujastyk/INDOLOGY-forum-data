What Dezinaamamaala 6.117 with commentary actually has is: ma.m.dillo
apuupa.h/  (For this Pischel/Ramanujaswami have in the glossary is "a small
round cake [f(rom) ma.m.dila]" No justification is given for this
understanding. But in any case, while I suspect this is related, it is not
the same form.)

These still do not solve my essential problem. MW cites exactly the passage
I am trying to illucidate, so he definition is useless to me. I have
assumed that ma.n.diilaka is indeed some sort of diminutive, and that it is
probably some sort of round cake, but what I would really like to find is
whether the word appears anywhere else at all.  No help in that department?
