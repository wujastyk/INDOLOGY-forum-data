Om <--> Amen
On Om, see inter alia my 'Om: the sacred syllable in the Veda' in _A
net cast wide: Investigations into Indian Thought in Memory of David
Friedman_, ed. J. J,. Lipner (Newcastle upon Tyne, Grevatt & Grevatt,
1986, ISBN 0 9507918 8 1). There's no etymological connection with
Amen, but their analogous ritual use gives them some analogous
semantic content.
