Hindi-Urdu echo-nouns in v
Dear members of the list,
I would be grateful for references to descriptions of doubled nouns in
Hindi-Urdu of the following type:
First noun: is an ordinary noun
Second noun: is a nonsense word that begins with v (or m) and rhymes with
the first noun
Examples:
caae vaae, 'tea, etc.'
saRak maRak, 'roads and highways, etc.'
languages, but it has not reached us yet.
My apologies for cross-postings.
With best wishes,
Ruth Schmidt
