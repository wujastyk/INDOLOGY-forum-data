Dear members of the list,

I would be grateful for references to descriptions of doubled nouns in
Hindi-Urdu of the following type:

First noun: is an ordinary noun
Second noun: is a nonsense word that begins with v (or m) and rhymes with
the first noun

Examples:
caae vaae, 'tea, etc.'
saRak maRak, 'roads and highways, etc.'

--If anyone would care to send further examples I would be very happy.

--I am aware of Anvita Abbi's work on reduplicated words in South Asian
languages, but it has not reached us yet.

My apologies for cross-postings.

With best wishes,

Ruth Schmidt
