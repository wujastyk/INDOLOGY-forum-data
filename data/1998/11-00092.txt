Paired Horse and PIE breakup

I bet all or almost all Altaic languages have some word
like "radyo", "radiyo", "radio", "aradiyo" or something
like it for radio, but it hardly means that they invented
it or that they did not borrow the word.
Words like this are tricky. Look at the word "cek" (where
c is the voiced fricative i..e dg) in Karachay-Balkar.
It means to 'hitch' an animal, or to get something or
someone to pull something and sounds remarkably like
'yoke'. Furthermore, it is very close to /chek/ which
in Turkish means "to pull". Does this mean that it is
impossible that /cek/ came from IE for 'yoke' or that
/chek/ meaning 'to pull' came from /cek/? No.
The word for the ox-collar (or even the yoke) for
animals is 'boyunduruk' clearly from 'boyun' meaning
neck. Does this mean that they invented the yoke and
did not borrow it? No.
Things like this can't be done in isolation. Other languages
have to be also involved in conclusions of this type.
Furthermore, the first time something is noted in writing
does not mean that the word belongs to that language.
It can be researched as much as possible. The conclusions
do not follow without uncertainty from the evidence.
The simplest and most widely accepted
It would be very helpful to know what these words are supposed
to be derived from. After all, it is hard to know if the words
that these cart-chariot words are supposed to be derived from
are not really words derived from the words referring to cart-chariot.
For example, one cannot be sure that some word meaning 'nail'
is derived from a similar word meaning 'penis' assuming that
the word for body parts came first. it could be other way around
because the word for penis might have been named in slang after
'nail'.
I have a paper on things like this in .doc format which I would
email to people who want to read it as an example to what I am
talking about.
Best Regards,
Mark
