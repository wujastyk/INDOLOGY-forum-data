Yes, Etruscan <tur-> is "to give".  There is possibly a connection
with Pre-Greek <turannos> "king, tyrant", which would fit the Minoan
"palace economy" rather well (the king being the one who gives, or
rather, redistributes).  Whether that makes Venus/Turan the
"Dispenseress" or "Tyrant Love", I don't know.
