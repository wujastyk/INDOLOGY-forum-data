Indo-Aryan invasion
        There are many ways for an "invasion" and History gives us many
various examples of moving populations, peaceful or violent. About the
linguistical problem there is an useful question: who comes? just few
warriors (eventually first used as mercenaries)? or whole families?
        In the first case, they find wifes in situ and the babies, breeded
by the women, learn the mother language. A good example is the coming of
Norsemen in the part of France still called Normandie: in very few
generations they completely loose Norse and all speak French.
        But, in the other case, even in a "culturally superior
environment", the political power is able to give a preference to the
newcomers language: an example is found in France where the Gallic is fully
replaced by the Latin. And the religion can be an other powerful vector: in
the Mediterranean aera, the islamization gives the way to the arabization.
        On an other way, we must remember that, even scientifically
conducted, archeology is just able to show us what remains: very few!
stones don't talk! Worse, archeological facts are rarely pure facts but
interpretations via a reading grid based on an unconscient theory. Despite
the Dr Subrahmania point of view, that's not sure that archeology is more
"scientific" than linguistic!
        In my opinion, it's highly probable that Aryans were coming IN,
even if we don't know today how, when and why. Other points of view are
nothing but nationalist ones, respectable only in a political scope.
