Subject: Change in LC email addresses
Message-ID: <161227035115.23782.13918028881514633419.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

The Library of Congress has permanently disabled SoftSwitch, the system
that connected the obsolescent older email system (CA-eMail) to outside
addresses, including both individuals and lists.  This means that addresses
of the form:

<lastname at mail.loc.gov> or <initiallastname at mail.loc.gov>

are no longer valid.  Instead valid addresses will usually look something like

<athr at loc.gov> or <athr at rs8.loc.gov>, the "mail" part of the address being
gone.  The first element will usually be a four-letter abbreviation based on
the first and last name of the person.

People sending personal messages to addresses of the older type, or
administering lists to which the LC person signed on via CA-eMail and
SoftSwitch, can expect to receive messages bounced back.

As chair of the automation team in the Asian Division I have asked all AD
staff to notify correspondents and change list subscriptions.

If you are still using an older address, I would be grateful if you contacted
your LC contacts directly by phone rather than asking me what their new
address is.  Having made several new hires and a number of people having
had their email address changed recently, we are composing a new
directory of Asian Division people including email addresses and I plan to
post it on this list soon. Please contact me only as a last resort, and of
course privately not on the list.  Some people's email addresses can be
found in the LC Employee Directory on the Web at:
