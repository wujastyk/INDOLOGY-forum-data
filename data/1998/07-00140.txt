        I don't believe. Why not a 'caseless' case? I assume the
gratification is the main point, strengthening the dependance relation
between the king and the prince (there is an important difference between
King Arthur who make gifts and later historical kings who prefer to levy
taxes). Hence, I understand the thing given as semantically IN the verbal
group. But I'm not an expert in grammar and my reading of Haudry's
'L'emploi des cas en vedique' is far...
        En tout cas, merci pour votre reponse precise,
