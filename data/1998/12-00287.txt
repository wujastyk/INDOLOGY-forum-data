  For 2000 or more years old funerary practices, some thing
  is told in:
  George Hart, The poems of ancient Tamil, their milieu
  and their sanskrit counterparts, 1975, U.of California press.
  (ISBN: 0520026721)

  George's translation of the whole puRanAnURu is in print
  from Columbia univ. press (1999).

  Very interesting. Sangam texts, especially puRanAnURu
  describe burying in large vases. Big vases (like the Greek
  vases) have been unearthed in AdicchanallUr near
  Tirunelvely. They are of the same period as Tamil classical
  sangam texts.
