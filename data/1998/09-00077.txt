the IV Script...From what I have seen of Mahadevan's review, there
seemed to be no such "breakthrough"...in fact Mahadevan points out
basic fallacies like confusion between sound-values because of
orthographical resemblence ( i.e. what I mean is that the symbol "S"
would suggest "s" to somebody who knows only the Roman script, the
letter "ka" to somebody who knows only the Telugu script("S" with a hat
on the top is the Telugu symbol for "ka") and a "sandhi" for somebody
who knows only the "nAgri" script( i.e: ka:+ ayam = koSyam)
..apparently Jha as well as Kak believe that if a symbol bares any
resemblance to a Devanagri symbol, then their pronounciation is the
same.....

5. He mentions Shriram Sathe's finding that the Christians wanting to
get rid of Judaic ancestry or whatever...That argument takes the cake as
well as the icing... I know that in the 18th century there were works
which portrayed Islam as being a "better" religion than Christianity
(Voltaire, if I remember correctly, authored one of these works)but at
no stage was there any attempt to rid Christianity of Judaic roots....

6. Rajaram takes a swipe at Christian mythology which says that the
world came into being at 9:00 in the morning and notes that the time
zone remains unspecified( giggle, giggle)....What he does not seem to
know is that the same Shriram Sathe says that Rama brought back Sita
to Ayodhya from Lanka in the year 7747 BC( or sometime around that)..
He does not give us the time and does not specify whether Rama was using
Srilankan standard time or Indian standard time or Bangladeshi standard
time....more importantly since Rajaram believes that there is no
difference between  mythology and history, he should know that Lava and
Kusa are still unborn and Rama still has to perform the azvamedhayagna
since he is supposed to have lived for 10,000 years
(he brought back sita 7500+ years ago according to Sathe, so atleast
2,400 years of Rama's reign still remain....).

As always, I welcome comments, corrections and answers...

Regards,
Krishna
