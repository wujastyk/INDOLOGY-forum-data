Tampering with history
In defence of Kulke-Rothermund, it should perhaps be mentioned that the book
originally was written in German. Perversely or not, the Germans insist upon
calling the Indo-Europeans "Indo-Germanen". I therefore suspect that
"Indo-Germans" is translation error.
Why not six million BC? It is really eternal, remember?
