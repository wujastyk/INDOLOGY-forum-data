I presume this is a theory rather
than an established fact.  There
is almost nothing in common between
the "personalities" of these two deities,
Siva and Avalokiteshvara.  In fact, they
are almost exact opposites.
Siva is often wrathful, Avalokiteshvara never so;
one is a hunter, the other saves animals; one
is sometimes cruel, the other is always
compassionate; one is hot-tempered, the
other patient; one is associated with destruction,
the other with protection; etc. etc. etc.  Further,
Avalokiteshvara is definitely the sidekick or
subsidiary  of a big shot, i.e., the Buddha Amitabha,
whereas Siva stands alone.
Just a few differences...

Raja.
