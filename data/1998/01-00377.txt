The Dog
N GANESAN Wrote..
Dog has always been a symbol of intinctual behavior.
According to my findings (not published yet), viSNu can be defined as "First
perception of the Unknown", and rudrA as "Last perception of the Known".
viSNu removes ignorance by providing new knowledge not known hitherto, whereas
rudrA removes the existing ignorance by melting the instincts which are
themselves a symbol of knowledge that was once known but now forgotten.
Thanks to Ganesan for the saivite evidence.
