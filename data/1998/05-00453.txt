Sarasvati (texts & arch.)
Excellent point.  Also, even the latter  date of 1,700BCE is before the
supposed arrival of Indo-Europeans.  Using this chronology, it hardly
seems that they would have described the Sarasvati as a raging river
from the mountains to the sea.
Personally, I don't believe IVC was IE, but at the same time, the
facts don't match the chronology of invasion/migration.
