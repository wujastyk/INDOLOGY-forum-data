I'm not entirely clear what you would require that isn't already available
in the CDAC products: a good Nagari typeface with very acceptable
conjuncts. Apart from Vedic accents, the only thing missing from the
original DOS word-processor (ALP) is vocalic "l", which seems to have been
missed out by mistake (long vocalic "r" is included). I've printed lots of
Sanskrit out this way, and it looks very nice. I haven't acquired a copy
of the new Windows program (LEAP), so can't report on it: I hope to buy a
copy while I'm in Pune in August, and I'll try and remember to post any
observations I have on it.
