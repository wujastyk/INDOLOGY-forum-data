Sanskrit translations in Nazi hands
In the USENET news groups (cf. searches of www.dejanews.com),
there are thousands of postings where Nazis used
translations from Sanskrit (Vedas, Bhagavad Giithaa, etc.,)
to take blood oaths, etc.,
Are there academic scrutiny of this Nazi usage of Sanskrit
materials? Any references?
