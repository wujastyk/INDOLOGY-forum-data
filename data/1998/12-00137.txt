I do not know Dr. RJZ personally.  His various postings have
been cotroversial and the views are partisan.  I always
thought partisan views had no place in a discussion group
like this.  Putting Vivekananda's prceived racism is no academic
research, in my opinion..  Those are in politics and religion which
have their own forums for debate.
Noboby should accept anything because it has an origin.
Hence, why should we accept all that simply came from India?
At the same time, to look down on Indian scholarship and
India's contributions is individual's choice and is not
a scholarly pursuit.
Let me say that it is disturbing to see the strong partisan
current of the exchanges in this list.  I sincerely hope
that all join in objective Indologic research without any
religious or nationalistic bias.  Let's try..
