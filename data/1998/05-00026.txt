Dear Mr.N.Ganesan,
                        This is the limit I think. Do you really believe
that God prefers Tamil to Sanskrit or for that matter any other language?
Let not chauvinism deteriorate to arrogance.The moral of the story is
that God prefers sincerity and simplicity to sophistication and arrogance
of learning. Not that Tamil is the preferred language of Gods. Tamil
arrogance is equally abhorring to God as is Sanskrit arrogance. Do you
realise such postings can be annoying to list members?

                        You quoted somebody to say that Sanskrit is a rough
language. Do you know the name by which your language is known in Andhra?
It is called "Aravam" , a voiceless language. This word is current
in Andhra and it is in usage even before I was born. What
sounds as sweet to some people sounds as harsh or listless to other
people. Do show some consideration for the feelings of other people on the
list.

regards,

sarma.
