In a message dated 98-05-18 21:39:51 EDT, you write:

<< Is it clear from the Harappan artefacts that the
 professions of a potter and a blacksmith were
 differentiated at that time, ca. 3000 B.C.? >>
I do not have access to Ratnagar's book now. When I am able to get it in the
next couple of weeks, I shall check it.
