Indic Roman
Dear Members of Indology,
Does anyone have access to a font called Indic Roman?  I am attempting to
recover some files of one of our colleagues and my computer
assures me that at least some of his files were written using this font.
Unfortunately, the font is nowhere to be found in the materials with
which I am working.
Any assistance in this matter would be much appreciated.
