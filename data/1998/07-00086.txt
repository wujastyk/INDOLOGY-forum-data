And that is because immediately before the SPEC to I position (generally subject position) there is a COMPlement, the landing place for preambles, and raised phrases, like subordinated clauses and indirect objects, like in your example ``to the man a book etc''. In your example, the book still is the subject. Elements are moved to COMPlement in order to provide stress, emphasis, as we all know without studying Generative Grammar.

COMP - SU - V - Obj - IObj.

Certainly! Simple and adequate. It is a nice mnemonic aid. Remember, however, it is not an explanation, it's only an adequate help to your memory.
