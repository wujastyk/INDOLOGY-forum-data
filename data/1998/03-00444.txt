Indo-Aryan migration vs Indigenous origin - scholarly debate
Upon netsurfing, I found an interesting website of
NRIs. It is at www.indiastar.com. It has
nice poems (eg., on Nataraja of Chidambaram by
a girl born in US), articles (An Indian engineer/scientist's
life in USA by Kollengode Venkataraman, Indian Roads by
Palaniswami of Hinduism Today, ..)
It hosts glorious reviews of books by S. C. Kak (faculty
in electrical engg., at Louisiana state university),
David Frawley, etc., of Indigenous Aryan school.
What is interesting is the Bookforum where issues on
Ancient India are discussed by indigenous Aryan schoolers.
Samplers of recent postings by Sri. Subrahmanya who
writes in Indology on his views of linguistics, apparent
non-distictions between kannada/telugu and sanskrit
and Dr. S. C. Kak are given below.
It will be interesting to see the archives for 1997 and 1996.
Only 1998 is there at www.indiastar.com bookforum.
