Horses/Indus seals
Hi,
I agree with Edwin Bryant.
Why should it be assumed that the seals should show
all the animals with which the people of the civilization were
familiar? Do we know the significance of the animals depicted as field
symbols (to use the phrase of Mahadevan) or pictorial motifs (to use
the phrase of Parpola)? In fact, to my knowledge, none of the
decipherment claims so far has addressed the problem of animals on the
inscriptions. Animal motifs and glyphs combine in curious ways to
constitute messages on inscriptions...
Regards,
Kalyanaraman.
