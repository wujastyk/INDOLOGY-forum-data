SV: On logic and fuzziness

It may be true that (some) scientists/engineers do whatever it is you

However, my recommendations are a lot simpler (at least for a start). I
am simply
asking for a standardization of semantic distance. And that necessitates
the use of
the concept of distance. Nobody can go far without it. Once the concept
of distance
becomes embedded in linguistics many problems will solve themselves.
The more difficult a problem is the more powerful the tools must be.
The more complex the problem is, the more powerful the tools must be.
Linguistics has been blessed with lots of measurable things so it is in
much better
shape than say, psychology or even parts of sociology. If math is good
enough for them,
for physicists, engineers and everyone else, it is good enough for
linguists.
It's irrational to deny it or claim the opposite.
The worst that can happen is that at least some of the more farfetched
claims and
ridiculous and fuzzy methodologies will be clearly seen for what they
are. Understanding
is the key to a solution.
First analysis, then synthesis.
One does not need complete sets. Economists are faced with this problem
and have devised
ways to get around it.
