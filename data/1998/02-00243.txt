Bibliography of Max Muller
A patron is trying to find out if Max Muller routinely wrote books reviews,
and in particular one of Alfred Percy Sinnett's book Esoteric Buddhism.
The bibliography of MM's writings in his autobiography Life and Letters of
the Rt. Hon. Friedrich Max Muller is very short and confines itself almost
entirely to independent books.  The patron is looking through MM's various
collections of essays on his own.
Did Muller write little in journals?
Is there a detailed bibliography somewhere?
Thanks for any help.
