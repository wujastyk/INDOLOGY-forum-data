Neither do I. I cannot escape the impression that your, rather unrealistic, example might have the following underlying structure,

A2)  `x - to_have dumped - tea - into the ocean - by the revolutionaries'

which on its turn has the underlying active structure

A1) `the rev. - to_dump - tea - into the ocean'

After A2, the ocean has been raised to specifier position SPEC of I (subject position), leaving a trace in the form of the correlated neutral pronoun `it'. Finally, there is a chain `ocean - it', with `ocean' indeed in a subject position, but with the remaining loc phrase still in place. `it' has substituted `ocean'. I cannot see this as an example of LOC to SUBJECT.

A3) the ocean - had have dumped - tea - into it(self) - by the revolutionaries
