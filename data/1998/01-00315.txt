As regards Bijoy Mishra's comments I fail to see why he took offense
at Fred Smith's mail. I found nothing derogatory about the tone of
Fred Smith's mail. It is a fact that politics and religion combine
together (more a rule than exception!) to form a dirty mess and it is
also a fact that bribery is rampant in Indian courts. Why object to
calling a spade a spade?
