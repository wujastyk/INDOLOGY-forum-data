This -again- is a typical example of the kind of selective argumentation
we are swamped with on this list. The facts are:
In Old Iranian we only have aiva (O.Pers.) and aEuua, Oiuua  (Avestan)
In Middle Persian we have Ev, Evak ( < *aivaka, NOT *aika!!!) and
and thus, in  New Persian we have yak.
-ka suffixes are about the most common in Middle Persian (and Skt.) and
added virtually everywhere.
(Actually, even Avestan has something like the preform: aEuuAkam 'at the
same time", from *aeuuAka-)
One look into Bartholomae's Altiranisches Woerterbuch would have helped to
avoid this kind of selective argumentation.
Rather, the dialect difference between Pre-vedic *aika "1" and Pre-Iranian
*aiva"1" (and, maybe, reinforced by *aiva-ka!) is old; note that Vedic has
specialized a presumable IIr *aiva > adverb eva "only".
        (and did I not say: " Seems to be an old dialect
        difference. But a slim one." ???)
It seems to me that the my main point was completely missed: Iranian used
-va, IA used -ka (and other IE *-no) for "1".
Philology = "slow reading".
The question of Vedic diphtongs is quite separate from all of this. I also
think that we might prove -inner Vedic- that the RV people still
pronounced ai, au , not yet e, o. But you did not say *how* to show it
INSIDE the Vedic texts.
But what about above:
As every 1st year student of hist. lingustics knows, IIr is characterized
by *azd,azdh,  retained in Iranian -azd-, while Vedic has got rid of such
combinations > ed, edh.
(best example perhaps is: the perfect of sad : *sa-zdai > Ved. sede but
retained as Young Avestan haz-de)  Typical innovations in RV follow suit:
perfects such as man: mene, nam: neme etc.  etc..
Thus, in sum: "Mitanni-Aryan" has the pre-Vedic stage Also characterized
by aika (not aiva, aivaka!). -az- is not found in Ved. any more. And that
development has been used to build a whole new class of perfects. A wide
gap separates the Mitanni and RV forms of IA.  (implications for
dating??)
All of this has been well known since Kammenhuber's Habil. thesis on
Kikkuli's horse treatise, Mayrhofer's "Mythos", etc. etc. As Prof.
Krishnamurti once wrote: do we have to give intro-s to linguistics here?
This merely repeats S.S. Misra, The Aryan problem 1992, who is "famous"
for his his IE. *a = Greek e,o,a;  no laryngeals; IE.  z (as in Ved.
azva-s = IE *azvas!!!) instead of *k', etc. etc.  ----  And already
answered by Prof. Vassilkov.
Perhaps it is better to select other types of "selective argumentation".
