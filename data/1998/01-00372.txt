Sly cats
A propos the thread cat it might be helpful
to consider an aphorism from G. Gurdjieff
who lived in Tibet for quite a time where
he was initiated. It may reflect a tibetan view:
" A man is not a pig to forget good, nor is he
a cat to remember evil
(Life  is Real only then, when "I Am " pag 56 )
