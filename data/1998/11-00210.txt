   Wait a minute :-)
   Your information seems to be legendary. This is
   not a strong motif in the entire Sanskrit corpus
   of letters. Tiny percenatge just like the horse
   in 10 Greek legends.
   Furthermore, you are ignoring the fact that there
   is absolutely NO archaeological evidence.
   Note that this idea must have hopped over
   to India like Buddhism to Japan.
