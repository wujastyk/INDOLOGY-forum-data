Horse
Introducing lightly myself in the Edwin/George debate:
Dear both,
        The problem of few horses' remains in India evoke the same problem
in Mycenian Greece. In fact, both lands don't are well lanscaped for a
military use of the war chariot and we can suppose that the link between
horses and Eurindians was necessarily limited in both cases to the
maintening of strong religious traditions as royal sacrifices, ritual horse
races, &c., just needing a few lot of horses!
        The overwhelming role played by the war chariot in the epic warfare
don't is a proof of real use. Even for the people who suppose Trojan War
and Kurukshetra were historical wars, there is no need to believe the
equipment of Akhilleus or Arjuna was exactly described by Homer or Vyasa.
Horses' hooves need a smooth herbous plain and the same is true for the
manoeuvrability of the chariot. Such conditions were probably satisfied in
the "Eurindian birthland", not in Greece nor in India.
        Cordially,
