If it is of any help, I can state that the interpretation of John is the
interpretation given to the sUtra bhAshhya by the orthodox sha.nkara
maTha-s like Sringeri. Namely, shUdra-s are not qualified to
recite/study veda-s, but are open to receiving moxa. According to this
view, eligibility of karma depends on caste while moxa does not depend
on caste, since moxa arises from knowledge not karma. I can give
references (from Sringeri publications) if anyone is interested. Also
refer to Yoshitsugu Sawai's paper "Samkara's theory of Samyasa", in JIP,
Vol 14, 1986, pp. 371-387 on how sureshvara explicitly disagrees with
sha.nkara on the caste issue (though he also excludes shudra-s) in the
bR^ihadAraNyaka vArttika (also mentioned by Vidyasankar).
