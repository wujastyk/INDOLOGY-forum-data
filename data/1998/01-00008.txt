What I understand from a Professor of sanskrit is that sva has two meanings
(applicable in this context) - one pronoun and another adjective (MMW  also
says so).

sva - oneself (pronoun)
sva - one's own (adjective)

In the case sva being used as a pronoun "svasya maataa-pitrooh" is correct.
If you use sva as adjective you should use "svayooh maataa-pitrooh".

Please do not thank me. I got it from Dr.P.Sriramachandrudu, Retired Professor
of Sanskrit,Osmania University, Hyderabad.

regards,

sarma.
