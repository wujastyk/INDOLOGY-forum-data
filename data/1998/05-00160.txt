 This origin myth of Ganesa is different from the majority
 of tamil/sanskrit stories on Ganesa's birth. You must
 hear this tEvaaram sung by an Otuvaar in a "siva
 temple to realize the power.

This origin myth is the subject of a lesson in the Tamil Reader authored by
James Lindholm and K. Paramasivam. This book was used in the '70s and early
'80s in US universities that offered courses in Tamil. I do not know if it is
still being used.
