P. K. Manansala writes:
I posted some time ago, a broad cultural complex that spread from
Manchuria to Eastern Europe among the Altaic, Uralic and "Scythian"
peoples. Some thought the complex rather general although I found it
much more specific and wide-ranging that horse culture referred to here.

     I could not find your writing about cultural complex
     from Eastern Europe to Manchuria. I will appreciate
     some elaboration.

     Thanks,
