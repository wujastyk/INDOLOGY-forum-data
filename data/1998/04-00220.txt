[Editorial comment] (was Re: Proposed BJP Government Watch (BJW)              Article)
Thank you, Gentlemen, for your information.
However, the INDOLOGY discussion group will best serve the causes of free
speech, open thought, and liberal government by remaining focussed on
scholarly matters concerning the discovery and interpretation of
pre-modern Indian history, language, and culture.
Please, please refrain from using INDOLOGY for political or ideological
debate.  There are many forums for such matters, but few for the sorts of
academic, university-level discussion of Indian history, language, and
culture for which INDOLOGY was founded.
If we show no restraint in this matter, we will bring the INDOLOGY forumn
into disrepute.  There are already many people who do not read INDOLOGY
because it carries too much slack argumentation not based on scholarly
canons.  I consider the signal-to-noise ration to be still high enough for
the forum to be a serious and valuable contribution to indologists, but it
is sometimes a close call.
Please keep the discussion to matters to do with the scholarly
interpretation of Indian culture, history, language, and art.  Computer
matters bearing directly on promoting indology, and indological job
advertisements, book announcements, and lecture/seminar/course information
is also welcome.
Thank you.
