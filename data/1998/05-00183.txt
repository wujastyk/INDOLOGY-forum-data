Plato in Sanskrit
Dear Wayne:
I saw your posting on Indology, and was wondering if you're the same guy
who was a t McMaster. If so, hi.
Hope you're doing well. As you can see from the return address, I'm now at
Australian National University, where I teach courses on Buddhism, Modern
India, and lots of other things.
Cheers,
John Powers
