You have to be careful. There may be other words that signify "one"
such as "single" in English.

No, you can't tell what people spoke by a few recovered documents.
For example, there are many old tombstones in insular Southeast Asia
with Arabic inscriptions.  Yet these do not indicate the language spoken
by the people.  Likewise you can find plenty of evidence of Arabic
right after the Arab invasion of Central Asia. The Sakas who invaded
India quickly adopted Indic languages; the Parthians adopted Persian;
the Mongols of Samarkand adopted Turkish, etc., etc.

What is more important to me is that Iranians that we know of with
certainty were far from the Scythians in cultural milieu.  But the
Mongols, Huns, Hsiung-nu, Avars, Kipchaks and the like possessed nearly
identical cultures.

I'm afraid the same thing can be said regarding most of the Iranian
etymologies you have given.  Practically all the words you cited, if
given time and energy, could be linked to Uralic, Altaic or any other
non-IE language.

According to recent archaeological finds, the Scythians had extended all
the way to Mongolia and Siberia.  Do we find Indo-Iranian substratum
influence here?  I think there is plenty of evidence of Uralic and
Altaic (or proto-, pre-) in the region of the Urals and Caucasus.
