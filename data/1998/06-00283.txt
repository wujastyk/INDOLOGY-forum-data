Draft transliteration scheme on the Web
Dear Colleagues
Many thanks to all who contributed to the recent discussion.   It is
important that it was raised.
It is not critical that l_macr-b uses the diacritic otherwise used by
alveolars.   It is the choice of LC Tables for both Malayalam and Tamil,
hence common in library catalogs and listed as plain 'l' in their
computers.    Also, it is commonly used when transliterating S Indian
scripts in scholarly works.   Hence I shall put this in the draft standard.
LC Tables for Kannada have l_dia-b, which (like r_dia-b) makes for poor
readability.   The draft standard will have l_macr-b uniformly.
