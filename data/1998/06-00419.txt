One of Earliest excommunications from vedic religion
One of Earliest excommunications from vedic religion
[...]
The author of this section in the PuraaNa must have included
them in his own mind. ONLY, to excommunicate them later!
Does one of the reasons for excommunication have anything to do with
beef? Obviously, there is quite a bit of beef in the Vedic.
After Aryans (gently) intruded into India, they learnt to
avoid it wheras Yavanas, etal., continue comsuming.
Like systemic retroflexion, I believe the beef avoidance more due to
the local habits' catalytic effect than the internal independent development.
Even as late as in Classical Sangam texts, the great poet Kapilar,
a brahmin confesses to his relishing of meat dishes.
Kapilar may well predate VishupuraaNa by a 1000 years.
