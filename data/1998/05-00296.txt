 nVNI> I differ with Robert Zydenbos for the following reasons

I fear that I must give a very dull response here: all the vacanas of Basava say "kuu.dalaSA:NGAMAdeeva", and never "kuu.dalaSA:NGAdeeva".

I have not yet read the Basavapuraa.na; but I hope to be back in India soon, and then I am curious to see whether this is there in the Kannada version too. And of course we would have to see where else "sa:nga" is used, if it is used elsewhere.

Without having at all seen the puraa.na yet, I think I may mention here that scholars in Karnataka, while appreciating Soomanaatha's work in general, are not always equally impressed with his sense of history, and that what he says at times is in conflict with other historical sources. He apparently wrote more as a devotee than as a scholar (which of course should not be held against him! Just as we do not dismiss Rembrandt as a painter because he dressed up a few biblical characters in 17th-century armour).
