  See Grimes, The Naiskarmyasiddhi of Suresvara, p. xii for a
bibliographical list, all of R. Balasubramanian's books on Suresvara's
works, and The Dakshinamurti Stotra, text and trans by Alladi Mahadeva
Sastry of Samata Books, Madras.There is also a book in the Univ of Madras
Philosophy library which contains one of the longer descriptions I have
seen. However, I am sorry to say that I no longer recall the title of the
book. It was put out by the Kancipuram Math some time in the 1960's or
early 70's
