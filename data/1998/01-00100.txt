Kotishila
I will be grateful for any information about the kotishila story in Jain
puranas: the story's synopsis, where it occurs, secondary literature about
it, etc. In particular I am interested in possible ties to the narratives
of Jain Ramayanas and Mahabharatas: Do Lakshaman and \ or Krsna participate
in lifting it?
Thanks,
Yigal Bronner.
