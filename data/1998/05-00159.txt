SamskRtasubodhinI
Dear Indology Members,
        I have received a number of messages from different colleagues
indicating that my Sanskrit textbook SamskRtasubodhinI is out of print.
Just to clarify the situation, the book is not yet out of print and is
still available from the Center for South and Southeast Asian Studies at
the University of Michigan.  Their phone number is: (734) 764-0352.  Their
email address is:    csseas at umich.edu
        All the best,
                                        Madhav Deshpande
