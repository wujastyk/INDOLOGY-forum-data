Henry W. Bellew's "From the Indus to the Tigris",
London 1874, on page 56.

The illustrated structures, although much smaller, look very similar
to stupas.  Bellew: "They are erected to the memory of
clansmen who have died without issue........"

Could these be distant memories to a buddhist past ?

Any clues/ opinions as to these structures ?
