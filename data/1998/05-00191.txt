>Some scientists believe the
domesticated chicken originated in Southeast Asia, but that it spread
at least partly, in an indirect fashion to other parts of the world.

Domesticating a chicken is not so much dependent on technique and long-term
planning as domesticating, breeding, employing and taking care of horses . . .
A main-frame computer system (say) is quickly sold, but needs follow up care by
the producing company for years . . .
