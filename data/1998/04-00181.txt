The position I think is that if one does not find a mantra for
particular deity, use the mantra in which a word corresponding to
the name of the deity occurs.

In the Hindu pantheon there are deities who are later additions.
One cannot hope to find mantras corresponding to them in the veda.
Either you have to write the mantras or assign them mantras by the
above method.

e.g.,

budha - udbudhya
          ^^^^
angAraka - agnirmUrdhA
           ^^^^

I do not know how they fix a particular m mantra when there are
anumber mantras containing the required word.

sarma.
