Later history of Vijayanagara.  Attention is heavily
focussed on Kaveri deltas. NOT Krishna & Godavari deltas.
According to B. Stein summarizing decades of work on Vijayanaga by
100s of historians. (Vijayanagara, Cambridge UP, 1989)

Just continuing the courtly idiom established by Nayaks,
more than the Marathis' love for Telugu.
New Marathi chiefs maintain the status quo. For a century
or so, Nayaks gave patronage to Telugu in their courts.
So, the teachers etc. are deeply into Telugu in the court.
For Maratha rulers, their priorities, dangers are elsewhere.
Few children who get trained in Telugu, write in Telugu.

I hardly see Marathis writing Telugu patams/kiirthanams nowadays.
