not quite understanding why) that hypercorrection can occur at all. Literacy
actually increases this (plain 'literacy' is not the same as 'learning' and
'understanding').
A learned man knows the correct form of the word and he does not
try to hypercorrect. Yes, semiliterate also hypercorrect. But it
does not mean that illiterate do not hypercorrect. They get a vague
sort of idea of correct speech by listening to educated people and
by trying to imitate them hypercorrect. Taking a concrete example
the following is actually found on a signboard
        Sri ...... nAdhazwarabhRMdaM
which actually should be
        Sri ...... nAdaswarabRMdaM
Replacing 'd' and 'b' by 'dh' and 'bh' is done because the person thinks
that aspiration which is more prevelent in educated people's speech to
be the correct form. Similarly replacing 's' with 'z'. Most probably
an illeterate man dictated this sign to the painter who faithfully
reproduced it. Usually painters  who  paint a number of signboards are
better informed about the correct form of a word and can
do a better job if left to themselves.
Another one is writing 'zAkhAhAra' for 'zAkAhAra' (vegetarian food)
Hyderabad hotels are famous for this hypercorrection. This can be
called the semiliterate hypercorrection. But the customers are
reduced to animals eating tree branches.

Another new source of hypercorrections is Dooradarsan.
