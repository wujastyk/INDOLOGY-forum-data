Still a bit drunk of all those mixtures? Instead of three times A, it makes more fun with A, B, and C. So,
I have four bottles labeled A, B, C and X.
        I mix A & X and drink and get drunk.
        I mix B & X and drink and get drunk.
        I mix C & X and drink and get drunk
, which might led to the conclusion: X is the alcohol, neglecting the possibility of ABC being liquors.
Anyway, I like your joke; it keeps people alarmed at one-sided conclusions.
