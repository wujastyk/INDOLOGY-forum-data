freeware devanagari TTF
Dear Shishtas,
I wonder if anyone of you know of any freeware devanagari True Type fonts.
We want to be able to offer also devanagari, not only transcription, on our
pages - but in such case this font must be downloadable for everybody, thus
it must be free.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.
