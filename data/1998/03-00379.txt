Just two relevant extracts:
"According to the Mahavansa, the most important of the early Ceylonese
chronicles, Indo-Aryans had made their way along the coast of India to
Sri Lanka by about the fifth century B.C. ... evidence seems to indicate
that one wave of the initial migration was from north-west India. The
Mahavansa itself seems to provide evidence that settlers arrived from the
north-eastern parts of India too."

impression, 1991, pp. 18-19
:The original home of the first Indo-Aryan immigrants to Sri Lanka was
probably north-west India and the Indus region. There was, very likelz, a
later immigration from the east around Bengal and Orissa.

Hope this clarifies the point.
