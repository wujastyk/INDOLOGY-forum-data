scientific methods and arguments.
 Most indologists agree in calling the few centuries preceding the Delhi
Sultanate as a `dark age'. This was after the fall of the mighty empries
of the Mauryas and Guptas, after the Huns had invaded India. Many features
of post-Gupta society are considered barbaric by many. Thus they were in a
sense liberators.
Please note: Hindi, Hindu, Hindustani are all Perso-Arabic words. THey are
not found in original Sanskrit. The name of the language being non-IA is
against an IA origin of Hindustani.
The languages that existed before that empire weree Kanauji, Braj and
Mithili. They were never referred to as `Hindi' by their speakers, who
considered Hindi a short form of Hindustani, and hence a Muslim language.
Braj and Kanauji are still spoken, but their usage is declining, being
replaced by Hindustani, the language of the Mughal Empire.
