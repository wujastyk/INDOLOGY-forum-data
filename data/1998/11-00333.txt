The RSS prayer -- text, translation, and anecdotes

I think it is only fair to mention the fact that Mr. Banerjee is a
"well-known" leftist activist on the Net. The following URL can be
used to view some of his "activities" online:

I have not read the book Mr. Banerjee is promoting (and probably never
will - far too many other books to read first), but I would like to
caution potential readers about the heavy leftist bent of the author,
not to mention the fact that coincidentally, he comes from West
Bengal, which is one of the very few states of India to be under the
rule of the Communist Party of India.
Reading about the RSS from a leftist author is a bit like reading
about Tibetan history in a Chinese government handout, or reading
about American principles in an Iraqi newspaper. :-)
