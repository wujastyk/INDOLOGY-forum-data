bookstores?
I hope you actually referred to http://www.amazon.com  because
the http://www.amazone.com is not a bookshop.
Here I may say that our website http://www.dkagencies.com/booksearch
offers "Sanskrit" as a subject.  Selecting this subject yields
a list of those items which are published in English language
(may / may not include the original verse) and are critical
editions or translations of Vedic or Sanskrit works or on Sanskrit
language.
Our web development team is looking into the feasibility of
introducing an online database of works in Sanskrit also.
At present we are sending lists of Sanskrit books by email
and in paper format. Interested readers are requested to
indicate their preference.
