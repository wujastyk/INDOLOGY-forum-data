Homeland vs AI/M (was erroneously Horses)
Dear Mr Subrahmanya,
        You post:
        I suspect that, behind rhetoric and humour, you intend to give
symmetric roles to both adversaries. I'm afraid you're wrong. The "cause"
of the AI/M "protagonists" is not an holy one, just a scholary one.
        Regards,
Dominique

for their great step towards the end of this horrible Kaliyuga...
