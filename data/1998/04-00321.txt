human sacrifice and death penalty
It may be (although I'm not sure) that some criminals actually DESERVE the
death penalty as punishment for the awful crimes they have committed.  In
other words, the point may not be deterrence; and revenge and retribution
are not (necessarily) identical.  I agree, however, that this has nothing to
do with human sacrifice in any religious context.
