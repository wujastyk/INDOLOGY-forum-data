Yes, Jacob, but Norwegian vegetarians are a fairly recent phenomenon. Until
quite recently, fish and meat was part of every Norwegian's diet if he could
afford such things. (People would often subsist on herring, potatoes, and
porridge and would not necessarily be able to buy meat on a regular basis).
I think modern vegetarianism is an imported phenomenon.
