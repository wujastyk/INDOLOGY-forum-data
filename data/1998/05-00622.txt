Sorry, that should be Iranian rather than IE.
Doesn't Vasistha make a sacrifice to Vishnu in Chap. VII?  Vishnu is
possibly an aboriginal god with a Dravidian name. I don't see
anything particularly different between V's style/ritual and the
rest of the RV.
The divine birth of V together with Agastya in a pot is said by some
to indicate aboriginal origin.  Such devices were often used to
explain divine births as in the case of the birth of the Pandavas,
who all had the same mother but different divine fathers.  I think
that the later association of V with Eastern India cannot be ignored.
But the question is do they contain material that is not
contemporary.  Is there interpolation, and how many different
variants did KD have to sort through.  What did traditions did he use
to sort the good from the bad?  Finally what periods are the Vedas
contemporary to?
Yes, but most of the specialists use the age of the language to date
the Rgveda!  I was only using the prevailing logic.  As far as I'm
concerned the RV could have been written around ~500 BCE rather than
~1500 BCE.
Not a question of whether they exist, but whether the Eurocentric
mindset will accept.
But horse burial is common.  A single burial with a horse's head just
doesn't get it.  Maybe that was all that was left of the poor
fellow's horse after a battle.  Or maybe it was just a local
variation.
But I'm confused.  You're referring now to RV culture rather than IE?
Why would we find an RV burial in the Urals so early?
