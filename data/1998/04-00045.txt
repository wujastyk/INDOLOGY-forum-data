I was really referring to the regions that had been abandoned.  I
really don't think the IVC people have disappeared either.  You can
still see the same type of faces displayed in IVC art in India today.
Conditions may have caused mass migrations; possibly similar to what
happened in the Holocene Sahara.

Btw, do you know what eventually happened to the Inca civilization?

Somewhat surprising that nothing similar to the great Mayan centers
have been found in the period between the fall of IVC and the Mauryan
empire. One would have expected the first great post-IVC urban centers to
develop in the former IVC region but instead they pop up in East India.
