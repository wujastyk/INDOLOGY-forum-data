Dear Netters,
I posted this message to the List during vacation time, which may be
the reason why it elicited absolutely no response.
Therefore I take the liberty of asking again:
Could any knowledgeable person help me with identifying the source
of the following quotation, a verse that is said to have influenced
young Gandhi's views?

"But the truly noble know all men are one
And return with gladness good for evil done."

Gratefully Yours, J.F.
