Aside:
(Enjoyed your webpage on The Cosmic Dancer.
The dwarf at the feet of Nataraja at Chidambaram and elsewhere
is called "muyalakan" in Tamil. I think it was written as
"muuyaalakan" at the webpage.)
Friends,
I shall be grateful for guidance on literature on the subject of ancient

icons
of gods and goddesses carrying weapons (apart from the classics of TA
Gopinatha Rao and JN Banerjea). In particular, on s'akti pi_t.has in NW

ndia
and the iconography of Durga as mother goddess in ancient India and
perha=
ps in
Mesopotamia.
Thanks and best regards,
