Aside:
(Enjoyed your webpage on The Cosmic Dancer.
The dwarf at the feet of Nataraja at Chidambaram and elsewhere
is called "muyalakan" in Tamil. I think it was written as
"muuyaalakan" at the webpage.)

Friends,

I shall be grateful for guidance on literature on the subject of ancient
=
icons
of gods and goddesses carrying weapons (apart from the classics of TA
Gopinatha Rao and JN Banerjea). In particular, on s'akti pi_t.has in NW
I=
ndia
and the iconography of Durga as mother goddess in ancient India and
perha=
ps in
Mesopotamia.

Thanks and best regards,
Dr. S. Kalyanaraman
