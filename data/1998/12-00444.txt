Indian children born abroad -- RSS and Vivekananda
I would like to know from Mr. Misra why he thinks this thread is
non-Indologic. Of course, namecalling or racist remarks are not to be
encouraged. But discussions on one of the most important issues of India
today (i.e., the politics of Hindutva and the rise of fascism) - how can
they be irrelevant to Indology?
Why censor this discussion just because it has political connotations?
