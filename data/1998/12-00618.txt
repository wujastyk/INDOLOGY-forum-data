As I said (or didn't say) my observations are based on extensive

done.  What gets written is cursory and is biased to support one
view or the other, in the name of the totality.
I hope the choice of the word "sermon" was not sarcastic.
To some, any contradictory opinion may sound like a sermon.
I know this since I say similar stuff to the organizers
in the local temple and they would use the word "sermon"
to ignore it.  Listening itself is an art.
The variety that seems to be a part of scholarly work does not
enter the fabric of life.  The variety appears to be in
religious parctices, but not in the philosophy of life.
The latter would not present itself unless one lives with
people and understands their intrinsic nature.  I am not
clear how an illiterate man in a remote area develops this
broad intrinsic nature of universality and mysticism.
But you discover it by just travelling around the country
and meeting ordinary people.
good point.  I try.  At least have developed strong fluency
in Sanskrit and read Sanskrit literature as time permits.
