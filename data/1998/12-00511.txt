This is probably the correct interpretation. In the Tamil tradition, paTTin2am
referred to a coastal town. Also, vajra has an association with indra.
KavirippUmpaTTin2am was said to have seven indra viharas as the following text
shows.

paNai aintu Ogkiya pAcilaip pOti
aNi tikaz nIzal aRavOn2 tirumozi
