I'm aware of the last article, and the analysis of the author is
simply Kennewick-style mishmash.  For those unfamiliar with
Kennewick, it involves claims by certain anthropologists that crania
found in the Northwest U.S. are "Pre-Caucasoid." The arguments they
use are easily refuted.  For example, Chatters suggests that the
Sundadont dental type of Kennewick Man is suggestive of ancient
Caucasoid. However, any familiar with the topic knows that the term
"Sundadont" was originally constructed to describe Southern Mongoloid
dentition.  You find other scholars also using this Sundadont pattern
now to suggest ancient Siberians were "Pre-Caucasoid."

He is referring only to "typical Mongoloid" features, and even here
he is incorrect.  The skulls do show features like prognathism and
broad nasal bones which are "Mongoloid" characteristics

Not really.  The suggestion is that they show "Primitive Caucasoid"
characteristics.  For example, a steep mandible is somehow mentioned
as a "Caucasoid" characteristic.  However, steep mandibles hardly a
modern typical feature of Caucasoids.  They are very common among
some contemporary and modern Southeast Asian/Pacific populations.
Another error is claiming palatine torus is a "Caucasoid"
characteristic.  The highest rates of palatine torus occur among
Eskimos and Polynesians.

There are about 100 mummies and many other remains.  There is also
abundant genetic evidence that modern and ancient residents of
Xinkiang are closely related to East Asian types.   Here are a few to
look over:

However, I need  to warn that there are many problems with bias in genetic studies
There is a distinct racial element in all these studies that cannot
be ignored.  The roots are old and more submerged now, but they still
certainly exist. The Kennewick conflict is just one very prominent
sign of this problem.

I've pasted two abstracts relating to Sundadonty and palatine torus
that will clear us some of these mispresentations of "Caucasoid"
traits.

 ABSTRACT:       In this paper, the dental morphology of prehispanic Meso-
|                american populations is described, compared, and examined
|                within the context of New World dental variation. Twenty-
|                eight morphological dental traits were studied and compared
|                in four samples of prehispanic Mexican populations. After
|                eliminating intra- and interobserver error, the dental
|                morphological characteristics observed show evidence of
|                heterogeneity among the populations. In particular, the
|                oldest population, Tlatilco (1300-800 BC), was significantly
|                different from the other three groups, Cuicuilco (800-100
|                BC), Monte Alban (500 BC-700 AD) and Cholula (550-750 AD).
|                When the four samples were compared to other Mongoloid
|                populations, either univariately or multivariately, it was
