and the Indo-Iranian culture, with its emphasis on the horse
developed in situ, after the domesticated horse reached them via
trade. In fact, one archaeologist, in South Asian Archaeology '95,
noted that various features considered to be hallmarks of Vedic
culture arise and spread in this area, rather than marching lockstep
from Central Asia, in a Northwest to Southeast direction.
It is not good scholarship to ignore this model, even if it is good
politics/propaganda.
