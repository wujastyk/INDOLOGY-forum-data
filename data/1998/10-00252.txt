I'm looking for any news concerning BHAGVAN SINH'S "Apne-apne Raam". It's a novel published in ca. 1994. I heard that it's been very controversial in India. Especially I'm interested in anything about the concept of the state and society in this novel. I've got its photocopy in Hindi, but my Hindi's been lacking a lot and I don't have too much time.
Thank you very much
