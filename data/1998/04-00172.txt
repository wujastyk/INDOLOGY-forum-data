Humans, animals and plants
Thanks to Mr. Ramakrishnan Balasubramanian for the references
on Siva. I have seen all of them. They are only bit & pieces
of info, in my humble opinion.
A monograph in two volumes, one from Sanskrit and another
from Tamil/Dravidian literatures, on "The Rise of Siva
in Hindu tradition" is YET to be written. Something on the
lines of "The rise of the Goddess in the Hindu tradition".
I have outlined some sources to be looked into
in a prior posting.
Yours,
N. Ganesan
