Paired Horse and PIE breakup

Well these latter examples are really relevant.  Buddhism started in
India, but often is transmitted by non-Indians.  For example, Chinese
were largely responisble for the spread of Buddhism in Japan.  Tibetans
and Japanese have done the most to spread Buddhism in the United States.
So religion and technology are not language or "race" specific.  They
skip from one language or ethnic group to another.  Thus, attempting
to judge the breakup of PIE on the spread of horse rituals and/or
chariot technology is open to much criticism.
One thousand years before what?  Were there other migrations, other than
the Vedic ones that accounted for the appearance of the Indian scripts?
They might be or they might not.  Your evidence appears to be mainly
legendary.  The earliest hypothesized archaeological evidence of
"ayrans" is Painted Grey Ware culture.  And many do not accept PGW as
IA (see the Allchin's work on urban growth).  The culture could be as
late as the 6th century BCE or just a few centuries before the first
inscriptions appear.
