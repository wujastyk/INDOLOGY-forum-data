1. Whatever be N.s.Rajaram's other faults, humility does not seem to
figure among them....It sure takes a lot of self-confidence to put
oneself in the same category of people as Jacobi et al...To suggest that
Georg Feuerstein and JAcobi are "co-workers" is obviously
insulting to the later.....

2. Rajaram claims that Jacobi the mathematician was influenced by Vedic
mathematics...Has anybody seen this elsewhere? I've read about the life
of Jacobi in three different places but donot remember seeing any such
thing there...

3. Rajaram refers to Kosambi's work and the class theory etc etc...
Where does Kosambi use class theory to justify Aryan invasion or
migration? AFAIK, he uses the "class theory" to bash and beat up
the quality of Samskrt poetry written in the 6th-12th centuries..
In fact, Ingalls who edited the "zubhAzitaratnakOSa:" with Kosambi also
points this out and expresses his disagreement with the same..
Kosambi's dating of the gItA( where he differs from others) is based
mainly on grammatical analysis and has nothing to do with "class
