Well that is my intention.  But (unlike the good old days of yore) no one
can nowadays pretend be a specialist in: South Asian linguistics, IE
historical linguistics, SA archaeology, Central Asian archaeology, Vedic
philology, Avestan, Vedic and Babylonian Astronomy, 18th and 19th century
European history, 19th century Indian Nationalist history, and 20th
century Indian nationalist and post-colonial history (amongst other
things) all at the same time.  So I have to decide whether to spend the
next decade on this thing, to cover every single possible minutia (by
which time it'll all be out of date and the whole debate settled or
passe'), or make sure I have thoroughly outlined the basic infrastructure
of the problem from all points of view and make it available in a timely
and useful fashion.  What do you think?    Edwin Bryant
