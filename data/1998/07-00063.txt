Yes, that's probably so, as the tea dumped into the oceans by the
revolutionaries was should have been grown in China. :-)


Thanks to Tim Cahill for his offlist correction of "ground" to "grown". He
also notes that the revolutionaries dumped the tea into the harbor, rather
than the ocean. Finally, he says:  "And anyway, they were dressed up as
Indians so there really *is* a connection". A rather loose connection. :-)
