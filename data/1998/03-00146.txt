Two questions - Taranatha and Robert Gussner
1. Though I am no Buddhism expert, the references that I see have Taranatha
born in 1575.  His "History of Buddhism in India" (Rgya gar chos 'byun) is
translated from the Tibetan in the following reference.

(I have no doubt that there are many such similarities in the hagiographies
of ancient Indian religious teachers.)
2. Gussner's doctoral dissertation (1973) and the JAOS article (1976)
covered mostly the same ground. The same seventeen strotras are mentioned in
each, and I do not think that the latter was the product of further
research. I have nearly completed my own PhD dissertation on statistical
authentication of some of Sankaracarya's works (mostly bhaashyas and other
philosophical compositions) and I would certainly be interested in further
work in this field by Gussner, but sadly I do not think there is any.
As for Gussner's conclusions about the authenticity of any of the stotras, I
would have to hold them in doubt for the following reasons:
(a) He selects only seventeen stotras on the advice of another scholar that
these are the most likely to be genuine.
(b) He uses for quantitative evidence a few dozen medium to high frequency
words, some of which are doubtless context-sensitive (e.g. avidyA, saMsAraH,
bhakti) and others that are relatively insensitive (e.g. yathA/tathA, tu,
yadvat/tadvat) and assumes that if the author of the stotras and the
metrical portion of the Upadesha SAhasrI is one and the same Sankaracarya,
then the frequencies of all of these selected words would be nearly equal.
This in itself is a difficult assumption to defend, and neither  does the
evidence support it.
(c) In a more traditional philological analysis, Gussner examines the
occurrences of bhakti, hRd, and Ananda, assuming (perhaps rightly) that
these words are definite indicators of spurious authorship in the Sankara
corpus. Only the DakShiNAmUrti stotra passes as authentic due to the
non-occurrence of these words.
(d) Gussner uses the metrical portion of the Upadesha SAhasrI as his control
sample of true Sankara authorship, but he calls into question various
sections of that work when they fail to meet the above criteria of authenticity.
However, Gussner's work is important if only for his assiduous editing and
collation of manuscripts for the seventeen stotras, including documenting
from where in India each manuscript was recovered.
I do have a copy of Gussner's dissertation on microfilm, but for copyright
reasons I think I am bound not to distribute further copies. However, if you
want to know more about its contents, then I guess I could oblige.
The following reference is the only other Gussner work that I know of.  I
would be happy to hear of others.
