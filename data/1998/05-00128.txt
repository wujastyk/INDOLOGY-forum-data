My list:
1) Index of Indian place names: If established, it will help to
determine the Dravidian/Munda subdstratum by specialists.

2) Index of Literary motifs: Comparative study of ideas,
diffusion, iconography will become easier if material
from important Indic languages are established.

3) Bibliography: Good to see that BAS is on the web.
M. L. Patterson's book & the like must get on the web.
What about Indian language books lists in Roman and indian
language scripts. What is very scarce is a good handle on
research material published in Indian languages.

4) Lists of Manuscripts - in palm leaves or on
paper, in important libraries.

5) Font translations: With the touch of a button, the tyranny of
script can become a thing of the past. Translations from
Sanskrit, Tamil etc., can provide the original text
in native script and roman with diacritics.
eg., Saivagamas from Pondichery French Inst. can be provided
in grantha, diacritical roman, nagari, etc.,
It will be easier to switch from one script to another
from font-neutral files. For eg.,
a famous hindi novel into gujarati script,
a malayalam work into tamil etc., can be done easily.
Bilingual editions are possible.

6) Historical dictionary: By loading all the texts in a particular
language & appr. date of the composition, a dictionary
of words and when it started its life in that language.

7) Saw elegant fonts for about 400 symbols used in Indus writings
developed by Prof. Parpola. If used widely, many can suggest;
may speed up the cracking the script, language.

8) Indian art webs: The huge collection of slides in French inst. of
Indology & AIIS can become available on the web. Accessors can be
charged a fee. Also the 4000+ Indus seals can be mounted
on webs for many to see.
