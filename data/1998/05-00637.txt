        Dear Sir,

                Probably doubts have arisen because SanaiScara
        is always regarded as a malevolent planetary deity.
        But the various nAmAvaLis for SanaiScara do praise
        and eulogise him with benevolent qualities. So in
        addition to names describing his fierce or malefic
        nature, we can also find many many names which give
        him benevolent attributes.
                As such, it should be varadha+abhaya+hastAya.
        In fact, in iconography, we come across two-armed and
        four-armed forms of SanaiScara. In the four-armed
        form, SanaiScara does have the abhaya and varadha
        mudras.
                The other nAma should also be,
                "bhakta+sangha+mana+abhIsta+phala+dAya"
                So you have to make your adjustments, I suppose:-)

        Regards

        Jayabarathi
