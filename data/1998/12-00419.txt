Madame Blavatsky and the swastika
This is pretty silly. The Nazis used both the cr oss and the svastika; that
does not make either of them racist symbols. The svastika has been used as
some kind of religious symbol rather widely in the Buddhist world and is of
course a rather old auspicious (and religious?) symbol in South Asia.
More generally, one should not confuse the ideas of the 1920s and 1939s
with those of a half century earlier in an entirely different context.
