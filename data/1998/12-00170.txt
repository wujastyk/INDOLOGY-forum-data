Of course there were contacts between ;Saivas all over South Asia. I
have read of a Virasaiva ;siva;sara.na of the 12th century who is said
to have migrated southward from Kashmir and to have composed vacanas in
Kannada. At the same time, the Virasaivas held the 63 ;Saiva saints of
the Tamil region in high esteem. Some people have written in Kannada on
similarities between Kashmir Saivism and Virasaivism.
