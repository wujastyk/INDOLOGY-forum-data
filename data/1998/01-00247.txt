I couldn't help but note the following from the Chronicle of Higher
Education for this past week, there is a website for Yiddish books, a
collection of some 44,000 titles--gleaned from some 1.4 million, 22,000 of
which are held at the center initiating the searchable resource.

           Yiddish Book Center Announces Plan to Digitize Its
           Collections By GOLDIE BLUMENSTYK
   For 18 years, the National Yiddish Book Center has used trucks,
handcarts, and an army of zamlers to rescue more than a million Yiddish
books and periodicals from the libraries and basements of aging
immigrants and their children and grandchildren.  Now the center is
turning to computer technology to help those zamlers -- or collectors --
preserve and share that literary legacy.  The center has announced plans
to scan and digitize the contents of its collection of more than 22,000
titles, and then to use those electronic "masters" to make the works
available to libraries, scholars, and students in electronic and print
formats.  The Center hopes to have its World-Wide Web site
(http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org) operating soon.

It is ludicrous to consider language as anything other
than that of which it is the transformation.
