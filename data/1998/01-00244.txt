Is that really a fair conclusion to draw from the above remark?  Really, what
does that say about you, that you would conclude anything of the sort?  I'm
sorry that you were stung by the remark and the implicit criticism, but you do
yourself no favors with your above snit.  It needn't be pointed out that of
course many if not most people who did not participate in the overall discussion
are in all capable of doing so, and chose not to for reasons of their own.  It's
quite an unflattering portrait you have painted of yourself, with this bitter
remark and the one which initiated the discussion in the first place.

dig out of the hole you dug for yourself.  What a pity you chose to jump back
in...
