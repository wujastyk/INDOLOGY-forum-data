Is that really a fair conclusion to draw from the above remark?  Really, what

are in all capable of doing so, and chose not to for reasons of their own.  It's
quite an unflattering portrait you have painted of yourself, with this bitter
remark and the one which initiated the discussion in the first place.
  It did, indeed; it's fortunate that the good colleagues of the list helped you
dig out of the hole you dug for yourself.  What a pity you chose to jump back
in...
