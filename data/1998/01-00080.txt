Help on sanskrit zloka
 Dear list members
I am currently editing and translating a manuscript of a
Sanskrit Anthology collected by RAma PratApa. Here I came
across some Sanskrit zlokas which are not clear to me. I shall
appreciate if anyone of you could kindly explain the following
one to me and also provide the exact reference if possible:
vedArdhayAntya iva te tu yapAdi yAyAc-
zAntam rasArdhanayanA~nghri vRzAkSipatram /
tad godhigArjunakareNa nirIkSitesmin
bhUyo bramiSyati na jAtvabalAdipuSpe //
I hope that I can get some answer.
Thank you
