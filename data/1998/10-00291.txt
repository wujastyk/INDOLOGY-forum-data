Excuse me for not giving all the details about English translations of the
Tattva Sandarbha (I don't keep all these books here at my office).  Please
note a third version by Swami B.V. Tripurari (which I have not personally
read but which has been commended to me and which is apparently in use in
some universities in the US):

the Gaudiya Sampradaya"

"Sri Tattva Sandarbha of Srila Jiva Goswami"
