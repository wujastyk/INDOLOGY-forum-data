Interested in Gaudiya Vaishnava literatures
Excuse me for not giving all the details about English translations of the
Tattva Sandarbha (I don't keep all these books here at my office).  Please
note a third version by Swami B.V. Tripurari (which I have not personally
read but which has been commended to me and which is apparently in use in
some universities in the US):

the Gaudiya Sampradaya"
