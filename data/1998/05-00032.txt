Origin of Konkan Brahmins?
There is the story in the Sahyadri Khanda about the origin of the
kokanasthas, it was discussed in the indology list. In short it is highly
offensive to the kokanasthas. May be it was invented to explain the
etymology of the community name Chitpavan. The peshwas tried their best to
snuff out any copies of the Sahyadri Khanda. Does some have informations
as  to what Sutras are followed by the chitpavans. Do most of them follow
the aashvalaayana sutra ?.  The sahyadri khanda also has a story of the
origin of the Gauda Saraswat coomunity which is again an atempt to
denigrate them.
