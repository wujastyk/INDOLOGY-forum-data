YogasUtra, Update
MA> In this connection: do some of you know what happened to the book by
MA> T.  Gelblum on Yoga Philosophy, planned as part of Fasc. 5 in the
MA> 6th vol. of Gonda's History of Indian Literature?. And now we are on
MA> that subject, what about the other missing parts (e.g. UpaniSads)?
In 1997, the publisher of the series, Harrassowitz in Wiesbaden,
informed us that the series is closed now. As I understand it, the
volumes or parts you are referring to will remain unpublished -- at
least as part of the series "History of Indian Literature".
