The Aryans (again); 19th century discourse.

This statement is the only comment I have encountered from Dayananda where

I wonder if he is referring to William Jones, who held this view.  Muller
simply held "somewhere in Asia."  Before a 'European homeland' was
promoted by Gordon Latham around 1860, most scholars held that the
'homeland' was in the Pamir/Bactria area.
You are right. Dayananda seems to use the term culturally, and racially.
But there is no reference to Western Indologists. He seems to be operating
and engaging in a context exclusively composed of Sanskrit texts with no
reference of other types of pramANa (except for the comment on Iran, that
you noted above).  Even his comment that the Aryans once ruled the world
doesn't attempt to coopt the implication of the IE language connection or
reverse the logic of the IE linguistic argument, so to speak.  It is
simply based on a literal reading of Mahabharata statements.  Vivekananda
and Aurobindo, on the other hand, seem much more up on what Western
critical scholars were doing.
The question I have, accordingly, is why did Dayananda use the word 'Arya'
for his Samaj?  Was it a term that came spontaneously to him from his own
reading of Sanskrit texts, or was he picking up on the Aryan debates
raging in Europe (to which I can find no reference in his works)?  Best,
