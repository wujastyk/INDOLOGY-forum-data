Manikyala
Some months ago there was a questions about the Manikyala stupa. In the
mean time I have found two of my slides showing the interior chamber of the
stupa (for the exterior views I am still searching...).
For those interested here is the WWW-Site:
http://www.thewalt.de/manik1.html and
http://www.thewalt.de/manik2.html .
But beware: the JPGs are rather voluminous: 104 and 230 KB respectively
(thats why I do not send them as attachments to all of the list).
I hope I can make some more photographs available soon.
