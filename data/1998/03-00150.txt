The Shiva Hypothesis (fwd)
I would like to thank Paliath Narendran for correcting me about the
origin of Petri nets and for providing the bibliography...I think that
the gentleman who I was refering to was Dr Thiagarajan and not
Balasubramaniam since the adds seems to match..I'm sorry for any
confusion that may have arisen out of this.
 I thank V.Rao Veluri for the correct derivation of Gangamycin
and would like to mention in the context of P.Cooper's comment that:
In the Grand Canyon, aren't there formations or mountains that have been
named after Vishnu and Brahma in addition to Siva? As usual, all
corrections are welcome.
Regards,
KRishna
