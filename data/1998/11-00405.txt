OCR of (transcribed) indic texts
I use an old version of the program RECOGNITA. Only this old one allows it
to change the recogn.fon-file. Using a programm to edit FON-files I could
change the model for the whole RECOGNITA programm. Now the programm can read
all Indian diacritics like N. M etc. The latest versions of RECOGNITA never
uses FON either TTF files, so it is never possible to use it for our
purposes. In any way the old RECOGNITA with the edited FON-file (that is the
model for the OCR process) works well, for example I am scanning at the
moment books like DIE LEHRE DER JAINAS from Schubring. It is not possible to
copy the  RECOGNITA programm. Search in the INTERNET for this company. Ask
for an old version with an editable FON-file (recogn.fon is the exact name).
You may also change this file in a way to read devanagari-manuscripts.
