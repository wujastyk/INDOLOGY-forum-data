Hi Dave,
We are getting a little far afield here, but as far as I can tell, The
Book of Mormon (which is similar in style to The Old Testament in King
James translation) does indeed purport to detail the history of a tribe
of Israel that migrated from Jerusalem to the New World in about 600
BCE, they were led by the prophet Lehi. Once they arrived in the New
World they migrated and split into 2 groups: the virtuous Nephites and
the sinful Lamanites.
Cheers,
Mary
