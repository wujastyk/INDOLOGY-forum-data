Indeed, that is what I just think to have find out
in several Prakrit stories:
The old Jamadagni went away from his strong tapas
to look for a wife, to get children. He went into
the maidens chamber of a king and
tAhiM daTThUNa nicchUDham
-- traditionally scholars use to make the
conjecture nicchUDham=nicchUDho
and translate: after the (maidens) had seen (the
old and ugly Jamadagni) they pushed him away
(nicchUDho).
I think in opposite to this there is no conjecture
necessary. The text is clear and correct, if we
think about the retrospect argument:
after the maidens had seen him they went away
(nicchUDham).
After I collected a list of all occurences of
similar expressions, it seems that in this Prakrit
sources the retrospect view is always formed as
neuter (ending -am)
