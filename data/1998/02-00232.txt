K. Mayo
Few years ago, browsed thru' a paper on K. Mayo. A feminist reading
saying that Katherine Mayo did not have freedom in 1920s to criticize
the American society. So, she chose India where social status of women
was bad.
In a collection of articles, within last 10 years. Must be from a
US univ., Wrote down the reference somewhere. Can anyone tell the
reference?
Thanks,
