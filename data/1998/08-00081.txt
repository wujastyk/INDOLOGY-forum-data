I'd like to know where exactly did you find these instances? In my opinion you are right in considering them awkward. cikiir.su.h and dudruu.u.h clearly sound more normal. It seems indeed a joke at the cost of Dattakala'sin's knowledge of grammar. Is there a reason in the context to do so? If not, I'm inclined to interpret them as typo's, but if these are the only serious typo's in the whole edition......
