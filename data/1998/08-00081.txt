ciciir.su.h and dudru.su.h
Vidyanath Rao wrote that he found these two words in the Padmaprabh.rtaka.
I'd like to know where exactly did you find these instances? In my opinion you are right in considering them awkward. cikiir.su.h and dudruu.u.h clearly sound more normal. It seems indeed a joke at the cost of Dattakala'sin's knowledge of grammar. Is there a reason in the context to do so? If not, I'm inclined to interpret them as typo's, but if these are the only serious typo's in the whole edition......
