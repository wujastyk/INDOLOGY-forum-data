Russian cars built for Siberia were better for cold climates. The
concept of the Greek trireme came from the Assyrian direme which was
an improvement over the single layer boats. To my mind the direme was
a bigger invention. After seeing two decks, thinking of 3 decks is not
hard. Adding extra spokes for rough riding over the steppes doesn't say
much about levels of technology. Cities had things like roads and it
was probably not necessary to have 10 spokes. This is like comparing a
jeep
4 wheel drive against a Maserati and concluding the jeep is more
advanced.

   Can I then understand that Sintashta chariots are
   more advanced than the Neareast variety??

   To make sense, Steppe-valas added more spokes.
   A technolgical advance.
   (For cities 4 would suffice; Steepes needed
   more)
