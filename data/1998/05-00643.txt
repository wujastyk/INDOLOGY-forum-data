Suffixes and abstractions
Thanks for the leads. It is interesting that suffix -tan ('stretch';
also 'self') tries to extend the semantic content of the susbtantive.
Suffixes -ikam, -tige seem to evolve an abstract thought. I am
thankful for the leads because I am struggling to understand further
the classifiers used in the linguistic area.
Regards,
k.
