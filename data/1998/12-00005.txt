SV: SV: SV: Is the Aryan Invasion a Myth?
ATTACHMENTS
I begin to see that the problem that has been bothering Jacob Baltuch in fact has been bothering the whole list. I am terribly sorry, but I'll contact the Microsoft User Group and see if they have a solution. I am honestly at a loss to understand what goes on.
I guess this will come with an attachment, too. Bear with a little while longer! Please.
Best regards,

Hi Lars,
Every time you post, I do get attachments.
Go to indology archives. There your attachments
are included as unreadable scribble.
Also, there are no return keystrokes of your
writeup. It is one long line.
The original writeup by someone and
your response to it are not clearly
demarcated.
Regards,
N. Ganesan
