A package called "Sanskrit for LaTeX" by Charles Wikner handles Vedic
accents, allows the user to choose between variant forms of several

available from CTAN (ftp://ftp.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/language/sanskrit/).
A compiled and patched DOS executable is available from my website at:

There are no more available positions in Velthuis's font, so nothing more
can be added to it.
