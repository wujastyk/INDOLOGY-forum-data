This is partly a simple question of terminology. Vedic Sanskrit is Sanskrit
in the same way that Homeric Greek is Greek. The point is that Vedic differs
from classical Skt. in a number of ways, both in terms of grammar and
vocabulary. But the difference is not so big that we could say that Vedic is
a different language altogether! As far as I can see, the difference between
Vedic and Classical Skt. is less than the difference between - say - avadhi
or braj on the one hand and khari boli on the other.
It is practical to have a term for Vedic Skt. Then we know what we are
referring to: the language of the four Vedas, the Brahmanas and the
classical Upanishads.
They are all correct! There is no contradiction.
