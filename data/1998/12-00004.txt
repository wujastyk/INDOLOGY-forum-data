Dear List Members,

Does anyone have a good translation for epic 'daivam'?

'Fate' or 'destiny' seem to be terms which have very little relation to
pre-classical kshatriya culture.

I am aware of Shulman's article in the Heesterman Festschrift, but that is
not conclusive.

Devaat Aagatam does not really help us too much in explaining what is
action for an epic kshatriya.

Thanks,


                                Kevin McGrath.
