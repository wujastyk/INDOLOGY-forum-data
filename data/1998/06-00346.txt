King Shahaji of Tanjore
Vidyasankar and Devesh have already provided some references...
in addition,  please take a look at the following books by
Prof.S.Seetha, Retired Head of Dept of Music, Madras University.
        -  Tanjore as a seat of music, during the 17th, 18th, and
        19th centuries.  University of Madras. 1981
        -  Raga Lakshanamu.  Brhaddhvani, Madras. 1990.
The second book is a Telugu treatise on music authored/attributed
to Shahaji Maharaja.  His descendant's (Tulaja I) Sanskrit treatise
on music Samgita SaaraamRta is very much indebted to his ancestor's
Telugu work.
