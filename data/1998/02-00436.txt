Multimedia Hindi
Here at Copenhagen University we would like to start a
teaching archive of multimedia resources for Hindi language.
Resources would  include the following:
1. Interactive CD ROM's
2. Videotapes
3. Satellite access to Hindi Language TV
4. Good Language Cassette Tapes
I should greatly appreciate any advice and suggestions about
materials and where to obtain them (esp. if there is a web
site).
Many thanks in advance,
Ken Zysk
