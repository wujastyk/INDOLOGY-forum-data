I am currently working on a project documenting the liturgical
music/dance traditions of the Tyagarajasvami Temple, Tiruvarur.
Siva-Tyagaraja was Sahaji's ista-devata, and was also the state deity
during his rule.  The following references may be of some use:

One tradition claims that the Tiyakecar Kuravanci, which was staged
regularly in the Tyagaraja temple, was composed by Sahaji himself.  He
is said to have written the text identifying himself with the heroine,
Rajamohini.  You may want to see the printed edition of the text:
