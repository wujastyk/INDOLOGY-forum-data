Subject: [Announce] New book by Wujastyk
Message-ID: <161227037663.23782.84563672829663342.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I'm pleased to be able to announce a new book:

Dominik Wujastyk, _The Roots of Ayurveda: Selections from Sanskrit
        Medical Writings_ (New Delhi: Penguin, 1998).
        Penguin Classics.
        ISBN 0-14-043680-4.  Rs. 250.

The book provides English translations of passages selected from the
classical works of ayurveda, including Caraka, Susruta, Vagbhata, Kasyapa,
Sarngadhara, and the Bower Manuscript, together with a historical
instroduciton. There is a bibliography and an index of Sanskrit and
English terms.

I published the book in India because I wanted to reach Indian readers
(which my last book, published in Holland, singularly failed to do).
However, it should be available through any bookstore in the world which
can order books from Penguin.  Use the ISBN when (if) requesting the book.

Best wishes,
Dominik
