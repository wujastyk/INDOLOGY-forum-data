Dear Indologists,
first of all I want to express my gratitude for the suggestions I
received regarding my earlier message. However the suggestions made were
rather frustrating as it seems that there is no way of obtaining mss.
from both libraries via mail. However I have had good experiences with
other libraries like Adyar in Madras, BORI in Poona or Asiatic Society
in Calcutta, to name a few. Hence my somewhat naive request to you.
        Some of you suggested that I should visit the libraries equipped with a
good 35 mm camera and b/w films. Although this is a good way of
documenting mss. I have been experimenting with colour slides as well,
which can be scanned with a photo-scanner and thereafter be processed
with programs like PaintShop etc. I have done this with paper and
palmleaf mss. and the results were very good, as you can also have a
coloured reproduction of the mss., which is sometimes helpful for a
detailed description of mss. (For instance if you have red lines in the
margin). Enlargement of difficult passages is also no problem. To put it
briefly: there are certain advantages which anyone who has some
expierence with mss. can easily imagine.
Thanks for reading and kind regards.
