help in sanskrit translation
Dear members
I have just completed the edition and translation of an
anthology of Sanskrit lyric poetry. I found three instances
where I was not able to translate the verses. I please
request the help of the learned members to read the following
and give me any suggestions. I should be very grateful if I
can get any help.
