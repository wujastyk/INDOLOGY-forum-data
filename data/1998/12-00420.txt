I'm not sure how Baltistan in Northern Pakistan is relevant.  I only
said that invaders into the Northwest (by which I meant horse-bound
nomadic invaders) do not cross directly over the Himalayas but through
passes.  Not that you can't trek through the Himalayas, it's just
impossible terrain for horses and wagons.
