Probably you can check the Jataka 547: Vessantara
is also sitting before his hut and wearing thuch a
thing. It is also shown in Sanchi. Vessantara, the
king, who gave all away, also his 2 childs and
finally his wife. Then Indra appeared and he got
all back. In the PTS-dictionary there you may find
sv paTTa the term AyogapaTTa.
Check please Coomarasvami, Bulletin of Madras
museum, s. v.: He seems to mention the term.
