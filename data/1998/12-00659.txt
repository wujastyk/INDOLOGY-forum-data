Something like Nostradamus text and a recent book that claims all kind of
historical events based by codes imagined by the author. You can interpret

fictional account which may have accidentally used some place names and
events as a crutch to the story line. The style of the story and its narration
in the first person is one of the clues that is was a book of fiction where the
author wanted to impress the listeners.
