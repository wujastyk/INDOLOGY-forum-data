e-journal for TamilStudies
friends,
here we are:
our new on-line journal for Tamil-Studies, called "KOLAM", is now
available
on our IITS web-site.
Just have a look at:
www.uni-koeln.de/phil-fak/indologie/kolam/kolam.html
still, a few extensions and additions will be carried out during the
following
week.
waiting for feedbacks...
                          The editors (Ulrike, Andreas, Sascha)
