                The next century would only start with 2001 A.D.
                As was the case with the 1st century A.D. which
        started with 1 A.D. and ended with 100 A.D.
                A century is 1-100 and a millenium is 1-1000.
                Ninty-nine runs don't make a century, do they?:-)
