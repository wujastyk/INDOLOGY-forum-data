Subject: Is the Aryan Invasion a Myth?
Message-ID: <161227042962.23782.18305523898069446646.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Is there any real evidence for Aryan invasion other than the theory one
German scholar who never visited India? I know there are lots of
postulations about the similarity of Sanskrit to European languages etc.
What I mean is there any real evidence like archeological evidence?
