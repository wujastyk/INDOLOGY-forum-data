Please, read Spruytte's ``Early Harness systems''.
Wooden axles, from suitable trees are durable enough.
I am not contesting that metal tools would be required.
I am just not convinced that they were lacking in the steppes,
whether imported or made locally or both.
Lack of fit was taken care of (again in Tut's chariot) by
having a long sleeve extend from the hub over the axle. In fact,
this is precisely why Littauer and Crowell reject the idea that
the Sintasha vehicle was a ``real'' chariot.
Also I doubt that casting a cyldrincal axle to the required
tightness or polishing metal axles is that easy.
May be someone can tell me the answers to the questions this thread
raises: What IE tree names are there in Indo-Iranian? Isn't Skt bhuurja
cognate to birch? If so, how long could PI-Ir speakers live in treeless
areas without losing that word? Anybody know references to pollen
studies or such that can tell us about the flora of 3rd-2nd m. BCE steppes?
