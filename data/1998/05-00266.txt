Well, there is certainly much in common between Altaic and Uralic. So
much so, that even Western scholars at one time considered them as
part of the same genetic family (many scholars particularly in the "Turanian
world" still do).  The early comparative linguists did not consider Uralic and IE
as even distant cousins.
For the record, I don't support any such theory, nor the AIT theory.
I believe the answer is much more complicated than any of these
arguments.
