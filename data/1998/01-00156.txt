Subject: Yiddish translation of Gita (?)

I think it is quite wonderful that someone had the inclination and
discipline to translate the Gita into Yiddish, a language that had a
relatively small but intellectually and religiously vibrant community of
speakers. This must have been a labor of love.

It perhaps seems curious because Yiddish was a language of a
predominately self-enclosed community, not noted for its curiosity about
Indian religious thought.

Some texts are translated into every arcane language imaginable, the
Book of Mormon seems to be out there in almost every known language,
including Esperanto.

 On a more frivolous note, if Winnie the Pooh can be translated into
Latin, why not the Gita into Yiddish?

The better question might be why there is hostility to the idea?
