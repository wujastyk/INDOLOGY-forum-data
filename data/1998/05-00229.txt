A number of friends have kindly contacted me to say that they are having
difficulty getting my book from local bookshops.  Apparently Penguin
outside India is not willing to supply Indian-published Penguin books
(I'd be glad to hear people's experiences in this area, especially
counter-examples.)

If you wish to order Indian Penguin books directly from the publishers in
India, you can send your requests
by email to
        penguin at del2.vsnl.net.in
or by fax to
        +91 11 623 4250 for

All the best,
Dominik
