Questions on word-final vowels in Sanskrit
One possibility to consider is that Sanskrit words passed into Tamil
through their somewhat Prakrit-like pronunciation.  In many Prakrits, the
nominative singular of Sanskrit (masc.) words in -a ends in -o.  This o
vowel is often reduced to u.  One can see this already in Buddhist Hybrid
Sanskrit continuing all the way into Old Marathi of JnAnezvar in the 13th
century A.D.
