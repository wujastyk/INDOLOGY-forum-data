Pardon me for repeating the following information.
But there are two existing solutions around this problem. One is to use
the ITRANS scheme which uses ordinary transliterations for encoding the
material. You don't need any fancy keystrokes. The Itranslator developed
by the folks at the Omkarananda Ashram will open two windows, let you type
ITRANS notation in one and see the output in another. Once created, the
devnagari file is fully portable. The site for this public domain utility
is:
 Omkarananda Ashram
If you are more used to word-type processing, then I recommend the simple
macros by John Richards also available in the same site. They don't need
ITRANS scheme, but you can type transliterated letters followed by a
control sequence to create ligatures. Both these solutions are for the
Windows' world! For unix etc. the ITRANS or TeX/LaTeX are still my
choices!

As a sample, let me illustrate how the sample

 is encoded in ITRANS. It is simply:
