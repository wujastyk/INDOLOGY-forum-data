 Dear Viktor,
  I very much share your concern  regarding the total lack of interest
in their own culture and heritage among a large percentage of Indians.
This malaise has been steadily eating into the society for the last
few decades and can be observed in every walk of life.  Right from areas
like movies and music (woeful lack of appreciation for classical music/
movies and music of an earlier period). In a way there are certain
factors which cause these indirectly... the breakdown of social values
brought about a peculiar convoluted idea of democracy + economy.. a
poor standard of living forces most people to drift towards things which
will help them acquire a better standard of living. As I often say this
seems to be the 'age of pygmies' when 'mediocrity is glorified as
excellence' in almost every field of human endeavour. When such is the
case field of indic studies and humanities as a whole has become the
first casuality of such an attitude among people. Though I am an research
scholar in aerospace engineering I take tremendous interest and spend
a lot of time learning things not related directly to my area of work
because of the sheer joy I finding in learning and appreciating those
things. The monetary usefulness of those things should be the last thing
in mind but well I guess reality seems to be different. Sorry for
rambling, but I just wanted to share my thoughts on these things which
are dear to my heart and on which I feel so strongly about.
