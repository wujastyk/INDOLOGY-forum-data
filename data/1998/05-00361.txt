Hello List-members again:

In my previous post requesting information on the prayojana of a treatise,
I erroneously stated that I was especially interested in the purpose of the
purpose (prayojanasya pryojanam). In fact, what I am more interested in are
debates concerning the purpose of *stating* the purpose
(prayojanakathanasya prayojanam). In other words, why is it necessary to
state the purpose at the beginning of a treatise?

Regards,
Sara McClintock
