Yes you're right, Cushitic was grouped together with Egyptian and Berber
as Hamitic and separate from Semitic.
I confused my arguments (need to slow down).  The separation of Egyptian
from close relationship with Cushitic was what I was getting at. There
are many reasons why this bears on the race problem, but the most
important is the question of the racial identity of the ancient
Egyptians. Another problem is the original "race" of the Afro-Asiatic
speakers.
