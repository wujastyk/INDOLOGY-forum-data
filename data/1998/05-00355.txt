I believe the point here is that the horse plays a central role in
Indo-European ritual, which is why we would expect to find it on the seals.
The reason why the bull is frequently represented on the seals may be that
it played a role in the Indus culture which it didn't play in Indo-European
culture. The camel may have played no significant part in the culture apart
from performing menial work.

But it goes without saying that all such interpretations are uncertain. We
simply do not have enough data to state emphatically that things are in a
certain way.
