I don't know exact numbers, but of the ten orders of daSanAmIs, at least
three have significant numbers of non-brAhmaNa monks. See histories
written by Jadunath Sarkar or Sadananda Giri, or the more comprehensive

Contingents of kshatriya monks used to be standard parts of most Rajput

The Ramakrishna orders, who are derived from the daSanAmIs in lineage,
have large numbers of non-brAhmaNa monks. In fact, Vivekananda, whose
name started this discusion, was himself a kshatriya by birth.
