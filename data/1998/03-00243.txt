Vaishesikasutra E-text
Better late than never:
we should be grateful to Prof. Masanobu that he made available an E-text of the
sUtra of Vaisheshika, this interesting orthodox Brahminical philosophical
school which accepted (just like the Buddhist logicians DiNnAga and
DharmakIrti), only direct perception and inference (pratyakSa and anumAna) as
the two main sources of valid knowledge (pramANas), sacred texts (Agama) having
validity only on the basis of these two.l
