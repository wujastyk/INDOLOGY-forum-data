Two national museums of Asian art in the USA -- the Freer Gallery of Art
and the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery, both part of the Smithsonian Institution
in Washington, D.C. -- recently have developed a set of web resources on
Hindu worship to complement the museum exhibition "Puja:  Expressions of
Hindu Devotion."

On the web is an online guide for educators that includes  include
information on Hindu deities, video footage of worship, lesson plans for
teachers, and proposed classroom activities for students.  A response form
is provided at the web site, and Smithsonian staff are requesting feedback
from scholars, teachers, students, and the general public.  The exhibit and
resources are intended to be accessible to younger as well as advanced
students.

The URL http://www.si.edu/asia/ opens to Sackler/Freer main page.  A
hyperlink to http://www.si.edu/asia/puja/start.htm takes one to the
beginning of the "Puja" online exhibit and the multi-part guide for educators.
