Comparing the posting of KIM it might be
interested to read a text written in Prakrit
daNDa-kavADe mantha-antare ya sAharaNayA
sarIra-tthe
bhAsA-joga-nirohe selesI sijjhaNA ceva
that is (in this context the Karman is a
material - dust, very small particles which are
influencing the soul. the process described in the
above stanzas says how it is possible to destroy
all these particles on the soul - as an
alternative to the long way of a monk)
"he in activating his body in sending his
Karman-influenced soul-particles in the form of a
staff (daNDa, that measures from the Zenith to the
Nadir - plus a kapaTa ("doorwing") on each side
(reaching to the end of the world in the
west/east) ... )thereby constructing the universal
form of a "Quirlstaff (mantha)" ... and finally he
contracts his soul-particles again which are now
free from any karmic particle."
In another more comprehensive describtion this
whole process is divided into four
time-quantities: four moments (samayas)
in the first samaya he ejects his karmic
soulparticles and forms a rUcaka-shaped daNDa
in the second samaya he makes the kapaTa
(doorwings)
in the third samaya he makes pratara
in the fourth samaya he contracts the
soulparticles again

This process is called samudghAta

Betreff: Karuna/metta sought


>Dear Netters,
>I wonder if any of the Buddhologists on the list
could exercise his/her
>karuna and metta
>and provide me with a textual reference to the
following extract:
>
>"In a recommended meditation exercise, the
meditator is asked to pervade the
>four directions
>successively with thought charged with
friendliness, compassion, sympathetic
>joy, and
>impartiality by considering all beings as one
considers oneself and by
>having thought that
>by being large, sublime, immesurable, generous,
and nonviolent, pervades the
>whole universe."
>Cited by Narayan Champawat, Buddha (Siddhartha
Gautama), in: Ian P. McGreal
>(ed.),  Great Thinkers of the Eastern World,
Harper Collins, New York 1995,
>p. 165.
>The wording doesn't sound very clear to me -
especially the part "by having
>thought that by being
>large... pervades" seems ambiguous in the
subject. Who or what "pervades the
>universe", the
>meditator or his thought? Maybe the Pali text
would sound better. Can
>anybody help?
>Gratefully Yours, J.F.
