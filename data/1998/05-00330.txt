that is (in this context the Karman is a
material - dust, very small particles which are
influencing the soul. the process described in the
above stanzas says how it is possible to destroy
all these particles on the soul - as an
alternative to the long way of a monk)
"he in activating his body in sending his
Karman-influenced soul-particles in the form of a
staff (daNDa, that measures from the Zenith to the
Nadir - plus a kapaTa ("doorwing") on each side
(reaching to the end of the world in the
west/east) ... )thereby constructing the universal
form of a "Quirlstaff (mantha)" ... and finally he
contracts his soul-particles again which are now
free from any karmic particle."
In another more comprehensive describtion this
whole process is divided into four
time-quantities: four moments (samayas)
in the first samaya he ejects his karmic
soulparticles and forms a rUcaka-shaped daNDa
in the second samaya he makes the kapaTa
(doorwings)
in the third samaya he makes pratara
in the fourth samaya he contracts the
soulparticles again
This process is called samudghAta
