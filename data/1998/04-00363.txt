Vishnu Purana on personal names
I have come across the folllowing slokas in viSNu purANa on "How a
person's name should be?"
nArthahInaM ca cAsastaM nApazabdayutaM tathA
nAmaGglyaM jugupsyaM vA nAma kuryAt samAkSaraM
nAtidIrghaM nAtihrasvaM nAtigurvakSarAnvitaM
sukhOccAryaM  tu tannAma kuryAd yatpravaNAkSaraM (3.10.10-11)
" you shoud give a name which is not meaningless,  not unacceptable,
not ungrammatical,  not inauspicious, non-revulsive, of balanced letters,
not very long, not very short, of not too many long (guru) letters,
easily prnounceable and of conquering letters(?)"
Gita Press edition gives "yatpravaNAkSaraM" = ending with
a hrasva.
Please do not try to point out that my name violates quite a few
of these rules. I know it!
regards,
sarma.
