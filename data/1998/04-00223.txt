Dear Dominique:
I noticed in the Sunday Newspapers today that your book The Roots of
Ayurveda is listed among the best sellers under the "non-fiction category".
Hearty congratulations!
        Thanks for sounding  a warning  to some honourable members bringing
in unwarranted political discourse into Indology which has no interest in
it. Best regards, Bh.K.
