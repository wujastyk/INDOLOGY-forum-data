Indo-Aryan migration vs Indigenous origin - scholarly debate
Miguel Carrasquer Vidal answer me:
        Undoubtly a simple and well-structured explanation. Alas, some
problems remain.
        Even writed *h3ekt-, *ok^t-os "4" don't fit well with *kwet- "4"
(the Greek tessares don't shows any prothesis in any dialect). The isolated
Avestan aSti- don't seems sufficient to postulate such a form.
        The analogy between h1, h2, h3 and k^, k, kw is oversimplifying
(and the last serie is dubious). It's true that a labial feature is
probable in h3 and used for a reconstruction *h3ekteh3 "8" (a voiced form
of h3 being useful to explain the Greek ordinal ogdowos) but that's not
sure that h3 is necessary to explain the direct animated thematic dual case
which could be -oh1(w) (see the common vedic dual forms in -A). I'm afraid
that all such choice are uniquely made to link aSti and aSTau and we can't
exclude the fact that, even if they are linked, aSti could be derived from
an aSTau falsely interpreted (such inverse derivations are well known in
linguistic).
        Not lurking but too few facts to decide ;^(
