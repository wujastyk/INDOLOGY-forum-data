I do not know why potters should be considered "undeserving hosts". J.
A.
Schoterman says, "Being the offspring of an illicit union of a Brahmin
and a
Vaizya-female (Kane II-1: 78) they are regarded as bhojyAnnas, i.e.,
food
prepared by them could be paratken by Brahmins (Kane
II-1:122)".(SaTsAhasra
saMhitA, p. 8)  Note however that the marriage is still anuloma.

On the other hand, I think what the mahAbhArata story reveals is a rare
glimpse of what the society really had been instead of what the
brahminic
authors usually wanted it to be. It will be a mistake to rely on the
status
of castes as propounded by brahmanic law-givers.
