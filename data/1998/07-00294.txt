Converting Devanagari
Hello Folks !
I?ve got some problems using the programm "devawin" which is connected with the TTF "Balaram" in some way.
The man who gave this package to me said that I must type the "Balaram" with diacritics and "DevaWin" is able to convert the whole into nagari via clipboard.
The Problem is that I can?t find any diacricitca within "Balaram".
Can anybody solve this problem ?
Greetings,
Daniel Stender
