Indian children born abroad -- some (more) clarifications
"Then and then alone you are Hindu when the distress of anyone bearing that
name comes to your heart and makes you feel as if your own son were in
distress."
This was said by Swami Vivekananda in one of his lectures printed in the
book "Lectures from Colombo to Almora". Swami Vivekananda is considered an
ideal freedom fighter. In fact, there have been several bauddhiks
(spiritual discourses) wherein time and again it is emphasized Ramakrishna
Paramhamsa, Swami Vivekananda and Guru Aurobindo Ghosh have been
instrumental in the re-awakening of the spiritual theme of dharma that
flows through India. In fact the word Hindutva itself is defined as the
"defence of Dharma". This is no sham as might be pointed out later by some.
The RSS actually inculcates these values through its branches and camps.

Yes, this is what Ramakrishna Paramahansa or Sri Chaitanya taught us. We
only hope the saffron brigade of "Hindutva" (i.e., a distorted and
exclusionary version of Hinduism) followed them.
