This is an excellent question...
What is also most interesting is Tacitus in the Germania states that the
Germanic tribes in their ancient ballads trace their origin to
Mannus(Manu) the son of god Tvisto (Tvastr)!!.
Does anyone know which Manu was the son of Tvastr ? (5th or 6th??)
What is also fascinating is the presence of the Germanic
Chatti (Khatti?) tribe.
It is possible that the Guti and the Massagetae are the remnants
of the various Khatti tribes. The Massagetae being the Maha Khatti.
