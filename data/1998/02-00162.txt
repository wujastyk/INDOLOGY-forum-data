Even the Central Board of Secondary Education, which offers the largest
number of choices in languages for high school students, including
Tibetan, does not offer Latin or Greek. I have not heard of such
courses even in the Madras University. In general, humanities studies
get little attention because they are not very remunerative. Sad, but
true. I guess after the British left India, no one would have bothered
about the classical European Languages.
