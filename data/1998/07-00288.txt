Subject: Seeking Vallabhite Text
Message-ID: <161227041024.23782.11353993497612535015.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I'm desperately looking for a copy of the following text by
Purusottama (18th cent.), the Vallabhite acarya:

PuruSottama.  avatAravAdAvalI.  Ed. by H. O. Shastri.  Bombay, 1928.

Interlibrary loan and internet searches have turned up nothing.  If
anyone can help me locate this or any other edition, I'd be very
greatful indeed.

Thanks, Lance
