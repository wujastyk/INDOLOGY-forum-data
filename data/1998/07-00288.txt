Seeking Vallabhite Text
I'm desperately looking for a copy of the following text by
Purusottama (18th cent.), the Vallabhite acarya:
PuruSottama.  avatAravAdAvalI.  Ed. by H. O. Shastri.  Bombay, 1928.
Interlibrary loan and internet searches have turned up nothing.  If
anyone can help me locate this or any other edition, I'd be very
greatful indeed.
Thanks, Lance
