Altaic-speaking, yes.  So are the Turks of Turkey.  So are the Yakut

And I agree that such an idea is false.  IEans have no monopoly on
horses.  FYI, neither do Altaic peoples.
"Compendium linguarum iranicarum", ed. R. Schmitt, Wiesbaden 1989 (E,
F and G) gives a description of all Iranian lgs.
So whose language was it then?  It is found only in the Tarim basin,
and while there is evidence that Toch. A was not a living language
anymore at the time of our documents, there is every reason to assume
Tocharian B was the living language of the city of Kucha.
And how do you explain Ossetic and Yaghnobi?
You wish.
Yes, Uralic and Altaic (or Uralic, Turkic and Altaic, if one prefers)
are probably Nostratic languages, along with a few others.  There is
sufficient evidence for that, I think, although much work still needs
to be done.
Proto-World is nonsense, linguistically, but considering that its
proponents claim it was spoken in Sub-Saharan Africa 50-100,000 years
ago, and spread out from there all over the world, I can see what's
"great", but I don't quite see what's so "white" about it.
