Urdu speakers
Dear Sama Abbas,
I comment on your post at the relevant places. Perhaps there are other
scholars who would like to contribute to this thread, as I do not have time
to pursue it at length.
Please give me the names of the texts in Zaban-e-Urdu written by Mahmud of
Ghazi so that I may take a look at them. To the best of my knowledge the
only texts earlier than Amir Khusrau are Nath texts in Saddhukari. If texts
by Mahmud of Ghazni exist, I suspect they would be in Persian, as this was
the language used by the various Muslim conquerors until the end of the
Mughal Empire. A Persian text does not prove than the language of Ghazni is
the same as Old Urdu.
We must have more than a reference to a name, as Zaban-e-Urdu mnerely means
"language of the camp" and does not carry any linguistic information. In
which text is this reference, and does the text supply any samples of the
speech of "Zaban-e-Urdu"?
The term "Sanskrit-centric Brahmanical fundamentalist scholars" could
hardly be applied to scholars like Abdul Haq and Inshaullah Khan and many
other serious scholars who have worked on Urdu. Please supply the names of
the scholars whose work you rely on.
I leave comment on this above to my Sanskritist colleagues!
We cannot throw out the principles of historical linguistics before we even
begin our analysis. Several hundred years of historical research on many
language families of the world have shown that we can still determine the
grammatical and phonological basis of a language even when it has borrowed
heavily and become, from the lexical standpoint, a mixed language.
Khari Boli was an important element in the devotional poetry of the (then)
northen India, including modern Pakistan, so we know that it existed. The
various Muslim courts as I mentioned used Persian (we have enormous numbers
of records to prove it). They distinguished between this Persian and the
languages of India, which they lumped together and did not consider fit for
poetry.
Mir and Sauda are anything but linguistic reformers! Read their poetry, it
is full of complaints about the dark days which had fallen on the Mughal
Empire. Read Mir's memoirs.
It doesn't indicate anything except the geographical location of the
language. I can point out to you at least a dozen separate languages called
"Kohistani" (of the mountains) in Pakistan. Knowing that they are "of the
mountains tells us nothing, which we can find out by recording the
languages.
In short, you have brought many opinions for consideration, but you have
not furnished names of scholars, names of texts, quotations from the text
that contain more than the mere mention of the names of languages, or any
of the other data which are indispensable for linguistic and textual
analysis. I invite you to do so.
With best wishes,
Ruth Schmidt
