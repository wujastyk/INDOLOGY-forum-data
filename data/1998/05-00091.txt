The Indian village/district/state census material is availbable on disk
(and for all I know on a website).  It would be a rather easy job to
extract the names from the statistical data.  I have done so for my own
use in the case of certain districts of Karnataka and AP.  It took me a
couple of days (partly to write a program, partly to figure out data set
what I wanted)
