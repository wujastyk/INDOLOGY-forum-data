Velthuis' Devanagari 1.5 for TeX on Macintosh
At one point, the Velthuis preprocessor could not handle
the TAB character. Make sure all TABs are removed and
spaces inserted instead. This is a serious bug that probably
never got fixed.
This is the only thing I can say without actually looking
at your manuscript.
