Horses/Indus seals
Dr. Lars Fosse writes:
The bull is frequently represented in Indus seals. Does it
have anything to do with the Nandi vaahana of "Siva in later Hinduism?
Have seen in articles that "Siva is largely pre-vedic and
pre-Aryan.

Forgot to ask earlier:
Is the tripura dahanam episode in "Siva's myth, a development
from Vedic Indra & so on. When many of Indra's qualities
become "Siva's attributes, this also gets transferred??
Interesting that "Siva only smiles at the three puri/purams.
Prof. F. C. Southworth has indicated 'puri' is Dravidian.

Vedic folks sought many (100,000?) cows. Have seen that even the universe is
born out of a Cow. gOdaana is important in dharmasaastras. Is there any link of
cows largely, but NOT bulls, to vedic material?
Thoughts, corrections welcome.
