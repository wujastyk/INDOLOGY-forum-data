Dear Viktor:
I heard about a center (through a friend of mine) which is attempting
to increase both the written and oral study of Sanskrit in India. The
address is as follows.
73/2 Ranga Rao Road
Sankarapuram
Bangalore 560004
Phone: 0812-623-189
The person in charge used to be Krishna Sastry.
Hope this helps,
Lynken Ghose

P.S. There are also centers for the study of Sanskrit at Thol (?sp)
College in Calcutta, although I am not sure if the pandits there
speak English, and in many other places in India, such as Poona, as
was previously  mentioned, and Sarnath (near Varanasi).
