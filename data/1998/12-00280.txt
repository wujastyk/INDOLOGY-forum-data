"The history of the translation into Chinese of the many
different parts of this voluminous sUtra is extremely
complicated and cannot be reviewed in detail here. The
GaNDavyUha in all probability dates back to the first
centuries of our era. The text is probably of
South Indian origin. The starting-point of Sudhana's
pilgrimage lies in the South and the sages of the South
play a most important role in it. Some of the nonfictional
place names mentioned in the text can be localized
in the South."

'Siva, Avalokite'svara, Southern connections are brought
out in the GaNDavyUha beautifully. This text is 2-3rd
centuries AD. Much before KumarajIva or Hsuan Tsang.

In South India (dakSiNApatha), more than 10 places
are told as places of kalyaaNamitras (Sudhana's "good friends").
The kalyaaNamitra just before the last one in South India
is Avalokitezvara. Immediately after Avalokitezvara's
home Potalaka, Sudhana goes to the next Kalyanamitra site,
the last Southern site mentined in GaNDavyUha.
This kalyaaNamitra situated in the final, last
Southern site whom Sudhana meets is Mahadeva.

After meeting Avalokitezvara, and then Mahadeva
in their homes, Sudhana goes back to BodhimaNDa,
the home of historic Buddha.

GaNDavyUha narrates the residences of
Avalokitezvara and Mahadeva ('Siva) next to
each other and as a concluding segment of
the Southern pilgrimage. And, this is quite
significant.

May be this grand ultimate placement in GaNDavyUha gives us an
indirect hint of the importance of 'Saivism, the role of 'Siva
in South India, coalescing of Avalokitezvara and 'Siva
