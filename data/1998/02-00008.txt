Many thanks to Madhav Deshpande for classical references to the gosava
rite. What he has not mentioned, and what I am particularly interested in,
is that the rite is said to involve incest. This of course is what the
Buddhists (e.g. Vasubandhu and Yasomitra) find useful in attacking the
Brahmanical position. Has any scholar studied especially this aspect of the
rite?
