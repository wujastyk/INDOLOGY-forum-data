Gurmukhi Alphabetic Order?
                                       Thursday, March 19, 1998
Could someone tell my why in the Gurmukhi script 'sa' and 'ha' come
before 'ka' instead at the end as with other Brahmi based scripts? I do not
plan to interfile Panjabi with other scripts soon; it's just an anomaly
I'd like to understand if possible.  Thank you.
