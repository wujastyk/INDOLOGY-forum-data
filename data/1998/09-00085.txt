Indus Script -- sort of far off the point now
S. Krishna replied to Jonathan Silk:
....
D.D. Kosambi did not *bash* the artistic merit of the verses in the
collection.  Here is the final paragraph of section 8 of his introduction
to the edition:
"If these authors dealt with no major problem of the individual spirit, if
they strove neither to burn with a hard gem-like flame nor to free humanity
from any of the shackles man has imposed upon himself in making his own
history, time has exacted full penalty for the failrue. Most of their works
and all their biography have been gathered to an oblivion that makes future
restoration extremely doubtful. The poetry strive to be and is, at best,
exquisite rather than great. Yet, though the voice be thin, it is clear.
The field might be limited as to objectives, vision, or endeavor, but
excess is rare. The poets speak across the centuries in refined musical
tones bearing a soft but indelible charm, visualising an elegant life. The
dominant ideal, frankly expressed, is tasteful though not placid lovemaking
in luxury -- without vice, greed, brutal lust after blood, bourgeois
concentration upon money-breeding profit. It is only fitting that their
names and verses should not altogether be forgotten."
