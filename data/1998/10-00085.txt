SV: SV: [Re: On substratum religion]
  I would argue, in fact, that it is not misguided, but a
categorical imperative to view the "substrate" idea as the apposite of
Aryan Romanticism.  This does not mean that substrates do not exist. 
You lost me here. Somehow, this appears to be a contradictio in adjecto.
 But
we have to be careful and not use them as a kind of compost pile in which
all things that seem not to fit into the dominant, recorded culture are
heaped.
Here I follow you. You may always assume that substrates are at play when there are things you cannot explain in the normal manner, but such assumptions have little argumentative value. You have to give compelling reasons for assuming a substrate influence.
