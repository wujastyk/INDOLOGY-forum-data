Dear Dr. Chevillard,
Have a good trip to India. Please meet with Prof. S. N. Kandasamy
at Thanjavur and it will be useful. He has written extensively on
SVP's datings.
After 1974, many tamil brahmi inscriptions including
that of AtiyamAn have been found. I. Mahadevan has written an
overview called Early Tamil paleography. That book is
in print from IAS, Madras.
BTW, George Hart has completed the entire puRanAnURu translation.
It will come out from Columbia university press.
Regards,
N. Ganesan
