I will be happy to respond to the poll. I am a Tamil member with
background education in sanskrit, telugu, kannada, tamil, french and
hindi. My telugu teacher discussing Po_tana's poetry, told me of these
derivations 45 years ago.

Other than this, I have no comments on the s', c, y problem.

Regards,
