Inscriptions and Dravidian sound changes "y" > "c" and "y" >

I will be happy to respond to the poll. I am a Tamil member with
background education in sanskrit, telugu, kannada, tamil, french and
hindi. My telugu teacher discussing Po_tana's poetry, told me of these
derivations 45 years ago.
Other than this, I have no comments on the s', c, y problem.
Regards,
k.
