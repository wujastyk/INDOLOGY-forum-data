Indo-Aryan invasion
        I agree with the facts, but don't believe that's a counterexample,
just an other case. And an other problem is open:
        If the onomastic of Northern India gives us only an IA layer, it
seems there are just three explanations:
        - autochthony, the habitants are born from the Earth.
        - when they come, the land is free of people, uninhabited.
        - at some time, a strong (administrative?) power cause a whole
renaming of places. For peoples, religious causes can be evoked (see
Cassius Clay), many anthroponyms containing a God's name.
        Do you have some preference? or knowledge of a fourth way?
