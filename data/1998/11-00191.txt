Pointer to CFV: soc.history.early-modern
The Call For Votes (CFV) for the proposed Usenet group
soc.history.early-modern has been issued. If you are interested in the
creation of this group then please read the CFV and cast a vote, for or
against the proposed group, as you prefer.
The CFV has been posted to the Usenet group news.announce.newgroups and
crossposted to: news.groups, humanities.lit.authors.shakespeare,
rec.music.early, soc.history, soc.history.medieval,
soc.history.war.us-revolution, and soc.history.moderated. If you would
like to vote, then please access the CFV through one of these
newsgroups. It is NOT recommended that you vote from an archiving
service such as Dejanews - the formatting often results in a ballot
being invalidated.
Please remember that:
- It is a violation of the rules to try to influence the vote by
campaigning either for or against the proposal
- It is a violation to forward copies of the CFV to others. Only an
original ballot sent by the votetaker will be considered valid. If you
wish to inform others of the vote, please send them a pointer to the
CFV, not the CFV itself.
Voting will conclude on November 23, 1998.
Thank you.
