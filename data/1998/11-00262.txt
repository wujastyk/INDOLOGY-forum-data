I believe that last time I was in contact with Dominique, she was a man.
What has happened?
Dear Dominique --- I am terribly embarrassed.
The mistake is exclusively mine, not M. Hubey's.
It only shows that:
1) I tend to rely too much on analogies (always feminine: Veronique, Monique);
2) Dtto on my own language's feeling for gender (Dominik-Dominika).
It's obvious now that I need to go deeper into your language - which I take
on as a self-appointed task.
I do hope you accept my apology.
