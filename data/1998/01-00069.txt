Uttara Kuru

This is not entirely true. In Greek and Latin sources Uttarakuru is rendered Ottorokora (and
variants). In the Geography of Ptolemy Ottorokora is a city, Ottorokoras is a river and
Ottorokorai a people, all of them situated in the southern part of Serike. Serike, which is
definitely not China as is often thought, included not only extensive parts of Central Asia
including Tibet, but very probably also Assam and adjacent areas.
The Attacori of Pliny might also refer to the Uttarakuru people and are explicitly identified
by him with the Hyperboraeans. His description of their country as a valley secluded by
mountains and enjoying a beneficial climate (like the Hyperboreans) as well as the rest of his
geographical indications seem to me to point in the direction of Assam.
