What about the literal translation of 2)-like construction:
A''. The tank was filled with water by me.
This is also the typical construction in Sanskrit, according to
Macdonnel (Vedic Gr. for students) and Speyer. The ta.n.niiraati(?)
(should it be -.t.ti or ta.n.niiraikko.n.du or some such) seems to
be due to the desire to avoid two instrumentals in one sentence.
[Does double use of a single case in one sentence occur in Dravidian?
It seems to be rare to absent in Modern Tamil.]
