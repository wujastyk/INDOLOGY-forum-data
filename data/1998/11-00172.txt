The theories of demic diffusion reach their extreme in the example of
the Kennewick Man controversy.  A lot of this is just old "Aryan"
diffusionist theory in new packaging.
I'm referring to cultural superiority, although I'm don't think I agree
with your analysis of Western academic standards.  Either way, that
would not excuse bias in scholarship.  Try reading Schlesinger's _The
Disuniting of America_, which claims that Eurocentrism is not so bad
after all since the superiority of Western value systems if manifest.
Try G.K. Chesterton's _Eugenics and Other Evils_.  Barry Mehler is an
active writer on eugenics at the present.  The very existence of terms
like "racial hygiene" and "race betterment" in eugenics literature
illustrates the importance of race.
