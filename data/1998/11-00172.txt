Well at the risk of annoying Miguel and others, the Nostratic theory
and Greenberg's new theories (which demolish his old classification).
The theories of demic diffusion reach their extreme in the example of
the Kennewick Man controversy.  A lot of this is just old "Aryan"
diffusionist theory in new packaging.

I'm referring to cultural superiority, although I'm don't think I agree
with your analysis of Western academic standards.  Either way, that
would not excuse bias in scholarship.  Try reading Schlesinger's _The
Disuniting of America_, which claims that Eurocentrism is not so bad
after all since the superiority of Western value systems if manifest.

Try G.K. Chesterton's _Eugenics and Other Evils_.  Barry Mehler is an
active writer on eugenics at the present.  The very existence of terms
like "racial hygiene" and "race betterment" in eugenics literature
illustrates the importance of race.
