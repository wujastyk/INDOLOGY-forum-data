Vitthala, Pundalika and Panduranga
To this bibliographie suggested by Prof. Filliozat, I can note the following:
A important author on the Purandhradasa literature is Karmarkar A.P.,
Mystic Teachings of the Haridasa of Karnataka, Dharwar, 1939; The Puranic
Anthology, Belgaum, 1955.
Another important work: Ranade R.D., Pathway to God in Kannada Literature,
Poona,1958. Consult also:
Aiyangar S.K., Early Histroy of Vaishnavism in South India, Madras, 1920.
Bhandarkar R.G., Vaisnavism, saivism and minor religious systems, Varanasi,
Motilal,1965 (reprint of Strasbourg, 1913).
The Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan (Bombay) has also published books and booklets
on Purnadharadasa. Unfortunately I do not have the references here with me.
Needless to say that much of the material is found only in Kannada,
particularly the Kirtans of Purandharadasa which are sung by all Karnatic
musicians and in the homes of devout vaishnavaites  in Karnataka and also
in Maharashtra. Bookshops in Mysore,Bangalore and Dharwar/Hubli have a
number of popular kannada editions. The lyrics are powerful and worth
studying and made known in the West. I wish you all well in your research.
Contact me if you have aproblems with the Kannada texts. Anand Nayak.
