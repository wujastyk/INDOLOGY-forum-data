indrAdayaH surAH
Dear Indologists,
        I've found in MMW dictionary, under Adi, the syntagm indrAdayaH
surAH (without any reference). But it seems to me that, in the Rg veda, the
lists of Gods begin more frequently by vAyu than by indra. Even in the
mahAbhArata, arjuna is a third son. What could be a list of Gods begining
by indra? it's a canonical gaNa? from which text?
        I'd like to be enlightened.
