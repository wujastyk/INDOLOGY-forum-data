Is the Aryan Invasion a Myth?

I guess you have to ask Diakoff, and Denise Schmand-Bessarat. Like in
all
science, they seem to have noticed patterns in the world's languages
in which the bigger numbers are derived from the smaller numbers like
one-passed-one, one-passed-two, one-passed-three. If these distinguished
scientists (!) have come to the conclusion that the lower numerals as
seen
in the written record of the Middle East were being "invented" from even
smaller ones, then it is strange that a bunch of cattle-herders (that is
what the IE theory says) already could count up to 100 (in the decimal
system too, amazing) millennia before that. One of these is likely
wrong.
It's not necessary to use nails. But the outside rim (that goes on the
spokes) is held together by metal. Otherwise it would fall apart.
Besides, you are not suggesting that these great wheel-makers skipped
all the middle-levels in the then high-technology of wheel-making and
went right to spoked-wheels, are you? Or are you saying that the Vedic
wheels were a culmination of many years of wheel-making experience
and experiment starting a long time ago before the metals age possibly?
That is interesting. But South Urals are not the Ukrainian steppes.
Secondly,
perhaps you can tell us how the age of metal-making is known so well.
It surprises me that if dating the age of metal making was so easy we
should
then have a good chronology of where the iron age started and the bronze
age too while we are at it.
PS. Is this copper, bronze, or iron? What kinds of evidence is there? Is
it
mines? What kind of mines? copper? tin? zinc? iron? How is the age
dated?
Unless I am mistaken, often numbers are just invented by linguists. Most
of
them who give the age of IE to be 6,000 do not know where it came from.
It is not much more than fear by most to oppose the vocal few.
The illiterate IE bums is part of IE theory, according to its staunch
defenders. They do not have writing until Hittites which was borrowed
from
the Middle East. And the IE bums' "have horse, will travel" theory is
also
part of IE theory defended by most IEanists. Since the IE bums'
miraculous
invention of horse-riding and cart-making no other nomads seem to have
been very literate so it is unlikely that the IE bums were literate
either.
What is amazing is why a bunch of cattle-herders would be digging the
ground
for anything at all unless they already knew something about metallurgy.
So maybe humans knew a lot more about metals very long ago which is not
factored into the theories, or else it is unlikely that cattle-herders
discovered metals or worked them or knew how, unless some wandering
tribesmen from an area which already knew metalworking wandered into the
area and taught them.
Yes, I should have guessed. They could not have borrowed anything. I
guess
it is also not true that until the Mongols brought the cabbage to
Europe,
and before potatoes came from the new world, borscht was made with beets
only.
Tanenbaum has a nice saying; "if you don't like this year's standards,
wait
until next year; there will be plenty more." That is the great thing
about
the social scientists,; they are so sure of things that they have been
taught
to memorize while they were in school that they think "argument by
repetetion" is one of the axioms of logic. If some of them knew how to
think
(and some do, unfortunately not you) they would know that most of these
"theories" are based on two things: (1) unbridled imagination, (2) mass
repetetion of childhood memorizations.
If you repeat something enough times, and teach enough people to repeat
it,
it becomes "true" by virtue of repetition. This is why some people
outside of
Europe have realized that they can do the same thing; all they have to
do is
to teach their peoples to repeat the opposite things. Fortunately, there
are
still sane voices who are interested in truth and look for it.
Best Regards,
Mark
