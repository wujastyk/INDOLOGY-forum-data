Indian Army study of Persian in 20th c.
The encouragement of Persian skills along with Hindustani skills was
typical of the 19th century. Could this have been some bureaucratic glitch
- a clause in the jobscope for privates that was just kept on the books
past its expiration date (possibly with an eye on events in Afghanistan)?
