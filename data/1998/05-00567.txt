I don't understand why you take so much trouble to repeat my own statement.
Please reread my posting and you will see that I posited Iranian *aivaka- and NOT
Iranian *aika- as you seem to think.
This argument is merely based on the untenable supposition that the Vedic Aryans
were the only Aryans. It may be as I have said an archaism of certain Aryan
groups. On the other hand Mitanni-Aryan in satta- not only retains s, which
changed to h in Iranian, but shows assimilation of the consonant group which is
indeed a common linguistic feature as Vassilkov wrote, but would be nearly
impossible for reconstructed IIr.
I know perfectly well all what you are saying here and I need no intros. You did
not get my point at all. I only wanted to contrast one type of selective
argumentation to another (which is not necesssarily my own) in order to show that
there is no base for such definitive conclusions as you are drawing at the moment.
