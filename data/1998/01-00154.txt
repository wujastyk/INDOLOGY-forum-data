Vedic sacrifice

In Bhagavad-gItA 9.26, Lord KRSNa recommends offering a leaf, flower, fruit,
or water (toyam) to Him in devotion.  Consequently, in KRSNa temples, the
KRSNa Deity is offered water with His meals several times a day, and in
addition, on the altar there is covered container of water near Him, usually
to His right side.
It is also the disappearance anniversary of GauDIya VaiSNava saint, Locana DAsa
ThAkura, who wrote celebrated devotional songs.
I hope this is of some help.
