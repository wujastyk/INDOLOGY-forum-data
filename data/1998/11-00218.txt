Sanskrit plays on European stages
Dear Indologists,
I would like to know whether classical Sanskrit plays
have ever been staged in European theaters
during the past two centuries and whether it was a success.
I know of course that some plays have been
translated into european tongues
but I have been wondering whether some of these
had reached the general public.
Thanks for any hint
P.S. I am not talking about performances
like Peter Brook's Mahabharata, but about
traditional plays.
