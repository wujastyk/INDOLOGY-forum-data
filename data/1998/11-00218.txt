Subject: Sanskrit plays on European stages
Message-ID: <161227042529.23782.9023064283062432479.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear Indologists,

I would like to know whether classical Sanskrit plays
have ever been staged in European theaters
during the past two centuries and whether it was a success.

I know of course that some plays have been
translated into european tongues
but I have been wondering whether some of these
had reached the general public.

Thanks for any hint

P.S. I am not talking about performances
like Peter Brook's Mahabharata, but about
traditional plays.
