Indian children born abroad -- some (more) clarifications

As I mentioned already (in response to one of your repeated
self-advertisements of your book), I haven't read your book - and I
probably never will - but this is the information age.
If you need references, here is a URL of all your posts on USENET:

In it, there are about four HUNDRED articles from you that do nothing
but monger hate against a variety of organizations, including the RSS
and VHP.
I have no wish to engage you in a discussion regarding your
"philosophies". The only philosophy you sem to have exhibited in your
posts is "spread hatred about everything right-wing". That philosophy
merits no discussion.

Been there, done that. And no - it didn't take us 15 years to realize
what it means. Is it a coincidence that you are Bengali, and one of
the only states in India to vote for communist parties is West Bengal?
I visited Calcutta lately, and I was shocked to see it's state - the
red colored buildings, the utter poverty, and trams that move slower
than I can walk, merely because no one has the power to dismantle them
out of fear for the "labor" organizations. I also visited Russia
lately. Thanks, I have made my conclusions on this issue.
Once upon a time you were a RSS member. 15 years later you made a
complete volte face, and have dedicated your life to hate-mongering
about it. Who knows, 15 years from now, you will start hate-mongering
about the dead left-wing stuff you so passionately advocate now. I
think I'll just wait it out. :-)

I am very sad to say this, but the only thing that is hate-mongering
in all of this is you, Mr. Banerjee - for the past several years, you
seem to have dedicated your life to mongering hate about these
organizations. You seem to have little to contribute in the positive
direction.
As I mentioned earlier, if you think these organizations are so evil,
why don't you channel your energy in the positive direction and start
a "good social organization"? After all your presumptious statements
about almost everything to do with Indian society,  it seems like you
would be able to compete with them effectively, right ? :-)
Oh I'm sure it does. It must wax eloquently about the evils of
Hinduism. Do you have any references to the repeated genocides of the
Hindu people over the centuries ? Oh I forgot. That was just another
rumor started by the RSS, and millions of Hindus are just too stupid
to know otherwise. You are the only intelligent person around that
knows that the RSS is the root cause of everything that has gone wrong
with India.
Why don't you talk about what you would like to do, rather than just
sling mud on other people ? Is that what Marx taught you ? Is that
what the collapse of every left-wing political/religious organization
has taught you ? To send four HUNDRED hate-mongering posts on USENET,
many more on other mailing lists, and now to start the same thing on a
respected list like Indology ?
Probably, they are too busy doing "real work"? Where is the temple
your left-wing cronies built ?  Please let me know the address, and I
will surely visit it. Oh you don't have one ? Okay, I think I'll stick
to the VHP temple, thanks. Do let us know when your temple is ready,
though.
Have you even considered the fact that I might be one of them ? :-)
Jeez.
