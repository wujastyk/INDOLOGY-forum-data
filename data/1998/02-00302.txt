negations and their names
Only an incidental remark: I have found the expression
paryudaasapratis.edha listed both in the word index of Kajiyama's
translation of Moks.aakaragupta's Bauddhatarkabhaas.ya and in the termini
index of M.T.Much' edition and German translation of Dharmakiirti's
Vaadanyaaya. However, when I checked the pages referred to there I found no
direct reference to specific texts. Even in the lengthy excursus on
negation in Arcat.a's commentary on the Hetubindu the expression does not
occur.
