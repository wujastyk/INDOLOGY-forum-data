 Man, No. 4: p. 553-572.

As you can see there's a lot of literature in the anthropological field.
I found the readings above all very interesting and enlightening, there
is more but unfortunately I don't have my papers at hand.
George Michell's book is a primer and a must for anybody interested in
Indian Temple architecture.
It should be available in various translations.
