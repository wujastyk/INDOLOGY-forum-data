You have made a wild accusation. Please, substantiate what you have said.
The number postings about Tamil you have made and the number of times
I responded and how many times it is about Tamil.
Just look back. I would like to refresh your memory about the irrational
outburst of one of the tamil members of this list when Microsoft
announced introduction Devanagari fonts for Word. The shoe is on the other
foot.

sarma.
