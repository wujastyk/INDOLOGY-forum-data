Uttara Kuru
        Why not ?
        But the myths and rumors about "Lost Happy Valleys", Shangri-La,
Eden, Ultimate Thule, Eldorado, &c. are very common ones and I'm not sure
the sources of Ptolemy and Pliny were verified ones. Their conception of
the Geography was not the our own ;-)
        Without archeological or textual evidence, an identification with
any real place is nothing but a gamble (but perhaps you win!).
