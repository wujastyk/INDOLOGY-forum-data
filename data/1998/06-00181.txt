yoga-paTTa
In the ritual for changing the yajnopavIta, the sacred thread is spread
across the knees, from the beginning Acamana to the actual mantra
recited at the time of wearing the thread (yajnopavItam paramam pavitram
etc.). When reciting this mantra, it is removed from around the knees,
and held vertical between the two palms, right palm upward. The thread
is worn over the left shoulder at the close of this mantra. I'm not sure
if any dharma/gRhya sUtra text/commentary talks about it, or if it is
just one of those many ritual actions that one is supposed to do, with
no textual reference for it.
