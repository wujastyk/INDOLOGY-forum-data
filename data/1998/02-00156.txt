He does suggest that Candragupta Maurya became a vassal of Seleukos,
considering also that the treaty concluded between them is typically
that between a sovereign and a vassal: land is conceded (in casu an
enormous territory west of the Indus) in exchange for military
assistance (in casu 5OO war elephants with their trainers). That the
treaty stayed in vigour in later times can be seen when in 206 BC
Antiochus III again received war elephants from SubhAgasena /
SophagasEnos.
Personally I deem it possible that the Mauryas were both sovereign in
their own territory and vassals in the territory conceded to them by the
Seleucids.
I do not know of any such Greek translation or transcription, but in the
Aramaic inscriptions of Azoka at Taxila and Kandahar devAnAmpiya is
translated with mr'n (marAn), which had been the title of the Achaemenid
satraps of Egypt and Judea. This again strengthens the impression that
he was a vassal.
