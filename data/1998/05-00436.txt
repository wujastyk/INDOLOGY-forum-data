Indus - Sarasvati etc.
List members might be interested in seeing the May 8, 1998 issue of
Frontline, a Chennai magazine. It carries an article by Ram Sharan
Sharma of the Indian Council for Historical Reasearch (Delhi) on the
Indus-Sarasvati debate(s). There is another very informative article on
early (18th c.) German and Danish interest in Tamil studies.
