I rechecked all references to AryAs/dAsAs/dAsyus in Rgveda.  At number of
places I see preference to AryAs, but there are other combinations as well.
At one place it says 'Increase hate of AryAs and dAsAs'.  For me, the whole
AryA/dAsA/dAsyu conflict looks sham.  The references to these tribes looks
qualitatively or quantitatively no different from the references to other
mysterious peoples/tribes like Rbhus or angirasas &c with the exception that
AryAs and dAsAs fight out, while others dont. I also do not rule out Vedic
authors' liberal use of names of existing tribes to explain some of their 'pet
theories' just as they use Sun, Moon &c.  I would not give any weightage to
either Rgveda or GriffithpurANa unless there is other historic evidence. This
is my last letter on AryA/Dasyus.
I also read about Asuri (or long tongue) a Vedic seer.
There is also some new literature about Japanese Rgveda which has a character
Ashura who is a lady, or sometimes a person of uncertain sex.  Check out
http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/7201/rgv1.htm. Any scholars from Japan could
confirm these stories please?
