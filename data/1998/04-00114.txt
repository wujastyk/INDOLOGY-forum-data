Dr. Gilada of the Indian Health Organisation (IHO) mentioned to my mother a
while ago that there is a custom/ritual in some village(s)/tribe(s) by
which young girls are consecrated by a yearl ceremony to be 'prostitutes'.
They wear some kind of special stone or coin around their neck.  All I know
is this (not a lot) and that some of these girls are being treated in Dr.
Gilada's Aids Clinic in Bombay.
Could anyone who knows please tell me more about this?  Origin/meaning of
the custom, maybe some text references, and especially where it was/still
is practiced.  Trying to write a thing on different aspects of prostitution
in India.

Thanks
Nat
