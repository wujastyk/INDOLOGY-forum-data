A request to Bijoy Misra
In short, fast, crisp replies, all the original
message is repeated.
My feeling is that this may not be necessary.
People just see the original,they don't have
to see it again in seconds.
In India and elsewhere, people pay by the
number of words they receive in e-mails.
If you just post your reply, this will save
lot of money and bandwidth.
Just a thought.
