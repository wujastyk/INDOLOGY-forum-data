I'm game but this book is not readily available except through interlibrary
loan (which can take some time).  Could you summarize its main points?
There was a recent article suggesting that retroflexion in Sanskrit was
of IE origin.  Not very convincing though when you consider there is such
a close phonemic correspondence between this phenomenon in Dravidian
aqnd Indic.
I'm not an OoIer or an AITer, but from what I understand the OoI theorists
simply claim the relationship is due to "Aryans" migrating out of India
into Iran.  One bit of evidence they use is an Avestan tradition of
"homeland" somewhere to the east.
