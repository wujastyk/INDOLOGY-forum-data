prajnAnam Anandam brahma
Can somebody point me to a reference in one of the principal upanishads
where the sentence prajnAnam Anandam brahma occurs? aitareya has
prajnAnam brahma, while bRhadAraNyaka has vijnAnam Anandam brahma. I
couldn't find a reference where prajnAnam and Anandam are put together.
Thanks,
Vidyasankar
