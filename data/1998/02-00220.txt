Chess in India
A comprehensive (for the time) account of catura_nga can be found in
Manmohan Ghosh's critical edition of SUlapA.ni's catura_ngadIpikA: a
manual of four-handed chess(Calcutta Sanskrit Series No.XXI, 1936). As a
matter of fact, in a quick scan of this edition, Ghosh does mention the
"earliest reference to chess" as occurring in the
KarmAmak-i-ArtakshAtr-i-PApakAn, a Pahlavi romance.
If you need more info from this edition, please contact me.
