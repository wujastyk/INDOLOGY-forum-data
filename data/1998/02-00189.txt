Naciketas
Shalom to all,
Many of the MSS telling the story of Naciketas claim to be derived from
Brahmanda Purana, including the MSS in the India Office of the British
Library, that were translated by Belloni-Filippi.
Unfortunately, I have not succeeded in tracing a text of the Brahmanda
Purana that contains the Naciketa Katha.
Does anyone know of such a text and where it can be found?
Thanks in advance,
