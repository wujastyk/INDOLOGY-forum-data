I've heard that the bangAru kAmAkshI temple was established in Tanjavur
to house a vigraha that was brought from the Kanchipuram temple, not
from Kurnool. Around the end of the 18th century, during the wars of the
British with Tipu Sultan, most temple idols from Kanchipuram were
shifted to Tanjavur via Udayarpalayam. The idols from the ekAmreSa and
varadarAja perumAL temples were also hidden and taken away to
Udayarpalayam, and returned to Kanchipuram later in the 19th century.
There are also some records of the British East India government
partitioning the dharmakartA family rights to the bangAru kAmAkshI
temple in Tanjavur and the original temple in kAncIpuram, between two
branches of the family. In 1842, the management of the Kanchi temple was
transferred to the SAnkara maTha based in Kumbhakonam, which has since
shifted to Kanchipuram. And of course, Syama Sastri's compositions are
themselves full of references to kAmAkshI at Kanchipuram.
Did the Nawabs of Arcot have a great reputation for persecution of
Hindus? I thought they made many donations to Hindu religious
institutions. Those who fled from the Arcot/Kanchi region to Tanjavur
were probably more apprehensive of the outcome of the war with Tipu
Sultan, than about their local ruler's persecution.
