kamalAmba
There is a big difference between the change of case in the Ahiri
composition in the navAvaraNa set and in the Pharas composition on
Sukra. In the former, the change of case is in proper order, with a
steady pattern to it. In the Pharas composition, the change seems
uncalled for.
Also, in the Ahiri composition, each change of case is done in a
separate clause/sentence, which can stand by itself. There is kamalAmbA
jayati, followed by mahAtripurasundarIm rAjarAjeSvarIm cintaye'ham,
pAlito dayAkarayA and so on. In the Pharas composition, the rest of the
anupallavi and the caraNam have no separate verb, so that they have to
be connected to the pallavi, in order to make sense. Therefore, the
sambodhana sticks out in the middle of the dvitIyA. There can be no
doubt about the Ahiri composition being muttusvAmi dIkshitar's, but the
Pharas one remains debatable.
In the Ahiri navAvaraNa composition, the portion "brahmamaya prakASinI,
nAmarUpa vimarSinI, kAmakalA pradarSinI, sAmarasya nidarSinI" has to be
connected with the sentence kamalAmbA jayati (in the pallavi), so the
I-kArAnta is justified. It is effectively a final return to the
prathamA, in order to round off the composition. The sambodhana is
present in the word cinmAtre, which occurs in the sentence which uses
the dative case - SrI mAtre namaste cinmAtre. And if you notice the SrI
composition which uses sambodhana throughout, the i-kArAnta has been
transmitted by musicians quite properly.
It can also be explained in terms of an interpolation into an original
composition by muttusvAmi dIkshitar.
