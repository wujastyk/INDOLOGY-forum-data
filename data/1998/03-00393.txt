Tibetan Extensions to Unicode: TIBEX list
TIBEX MAIL LIST HELP FILE
=========================
The public mail list "tibex at unicode.org" is open to anyone who wishes
to be involved in technical discussions of Tibetan extensions to
Unicode / ISO10646.
1. SUBSCRIBE
You can subscribe to the Tibex public mail list by sending a message to
the list's "request" address.  The subject line of your message should
contain the word "subscribe".  The body of the message should contain a
subscription command, which has the following form:
 subscribe YOUR_ADDRESS tibex
For example, if your e-mail address is "V_WoodHull at whitehouse.gov" you
would subscribe to the list by sending a note to "tibex-request at unicode.org"
with the subject line "subscribe" and the contents as follows:
 subscribe V_WoodHull at whitehouse.gov tibex
(Your personal name should not be specified; only your electronic mail
address is needed for subscription.)  Subscriptions take effect
immediately, beginning with the next message posted to the list.
2. UNSUBSCRIBE
You may remove yourself from the mail list at any time by similarly sending
an "unsubscribe" message, for example, assuming your address is
"Leon_Trotsky at whitehouse.gov" you would unsubscribe by sending the following
message to the same address "tibex-request at unicode.org":
 unsubscribe Leon_Trotsky at whitehouse.gov tibex
3. POST MESSAGES
When you wish to post a message to the list itself (i.e., to the
subscribers), send it to "tibex at unicode.org", NOT to the request
address, "tibex-request at unicode.org".  The "-request" address is
only for subscription and unsubscription.
You may respond to posted messages by using your mailer's "reply"
feature.
4. CAVEAT EMPTOR
The subscription mechanism is very literal, and it doesn't know about all
the aliases by which you may be known.  Therefore when you subscribe please
make a note of your precise subscription address.  You will not be able to
unsubscribe without matching the precise address by which you subscribed.
For example, if you subscribe as "karl_marx at nowhere.com" then you will NOT
be able to unsubscribe by the name "k.marx at nowhere.com", or by
"karl_marx at mail.nowhere.com" or any other such mis-matched address.
5. NOTES
The mail lists are not serviced by a LISTSERV type of server.  The command
set of the server is limited to simple requests for addition & removal.
There is no digest mode.  The list of subscribers is not available.
Messages are usually archived on a temporary basis, but the archives are
not currently available for downloading; and there are no plans to make
them available.
