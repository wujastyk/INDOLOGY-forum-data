There's almost nothing.  Some texts on Asvasastra and Hastyayurveda have
been printed, for example

_Gaja Sastram of Palakapya Muni with extracts from other works and
coloured illustrations_ ed. & tr. K. S. Subrahmanya Sastri and S. Gopalan
(Tanjore, TMSSM Library, 1958).

_Asvasastram by Nakula with coloured illustrations_, ed. & tr. by S.
Gopalan, V. Svaminatha Atreya and K. S. Subramanya Sastri (Tanjore, TMSSM
Library, 1952).

See also

F. Edgerton, _The elephant-lore of the Hindus; the elephant-sport
(Matanga-lila) of Nilakantha)_ (Delhi, Motilal Banarsidass, 1985).
Reprint of 1931 ed.

An important recent study is

G. Jan Meulenbeld, "Conformities and divergences of basic Ayurvedic
concepts in veterinary texts" in _Journal of the European Ayurvedic
Society_ 1 (1990): 1-6.

GJM's article has a useful bibliography of relevant texts.

All the best,
Dominik
