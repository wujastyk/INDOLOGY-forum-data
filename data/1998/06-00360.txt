Black Death
There's almost nothing.  Some texts on Asvasastra and Hastyayurveda have
been printed, for example
_Gaja Sastram of Palakapya Muni with extracts from other works and
coloured illustrations_ ed. & tr. K. S. Subrahmanya Sastri and S. Gopalan
(Tanjore, TMSSM Library, 1958).
_Asvasastram by Nakula with coloured illustrations_, ed. & tr. by S.
Gopalan, V. Svaminatha Atreya and K. S. Subramanya Sastri (Tanjore, TMSSM
Library, 1952).

(Matanga-lila) of Nilakantha)_ (Delhi, Motilal Banarsidass, 1985).
Reprint of 1931 ed.
An important recent study is
G. Jan Meulenbeld, "Conformities and divergences of basic Ayurvedic
concepts in veterinary texts" in _Journal of the European Ayurvedic
Society_ 1 (1990): 1-6.
GJM's article has a useful bibliography of relevant texts.
All the best,
