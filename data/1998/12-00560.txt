Kamban's Aryan
Ch. Vaudeville in her oft-cited essay: Evolution of love symbolism in
Bhagavatism (JAOS, 1962) writes about a possible link between the Sufi
movement (with its origins in Baasra) and the Bhakti movement (in south).
There were already strong trade links between Baasra and the Malabar coast.
Are there any other (/further) studies exploring this link?
