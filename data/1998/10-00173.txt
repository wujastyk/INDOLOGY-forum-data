"The Tale of the Indo-European Horse Sacrifices."
Dear Agnes
Thank you so much for your kind offer!
I have however, now managed to get in touch with Wendy
Doniger herself, and she has posted off a copy for me.  I
should get this within a few days.
I would also like to thank others who have written in response
to my message.  ...And I must say, I am greatly enjoying the
offshoot discussion that this has sparked off!  Great fun :-)!
Thank you all!
All the best
