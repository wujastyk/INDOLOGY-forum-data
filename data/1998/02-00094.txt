Regarding N. Ganesan's query about Tamil words that have entered English and
"some good dictionary of English available where one can search a keyword
like Tamil, Malayalam, Telugu, Tulu, Kannada, Dravidian in that database", I
would suggest, in the first place, the OED on CD ROM. The search engine that
goes with it makes it possible to compile a list of words of foreign origin
in English with their etymologies and dates of their first (attested)
appearance in the language. Then there are several specialized dictionaries,
e.g. the time-hallowed Hobson Jobson, and several other books of reference
and as well as special monographs, some of which can be found in the
following select bibliography:

>Are rice and tamil 'arici' related?
I am sure it is a Tamil loanword appearing not only in English but also in
other European languages (e.g. Czech ryze via Greek oryza).

>Vaguely remember a book by Subbarao, Indian words in English.
This is perhaps the first scholarly treatment of the growth and development
of South Asian element in English. Incidentally, I am presently engaged in
preparing a study entitled (provisionally) "Anglo-Indian Encounters.
Loanwords of South Asian Origin in English".
