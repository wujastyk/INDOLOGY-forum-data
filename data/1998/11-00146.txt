Paired Horse and PIE breakup
[snip]...ideas can be carried without the need for population movements.
This seems to be the crux of the discussion thread as it has evolved so far.
Unless there is substantial material evidence, e.g., movements of
pottery-types, weapons, or chariots, it would appear to be a tough problem to
distinguish between the two categories of phenomena: diffusion of ideas and
demography.
There is a good possibility that many languages were the parole, ca. 3000 BC,
even in small geographical zones, as evidenced in Sumer; it is also notable
that multiple languages did not deter or handicap, the expansion of the
economic imperatives generated by the bronze-age discoveries.
