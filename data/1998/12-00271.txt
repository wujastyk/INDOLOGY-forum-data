I have seen hundreds of images/pictures of

I can assure you that
"nrttezvara, nIlakantha, hAlahAla forms"
are rare (in fact, I don't remember a
single one).  I don't doubt that they
exist.  But they are untypical.  You
will have to search hard for them.
There is a famous picture of Mao in his
sixties, swimming across the Yangtze river
in winter.  This is an untypical aspect of
Mao.  On the basis of this untypical aspect
of Mao, we cannot conclude that he is closely
related to the "baiji" or Yangtze river dolphin.
  :-)  :-)  No offence, can't resist.   :-)
Many Indian, esp. Tantric, deities do.
Why, my own 11-year old nephew... well,
let me leave it at that.
This is a really interesting link, one
that I din't know about.  Thank you.
Would like to know more...
Pardon my ignorance, but what's that?
Is it an astrological term?
Many Tantric deities do.  Why, I myself...
well, let's stop here.
Best regards.  No offence intended by
the silly jokes.
Raja.
