Always charmed by English statement:
"God is nowhere" can be made into "God is now here" too.

In Tamil, "naTaraajar illAtatillai" is an equivalent.

This can be split as:
"naTaraajar illAtatu illai" - Nothing is without Nataraja.
   OR
"naTaraajar illAta  tillai" - Chidambaram (world) is without Nataraja.

Have a good weekend,
