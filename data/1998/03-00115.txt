Tamil Sound and Writing
Another possibility I forgot to mention is that, the Indian alphabet may be a
Dravidian invention which was improved upon by later migrations.  It is a good
practice to open up all possibilities, then discuss the pros and cons instead
of biasing ourselves about one possibility.
