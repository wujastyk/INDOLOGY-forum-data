I forgot to mention. Drav retroflexes are as old as PD, maybe 3000 BCE. The
PD phonemes are: p t _t .t c k, m n .n ~n, l .l, r .z, w y H (a laryngeal)=
17 consonants; i e a o u (long and short)= 10 vowels. Alveolars and
retroflexes do not occur word initially. This distributional characteristic
is partly reflected in IA also, e.g no initial .n, .l, and .s. Through sound
change, initial  *_t (=*_r) .t, .d, l, *.l, *.z occur word initially in
South Central Drav languages. PD has contrastive minimal pairs for:

Initial: t-
Medial: t : _t : .t
also:   tt : _t_t; .t.t
post-nasal : nt: n_t: .n.t
             ntt: n_t_t: .n.t.t
Finally : no obstruent occurs; only sonorants occur

Alveolar and retroflex stops have the same distribution as the other
obstruents except that they do not occur word-initially.

There is no evidence to derive the alveolars and retroflexes as secondary
phonemes.
