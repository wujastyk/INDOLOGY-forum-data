Next World Sanskrit Conference
Dear Indologists,
I have NO communication whatsoever from Turin so far except the official announcement made at the Bangalore conference last year to hold the next World Sanskrit Conference in Turin in the year 2000.  I heard the other day in Paris that Prof Botto and his team are preparing the first circular and that it will be sent soon.
Dr Shivamurthy Swamiji
