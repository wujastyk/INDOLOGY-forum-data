BUDDHIST REJECTION OF MUSIC
The buddhistmonks, at least in Theravada, are not allowed to listen to
music, but why? What is in fact the definition of music according to the
buddhists?
So far I have found litte materials regarding the(se) subject(s) and will
be very happy to receive and answers and/or references, both to primary-
and secondary texts.
Thank you!
Jon
