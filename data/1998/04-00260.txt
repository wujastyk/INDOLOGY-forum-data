I do not subscribe to the practice of human sacrifice. India has a free
press. Considering human sacrifice is a sensational item the press will
report such incidents without fail in order to increase circulation, it is
obvious that such incidents are not common or atleast no more than other
types of inhuman practices in the rest of the world. There are sick people
in India just there are such people elsewhere.I thought Lars Mortin Fousse's
well-balanced and level headed posting, will make others to see things in
proper perspective and stop baiting Hindus.
Here is his posting:
I read some years ago in The Economist (I think) that about a 100 people
were "sacrificed" in India every year. Considering that India has a
population of about 900 million people, I think the right reference here is
not "history of religion" but psychopathology. Compare weird religious acts
in Christian extremist sects, as well as other non-Christian extreme sects
in the West.
