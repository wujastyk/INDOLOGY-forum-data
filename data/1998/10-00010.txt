I request you to refer to the following web pages:
http://sarasvati.simplenet.com/html/ricediffusion.htm 
     A map detailing the diffusion of black and red ware and rice from     
Lothal (2200 BC) to Sonpur (650 BC)attesting to the continuity of the     
civilization.
http://sarasvati.simplenet.com/Indian%20Lexicon/rice.htm
     A few pages of ancient lexemes of Indian languages related to       many
forms of rice. This semantic cluster is one sample from among       thousands
of lexical repertoire where the Dravidian/Mundarica etyma       and Aryan
etyma coalesce, in a remarkable dialectical continuum from       Gujarati to
Bengali, from Nepali to Tamil to Sinhalese.
