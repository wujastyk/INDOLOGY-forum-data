Grantha primer
A Primer in Grantha Characters by K. Venugopalan is not a reprint, but a
first edition.
I inquired today at South Asia Books and found they still have 10 copies in
stock.  The original price was $1.50.  Please contact South Asia Books for
more information.

Alternatively, Motilal Banarsidass may still have copies in Delhi.  They
have the beginnings of a site at <http://www.mlbd.com/index.html>.
