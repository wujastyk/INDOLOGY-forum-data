Req: Variants in MBh, AB too
I would like a small favor from someone with ready access to the
critical edition of Mahabharata, as it seems overkill to use
interlibrary loan for this.
Are there any variant reading in CE 1.13.25a and 1.176.35d? I am
interested especially in variants of the word bhavitrii.
A related question: Do editions of Aitreya Brahmana show variant
readings for 3.22.1 ``sainaan abraviit praatar va.h prativaktaasmiiti''?
Thanks in advance
Nath
