Interesting, but I'm quite sure I will not find any Scythian
"manuscripts" there.
I guess I'm treading on holy ground here. But the fact remains that
IE is nothing but a theory.
I see. Now that one can give these languages a good "white" origin
all of a sudden they are related again.  First you claim that
Iranians were the original steppe dwellers.  Then you modify that to
include speakers of Caucasian and Yenesei-Ostyak.  Then, you assert
there may not be an Altaic family, and even if there is it is not
related to Uralic. Now, you think all these are related under the
Caucasoid Nostratic banner.
Let me say the idea that early Scythians were mixtures of
Mongoloid and "Europid" people have led to much confusion. Just
A little research on the term "Europid" reveals that it was a term
used in early literature to postulate a herrenvolk movement through
SE Asia and Indonesia into the Pacific.  In most modern literature,
it is referred to as Southern Mongoloid.  However, the whole Tarim
Basin-Siberia-Kennewick line of argument has tried to resurrect the
old dark whitetheory in favor of blond Caucasoids peopling the New
World and gifting the Chinese with horses.
The skeletons associated with Scythian burials are by and large
platyrrhine and prognathous with wide prominent malars and robust
mandibles.  That is, they do not conform to modern Iranian or
European phenotypes and most of the burials are not that old in
relative terms.
I guess we have reached the end of enlightenment in our discussion.
However, I will discuss the matter with anyone who doesn't see the
Scythian/Hsiung-nu likenesses as purely coincidental.
