Subject: Tamil echo formation (Was Re: Hindi-Urdu echo-nouns in v)

Unlike in Hindi, echo formation in Tamil (possibly in other Dravidian
languages also) is quite regular. Almost all nouns in Tamil can form echo
construction.

When the first syllable of a noun is replaced either with ki or kI, we
get the echo counter part.  ki is used to replace syllables with short
vowels and kI is used for long vowels.

   Examples:  puttakam kittakam,  vITu kITu, pATTu kITTu etc.
   Proper names: jAn kiin, mEri kIri, rAmasAmi kImasAmi
   Vowel initial words: ATu kITu, eRumpu kiRumpu, ENi kINi etc.

(Some verbal participle forms also undergo echo formation: ATi kITi paar,
pEsi kIsi vacciTAtE...)

However, those nouns that begin either in ki or kii do not undergo echo
formation.  *kiLi kiLi,  *kiitA kiitA...

I guess the same is the case with other Dravidian languages Telugu,
Malayalam, Kannada etc.  I think Masica uses the features such as
reduplication, onomotopoeic words, free word order etc., besides echo
formation to substantiate his claim that "India is a linguistic area".

Vasu.
