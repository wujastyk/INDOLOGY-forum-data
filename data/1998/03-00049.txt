Very well: At the written level, you have the following pair:
                katt    kart    (cat - map)
Pronounced:     kat     ka.t
(.rt > .t is also known from Indic)
Furthermore:    mat     malt    (food - painted, East Norw. dialect)
Pronounced:     ma:t    ma:.t
I must emphasize that such words are only minimal pairs when pronounced.
When written, historical orthography keeps them apart.
