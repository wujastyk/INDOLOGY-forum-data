Ramohun Roy is certainly relevant to the history of Indian interest in
Latin and Greek, though it is uncertain how much of them he knew himself.
Unfortunately, Joanna Kirkpatrick has picked up an exaggerated picture of
his scholarship. _The Precepts of Jesus_ (1820) does not itself show any
knowledge of Latin, Greek or Hebrew; it is merely a compilation from the
King James (1611) version of the Gospels. Greek and Hebrew appear in his
_Second Appeal to the Christian Public in Defence of the Precepts of
Jesus_ (1821) and his _Final Appeal..._ (1823). Even here, we should not
suppose that he thought up all his arguments from unaided first-hand
reading of the texts. The ground had been well trodden by Unitarian
scholars in the West.

        There is some material on this in my _Rammohun Roy in Hindu and
Christian Tradition_ (Newcastle upon Tyne, Grevatt and Grevatt, 1993),
but there is room for more research on Rammohun's place in the history of
Unitarian biblical scholarship.

        By the way, Rammohun's position as dewan was not in Calcutta.
