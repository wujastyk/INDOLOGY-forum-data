Interesting point, David. However, a word of caution here: When I did
national service in the Norwegian army, I was taught to be a cryptographer.
We learnt that to make decipherment difficult for the enemy, manual codes
often had several representations of the most common letters, so that
statistics shouldn't be made too easy. (E.g.: the letter e is the most
common letter in the Norwegian language. Therefore this letter could be
represented in the code key by, say, x b and t. I think the same may obtain
with a script like the Harappan one. Several signs may represent the same
set of characters or concepts.
I think, by the way, that Parpola has used statistical techniques on the
Indus script, but I am not certain about it.
