Iranians in Ancient India
Dear colleagues,
        can anybody give me a reference to Sanskrit texts or secondary sources
mentioning the presence of Iranians (Magas or otherwise) in Ancient or Mediaeval
India (especially, in historical Magadha/Bihar)?
        Thanks in advance
                                Yaroslav Vassilkov
