I'm in Amsterdam, where the publication is also "incognita".

But the on-line catalog of the Leiden U. Libr. yields:

Incognita : international journal for cognitive studies in the
humanities. -
Vol. 1, nr. 1 (1990) - vol. 2, nr. 2 (1991). - Leiden : Brill,
1990-1991. - 25 cm
Verschijnt 2 per jaar. - Niet verder verschenen.
ISSN 0923-7135 = Incognita (Amsterdam)

I'm sorry, I only have access to the Amsterdam (UvA) U. Libr., so I
can't help the original poster in a more practical way.
