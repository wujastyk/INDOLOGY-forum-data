I'm not sure who introduced these utterances into the discussion, but I
have a simple question about the second one.

* vAkyam uvaca rAmam
* dAnaM dadau rAmam

If the asterisks before these utterances do *not* mean that these are
incorrect utterances, will somebody please direct me to a grammatical
authority who sanctions the double accusative with daa?

(I would expect only

daanaM dadau raamaaya

or

daanaM dadau raamasya)

Thank you in advance.
