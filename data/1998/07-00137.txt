double accusative (was Re: passive of causatives)
I'm not sure who introduced these utterances into the discussion, but I
have a simple question about the second one.
* vAkyam uvaca rAmam
* dAnaM dadau rAmam
If the asterisks before these utterances do *not* mean that these are
incorrect utterances, will somebody please direct me to a grammatical
authority who sanctions the double accusative with daa?
(I would expect only
daanaM dadau raamaaya
or
daanaM dadau raamasya)
Thank you in advance.
