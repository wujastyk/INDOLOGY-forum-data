Dear Indologists,
A few months ago there was a thread going about devoted pets and devoted
pet owners.
Recently, while reading the Rajatarangini I ran across an unusual
reference to a cat who became sati upon the death of her master, King
Sussala. It seems the modern tendency to anthropomorphize our pets is
not new.
Does anyone know of any other sati pets?
