     The American Theological Library Association's ATLA Religion Database
(formerly known as the Religion
     Index), is the leading international database indexing citations in the
scholarly fields of religion. The ATLA
     Religion Database covers such topics as Biblical studies, world
religions, Church history, and religious
     perspectives on social issues. The database consists of more than one
million records covering the research
     literature of religion in more than 30 languages. It includes more than
200,000 articles from 650 journals, more
     than 300,000 essays from 14,000 multi-author works, and more than
300,000 book reviews. Dating from
     1949 to the present, the database is an essential resource for
researchers and students in theology as well as in
     social sciences, history and humanities. The full file covers data from
1949 to the present; the 10 year subset
     includes data from the most recent 10 years.
