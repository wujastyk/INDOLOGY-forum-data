          Sandal Mountain Breeze
          ***********************

  I am intrigued by Dr. S. Palaniappan's question
  relating to Sandal mountain breeze.
  Mr. Sarma quotes many passages from MBh.
  But are they from Southern recensions of MBh?

  Also, do they talk of malaya breeze tormenting separated
  lovers?  This theme of malaya mountain breeze tormenting
  lovers in separation and being pleasant when lovers are together
  is as old as Tamil literature (cilappatikaaram, Azvaar poetry,
  Kamban etc.,) Who makes use of this theme first in Sanskrit?
  Is it Kalidasa or Jayadeva? Or is this concept as old as Ramayana
  or atleast Mahabharatha?

The Madurai stalapuraaNam states that Nataraja comes down South
and dances facing South because "the Southern sandal mountain breeze
soothes him when he gets tired doing the cosmic dance".
