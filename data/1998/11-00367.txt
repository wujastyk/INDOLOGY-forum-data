Lokayatam material
Additional data:
JayamkoNTar is the author of Kalingattup ParaNi,
a war pirapantam of the Imperial Cholas.
Between his two works, paraNi and maDal,
there are certain unique phrases, words,
expressions in common and found nowhere
else in Tamil literature. Parani is
in kalit taazicai and MaDal is in kaliveNpaa
meter. Working with veNpaa meter along
with the same etukai is very difficult
for mediocre poets.
In my last mail, I wrote Stickholm, The correct
name is, of course, Stockholm.
