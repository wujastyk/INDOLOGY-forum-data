Very very belated reply
About a year ago, I received an e-mail from someone on Indology who had
written an alternate history of India featuring word play from Hobson-Jobson.
I kept meaning to reply, didn't, and now can't find the e-mail. I checked the
Indology archives and wasn't able to find it, which leads me to think it was a
privately sent e-mail.
So if that someone would care to resend it, I'll be more careful this time
around.
