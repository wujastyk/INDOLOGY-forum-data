The ending
My thanks to everybody who has responded to my question about "Amma". I
however do have a further question:
I wrote:
makes me think that the name "kr*SNamAcAri is from kr*SNamA and not
kr*SNa),
to which Mani Varadarajan writes:
Sure, I can see how it works but then what I cannot understand is since
rAmAnujan becomes rAmanujam, then shoouldn't we have names like
rAmanujamAcArya( as well as rAmAnujAcAraya)? What is special about
kr*SNa(m) that you have kr*SNamAcArya as well as kr*SNAcArya?
I would also like to mention here the *sectarian* difference in the
name: Most krS*NamAcAryas are zrIvaiSNava ; most kr*SNAcAryAs are
mAdhva( consequently, the later seems to be common in Karnataka but is
rare in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil NAdu). And from the responses I've
seen, the phenomenon of male names ending in "amma" seems to be common
in Andhra Pradesh but is less common elsewhere..
So, is the name kR*SNamAcArya originally from the Telugu speaking areas?
Regards and thanking you for your help,
Krishna
