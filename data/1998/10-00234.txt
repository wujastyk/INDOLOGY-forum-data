Relationship Between Temple Architecture and Cosmology
Dr. M. Rabe writes:
  Even though Rajasimha called it only as Rajasimhesvaram putting
  his stamp on his creation, the temple was called Kailasanatha temple
  from early on and not only in modern times.
  The PeriyapuraaNam hagiography of Puusalaar Naayanaar. This poor
devotee
  builds a temple inside his heart. Siva descends from Kailasa to
  adorn Puusalaar's temple rather than the mighty king's creation.
  This King is Rajasimha, acc. to many scholars.
  The Rashtrakuuta monument, Kailasanatha at Ellora is inspired
  by Kailasanatha at Kanchi, acc. to C. Sivaramamuti.
