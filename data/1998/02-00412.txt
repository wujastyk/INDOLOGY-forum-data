>?From memory, I think Jan Gonda's early work _Sanskrit in Indonesia_
describes similar formations in SE Asian languages. In English we have
'toil and moil', 'fudge and mudge', but I don't know of others. (The
well-known formations such as 'job schmob', modelled on Yiddish, have a
different sort of meaning.)
