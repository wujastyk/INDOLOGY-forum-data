It seems to me that you are dodging the question. I don't recollect that we
have discussed that question before.
So let me repeat the question:

I am a bit curious about this. When we look at the arguments put forward by
German Indologists in the 1930's about the homeland (which was preferably to be
put somewhere in the middle of Germany :-)), it is easy to see a political
bias. However, it would be interesting (at least for me) to know how you
construe the motives and prejudices of modern Western Indologists like e.g.
Witzel, Zydenbos and myself. For one thing: how do we profit politically or
otherwise from assuming that the homeland was somewhere in Eurasia? (Mind you:
personally, I have no dogmatic idea about WHERE in Eurasia it was. I only
contend that it wasn't in India, and for this I state linguistic and cultural
reasons).
The reason why I go on about this, is that it often seems to be assumed that
Western Indologists somehow share the same prejudices as their colleagues a
century ago. Therefore, a clear answer to the question stated above would be
most interesting.
What a pity! Having to wait for moksha makes it less instant :-(
Unfortunately, the quote (whoever said it) contains an error: To begin with,
Europeans thought that the Indo-Europeans came from somewhere in Asia. A party
was in favour of the Hindu Kush. Others claimed the point of origin would be
somewhere in Asia north of the Himalayas. It is only in the second half of this
century that Asia is "out" and Eurasia "in".
However strong the indictment, it is not born out by the facts. So, whoever
wrote it did not have a good day :-)
