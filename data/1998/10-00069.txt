Ramayana comparisons
On the sublject, there was also a comparison between the Iliad and the
Ramayana by an Indian scholar in the beginning of the '80, now published as
a book, but not very valuable according to me.
The best comparisons are made by the Oxonian anthropologist Nick Allen in
various articles.

indo-europ?enne: correspondances et transformations hell?no-aryennes,

in the last JRAS).
There are much more to compare between the story of Rama and the Heracles
cycle!
