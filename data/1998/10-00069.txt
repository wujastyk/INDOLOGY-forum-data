On the sublject, there was also a comparison between the Iliad and the
Ramayana by an Indian scholar in the beginning of the '80, now published as
a book, but not very valuable according to me.
The best comparisons are made by the Oxonian anthropologist Nick Allen in
various articles.
See also Christophe VIELLE, Le mytho-cycle h?ro?que dans l'aire
indo-europ?enne: correspondances et transformations hell?no-aryennes,
Louvain-la-Neuve, 1996, Publications de l'Institut orientaliste de Louvain
46 (in a non-dumezilian, and non "proto-"Indo-European, perspective: review
in the last JRAS).
There are much more to compare between the story of Rama and the Heracles
cycle!
