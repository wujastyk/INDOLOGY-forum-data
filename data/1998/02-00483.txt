In addition to the above we have a verb kammu- in telugu with the
meaning 'spread' or 'fill up'.

AkAzaM niMDA mabbulu kammukonnAyi =  the whole sky is filled with
                                           clouds or clouds have spread
                                     through the whole sky

inTi niMDA poga kammukoMdi = smoke has spread throghout the house or
                             the whole house is filled with smoke

kam- appears to have good smell meaning in the word 'kammani',
if we assume that kam- which originally qualified smell has later
been used to qualify taste.

                kammani ruci = pleasent taste
                kammani vAsana = pleasent smell

regards,

sarma.
