>Dear Indologists,
>        I am currently researching some aspects of the history of the study
of flowering plants for some popular science writing. One of the most
crucial issues in such a history is that of sexual reproduction by plants.
Although the Greeks appear to have understood that some plants like the date
palm were unable to fertilize themselves and recognized two different flower
types, pollen was regarded as a form of excrement rather than an agent of
fertilization.
>        So far, in my amateur inquiries into early Indian writings, I find
references to male and female flowers based on their shape or form and
descriptions of pollen as dust, but no specific mention of hybridization or
pollination. Yet there are some poetic texts that seem to include pollen
gathering by bees in metaphors for amorous pastimes. Are ther any sources
 In English or another Western language) that I can be directed to?
