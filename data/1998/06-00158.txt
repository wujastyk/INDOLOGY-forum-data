Given this reasoning by DEVARAKONDA VENKATA NARAYANA SARMA:

>In the yoga sutras of Patanjali, AsanA which is one of the aSTAngAs
>(which are the necessary aids) of yoga, is defined as

>sthira-sukhamAsanaM

>AsanA is the one that is stable and comfortable. This will be an aid in
>allowing the sAdhakA to forget his body and loose himself in meditation.
>Yoga-paTTa seems to help in making your posture stable and comfortable.

I wonder how widespread the use of a yoga-paTTa actually is.
