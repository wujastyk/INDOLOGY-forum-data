If you could use any of the known system for
transcription like the Kyoto-Harvard-convention,
not sending Apple-documents and no
BINHEX-documents, just writing a simple
text-formatted document we could help you
probably. Italian language is not known to all.

Betreff: Re: Jain inscription


Dear John Smith, I have been really happy to
receive your response.
Regarding the inscription, I need comparative
material - mainly
epigraphical one - to give an adequate historical
and linguistical
collocation to this small inscription. In the
meanwhile, let me offer you
the small results of such a study in progress.
Paleographically, the
inscription's characters fit very well with the
specimens from Sirohi
district belonging to XIII-XIV century. The
engraving is rather rough, so
that it shows the secondary importance of the
commitment.
The tentave reading so far detected by me is as
follows:
1.      siddham || sa?vat 1349 phagu?a ?udi 5
ravidivyo | u esa (?)
y?cchaka kva(?) dh?c? ya(?) san?to ?r^
Siddhasanasuri ?r^(?) Vikrama(?)
2.      bhadr?saha draja(?) sakha?ga?aputtra suta
som?j? s^tala e(?)s^?ha
usas dra  bhaya s^havasan?th? (raralu?)
3.       padamadgarap?la | deh?suta naradeva (ka?)
dh^j? | prat? (?)
kya(ka?)lpy?? je gamala {ma?gala} ||

The date has been tested as corresponding to AD
1292, February 24th,
sunday. The language should be a kind of early
Gujarati, but on order to
get a better idea I need to see several
inscriptions of this type, but in
Italy libraries are not so well endowed with...
Moreover, I add the scanty bibliography available
to me at moment:

Literature, Bulletin of the Deccan College
Research Institute, XVI (June
1954-March 1955). Poona.

As attachment you will find a short note (in
Italian language) on the small
item, written in McIntosh - Microsoft Word 5.1.
Any kind of suggestion and emprovement of the
study - through
bibliographical material for instance - well be
greatly wellcome!
Many thanks. Riccardo Garbini.
