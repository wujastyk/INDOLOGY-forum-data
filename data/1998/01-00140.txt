solution to the "kuyava' etymology
Regarding the formulation of the i/e  and u/o sound change model proposed by
Bh. Krishnamurthy,  there seems to be some disagreements between Dr.
Krishnamurthy and Dr. P.S. Subrahmanyam as has been pointed out by Dr.
Krishnamurthy himself in his foreword to Subrahmanyam?s book, "Dravidian
Comparative Phonology". But Subrahmanyam does agree with Krishnamurthy
regarding Krishnamurthy?s basic view : Proto-Dravidian had all the four vowels
i,e,u,o in the root syllable of (C)VC type. In Proto-South Dravidian they
remained as such when high vowels or zero followed in the next syllable, i.e.
(C)VC-i/u/0; but when a low vowel -a followed i,u merged with e,o;
i.e.PD*(C)i/uC-a >PSD*(C)e/oC-a- (rule of vowel harmony or umlaut). Then,
Early Tamil (which included Malayalam) changed these sequences to i,u (rule of
dissimilation) throughout.
Krishnamurthy based his conclusion regarding the nature of the proto-South
Dravidian phonemic status (whether they were *i/*u or *e/*o) on the
contraction of the root vowel and derivative vowel which takesplace when the
intervening *-k-, *-y- (<*-c-) or *-v- is lost. In his book "Telugu Verbal
Bases", Krishnamurthy gives the following processes
I. (a). *iC-[I,u > I                      II (a). *uC-[I,u >U
   (b). *iC-[a > E                           (b). *uC-[a> O
   (c). *eC-[I,u,a > E                     (c). *oC-[i,u,a > O
