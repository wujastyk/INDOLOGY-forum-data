Are there any textual bases for this statement? 

There was an elaborate posting by Vidyanatha Rao on the chariot issue; I don't
know if I missed the point about diffusion of chariots from Mesopotamia; is
there any comparison between the Mesopotamian solid-wheeled chariot driven by
a pair of onagers and the Sintashta-type Central Asian solid-wheeled
horse-drawn chariots?
