Subject: Tagore's End of the Century
Message-ID: <161227042051.23782.8166205317992808615.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Can anyone give me the text of Tagore's poem written on the last day of the
last century?

As I recall, it begins "The bloodred sun ..." and ends several vivid and
powerful verses later "Keep watch India...thy dawn has not yet..." I have
seen it cited/entitled "The Sunset of the Century" but since he did not
assign titles, I have been unable to track it down.

Any help would be appreciated. I want to use it as the opening page for a
"20th Century World Cultures" text.

Please reply to sconyerd at franklin.edu.

Many thanks...............DS
