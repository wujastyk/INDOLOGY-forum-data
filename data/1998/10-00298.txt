SV: method of dating RV, III
Regarding the statement that the rgveda and the avesta represent
relics of a common Indian & Iranian tradition (that of the "second
Aryan homeland" to use Y.Vassilkov's phrase -- I'd find the term
Indo-Iranian misleading here) what is the conventional wisdom
as to why they ended up in two different metrical systems? Some
things were shared (poetic formulary, religious concepts) while
others were not (metrical forms), but why?
