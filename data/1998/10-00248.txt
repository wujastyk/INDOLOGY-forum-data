I am no expert in Indus Valley Civilisations, but I seem to remember seeing
things very much like svastikas in original and plaster cast models of
seals from Mohenjo Daro in the Indian National Museum. ** And again in
runic inscriptions where the lightning bolt motif of the god Thor is
interlocked to make a svastika with pointed ends (which I think was the
origin of Hitler's SS-swastika).  Of course, svastikas are very common in
my svade'sa of Arizona, among the Navajo they refer to the four directions
and have no direct meaning of blessing.  It is clearly a compelling sign
and an attractive design form. Again, just armchair observation.
