Rasaratnasamuccaya
Dom:
A student in the department went to India, and while there obtain for me
the translation in the separate volumes, as the one volume edition and
trans is no longer available.
This is what he got for me:
Edition and trans of Rasaratnasamuccaya, chapters 1-8 (1987-89, with
nothing published in 1989).
My question is: Were any more chapters published that I don't have. If
so, which ones, so I can have the student obtain those.
The single volume edition was published in 1991-92, so no more chapters
could have appeared after that.
Thanks for the help.
Ken
