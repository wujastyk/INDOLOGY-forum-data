I am not sure if it can be generalized about modern Hindus/Indians. In
recent times I have seen many Hindus (even uppercaste conservative
families) having cats in their houses. Sure, the percentage may still be
very small but it is definitely increasing. In our own house after a few
dogs in the last 30 years we have been having about 5 generations of
cats.. including 7 currently.
