Sarasvati (texts & arch.III)
Michael,
Just two questions off-list.
You write, on the IE [?]-strate in Mitanni Hurrian:
Am I to interpret that as that you agree with me that the IE element
in Mitanni Hurrian is *Indo-Iranian* not necessarily Indo-Aryan
(after all, Proto-Indo-Iranian "1" may have been *aika, right?)?
What does "Bactrian civilization" refer to exactly?  I suspect the
area of urban settlememts along the Amu Darya (Shortugai, Namazga)
all the way to Shah Tepe etc. on the Caspian, but I'm not familiar
with the term.
Greetings,
