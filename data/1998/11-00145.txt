Paired Horse and PIE breakup

Yes, but could you address the cultures I mention above. I agree that
horses are fairly important in the Vedas, and also in later Indian
religion.
My knowledge of European and Iranian mythology and ritual is limited to
a few university courses and some personal reading (like Dumezeil,
Campbell, _The Golden Bough_, etc.).
I don't recall the prominence of horses in these mythologies, although
they do exist. The horse played a great role in the ritual of Altaic and
certain Uralic peoples though.
Yes, but it doesn't involve any significant migrations of the
originating culture (whichever that is) to the places now using
computers. Just as Marco Polo presumbaly brought technology regarding
gunpowder, the printing press, the mechanical clock and so on to the
West, ideas can be carried without the need for population movements.
