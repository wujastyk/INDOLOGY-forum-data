To all my correspondents whom I gave my second, hotmail address as
yavass at hotmail.com  - Sorry, it is WRONG! Please correct, the right address is

        vassilkov at hotmail.com

        I use it only on special occasions and so rare that I have managed to
forget the login. Excuse me.
        All the best,
                                        Ya.V.
