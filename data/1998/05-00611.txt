Correct about innovations, but not always: Those who brought American

Avestan (and Old Persian) also have innovated in certain respects. But
Vedic has been "Indianized", Avestan has not, and it has been less
"Iranized" than Vedic has been affected by S. Asian features.
Oral tradition (well fixed in India, less so in Iran) is affected only by
minimal *phonetical* changes (on both sides, more in Iran); the texts
remain stable. No "late interpolations" which we cannot detect
immediately.
