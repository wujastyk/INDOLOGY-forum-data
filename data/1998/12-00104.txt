Yup.  And Franconian (Frankish) is Germanic, while Francien (French)
is Romance.  Same thing.  Typical confusion of signifiant and
signifie.
Tamil is Dravidian (with Indo-Aryan borrowings), Urdu is Indo-Aryan
(with Persian-Arabic borrowings), and Sankrit was codified (not
created) by Panini.  Linguists stopped talking about "degraded" forms
of speech about 200 years ago.  We leave that kind of talk to the
amateurs, or to the lunatics on both sides.
