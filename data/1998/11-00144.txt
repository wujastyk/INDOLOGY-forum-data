Paired Horse and PIE breakup

Yes, you have the Sumerian "ur" and even in Southeast Asia and the
Pacific you have words like uru, ari, aru, uran, oran, etc. for "man,
people."
Again in Austronesian you have dan, dano, danum, tano for "water," and
"tunu" for "left-over water."  In Sumerian, "tin" means "liquid."
I think this illustrates how difficult it is to make theories based on
limited numbers of words without any reliable examples of morphology or
phonology.
