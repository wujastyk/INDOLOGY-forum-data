But I think most linguists do not see any relationship between Etruscan
and IE.

Many people explain the spread of agriculture through demic diffusion
originating somewhere in Syro-Palestine or Mesopotamia. I'm sure if you
can put a language tag, but the thrust seems more toward peoples
like the Etruscans, Basques, Picts, etc.  That is, people before IE
migrations.

Well, the substratum could come from extinct languages that, unlike
Etruscan, were not literate. Or they were literate and have not left
traces that have been found. I don't think anyone would suggest that
Germanic and Slavic are "pure" languages free of any non-IE influence.
Certainly there are at least some Finno-Ugrian influences even in the
oldest examples of these languages.
