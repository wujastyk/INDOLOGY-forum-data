YogasUtra, Update
Dear listmembers,
One of my postgrad students is doing research on relations between yoga
and sAMkhya. As he is not on this list, I promised him to ask for updated
references to literature on the Yoga SUtra. He is particularly interested
in YS _as text_ (history, background etc.).
In this connection: do some  of you know what happened to the book by T.
Gelblum on Yoga Philosophy, planned as part of Fasc. 5 in the 6th vol. of
Gonda's History of Indian Literature?. And now we are on that subject,
what about the other missing parts (e.g. UpaniSads)?
Kind regards
