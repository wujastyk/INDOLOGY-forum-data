camel
Is there anybody among the members who came across
a literally source, that explains the meaning of a
camel (female) which is sent to an outside prince.
Could it probably be similar to a horse looking
for a new king?
However, the prince got the message "come soon"
and became king.
The text can be explained as: Prasenajit sent a
(female) camel (uTTavAmA) to Srenika, meaning
"come soon"
or: Prasenajit sent camelriders (with the message)
"come soon".
I would like to know about different sources,
where a female camel alone stands for something
like the inthronisation.
