Question on Brhatkatha
For peruGkatai, please see:
1. Donald A. Nelson, The Brhatkatha: a reconstruction from
BrhatkathaslOkasmgraha, PeruGkatai and Vasudevahimdi
PhD thesis, 1974, Univ. of Chicago
He published a peper in J. of Asian Studies (I think). Does anybody
have a reference? Is Dr. D. A. Nelson a faculty in a Asian studies dept?
2. R. Vijayalakshmy, A study of the Perunkatai, an authentic
version of the story of Udayana. IITS, 1981
