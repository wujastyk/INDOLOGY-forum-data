Itrans version 1.2b
The new 1.2b version of itrans appears to be great improvement on
the earlier version. I am attaching roman transliteration file (ribhu.txt)
I typed in and the Devanagari output (ribhu.rtf), which can be viewed in
Word with sanskrit 1.2 font, in the zip file ribhu.zip.
regards,
sarma.
