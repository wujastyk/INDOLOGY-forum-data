Suffixes and abstractions
Hi,
In addition to the Tulu example, Telugu has some abstractions:
e.g.,
illarikamu = family
Is the suffix -ik related to:
ig- (igy-) to separt from others leaving a space between (Kota)
or for e.g.to the -ka ending in:
ani_ka point, front, row (RV.) derived from ani_ point (Hindi_); an.i_
point (Gujara_ti_)
Regards,
k.
