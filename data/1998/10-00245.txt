C-DAC's new multilingual editor
I installed the software from CDROM in the October PCQuest magazine (India).
So if you purchase the magazine you can easily install it.
Otherwise you can try
http://www.cdac.org.in/download/gist/disclaim.htm
This is the URL of the site from which I downloaded the previous version
of Leap. You may have to start with home page.

sarma.
