><I remember well it looks not quadrangle, more 2

>>>        Can you give me a reference to any
source

>>>a good description of the dice typical of the
PGW

>        I think the dice mentioned in the answer
are typical both for
>IVC and Classical Indian culture (oblong,
quadrangle in section).
>But I meant the dice specific for PGW culture:
biconical, narrowing
>towards the ends. The one that I saw many years
ago (demonstrated by
>Prof. B.B.Lal) had been found at Noh. After that
I saw in archaeological
>reports one or two mentions of biconical dice
found at PGW sites, but no
>photo, drawing or a good description.
>        Mayby  somebody knows the address of
Prof. B.B.Lal? I sent a letter
>for him to the Archeological Survey of India, but
got no answer.
>        Thanks in advance.
