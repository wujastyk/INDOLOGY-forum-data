Q:Raghuuttama, the author of Bhaashyacandra
Dear Members,
does anybody of you know anything about Raghuuttama who wrote a
commentary on "Nyaayabhaashya" called "Bhaashyacandra"? He seems to
have lived between XIII and XVI cent. a.d. His work was published by
MM. G.Jha in Chowkhamba Sanskrit Series (No281) in 1920.
Thanks in advance.
Sincerely Yours, Dmitry Olenev
