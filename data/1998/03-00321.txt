Origins of Caste System in Ancient India
Dear Dr. Palaniappan,
For an excellany analysis of the Tamil and Telugu versions of this
ciRuttoNTar/siriyaaLa story, please check, Prof. Shulman's:
The hungry God : Hindu tales of filicide and devotion
Univ. of Chicago Press, 1993, Chicago
ISBN 0-226-75571-1
The well-known Telugu mediaeval poet; Srinaatha (14th century), while
creating; _haravilaasam_, his puranicized version of Saiva material
- drawn in part from (veeraSaiva poet) Paalkuriki sOmanaatha's work-
re-narrates the story in calm and harmonious fashion. Shulman compares
this (gruesome) story of "ciRuttoNTar/siriyaaLa" in Tamil, VeeraSaivaite
texts and in Srinatha's.
