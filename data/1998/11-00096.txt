Dr. H. M. Hubey attributes this to me.
I never wrote this. It is Prof. David W. Anthony's
article in the well-known "Antiquity".
I quoted verbatim Anthony's words and gave the reference.

[[Aside:
Many side-tracks that have come up were
given due consideration in Prof. Anthony's researches
for decades. He is an archaeologist too!]

I bet all or almost all Altaic languages have some word
like "radyo", "radiyo", "radio", "aradiyo" or something
like it for radio, but it hardly means that they invented
it or that they did not borrow the word.
