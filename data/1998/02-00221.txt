Chess in India
This from an old Indology posting. I think M. L. P. Patterson's
South Asian civilzations: A bibliographic synthesis and
Bibliography of Asian studies, annual volumes will have more
citations.

board-games: two articles
Two articles on "Sanskrit-studies and Board Games" appeared at a place where
Sanskritists interested in the subject will perhaps not start searching, viz.
in the IIAS Working Papers Series, vol. 3, New Approaches to Board Games
Research: Asian Origins and Future Perspectives. Editor: A.J. de Voogt.
Publisher: International Institute for Asian Studies, P.O. Box 9515, 2300 RA
Leiden.
The book contains the following parts:
I: Introducing Board Games; II: Descriptive Research and Board Games; III:
Archaeology and Board Games; IV: Sanskrit Studies and Board Games; V: Computer
Science and Board Games; VI: Philosophy and Board Games.
The articles in part IV are "The literary sources of Indian Chess and related
board games" by Andreas Bock-Raming, and "Antiquity of Indian Board Games - a
new approach" by C. Panduranga Bhatta. Unfortunately, the editor did not care
to get all diacritics of Sanskrit words right.
