What about OCR in the future? I saw once here about more
possible approach; instead of scanning, read it to a
computer. It will make a document. Using Verbot or something
like that. Doctors tell their instructions, IBM has a
product to convert into text files.

May be one day, we will be able to read an Indic text
to make it into a plain text file.

What is CDIAL? Never heard of it.
Is it a kind of historical dictionary?
For what Indian languages, CDIAL is available?
