  In Andhra, as has already been pointed out, there are many temples
which have a small mandapam where the 9 planets are enshrined with Surya
in the middle...This arrangement can be seen clearly ( among the
temples in the USA with which I'm familiar) in the Siva Vishnu Temple,
Lanham in the greater Washington DC area.

  In addition, there is a Rahu temple somewhere near KAlahasti,
Saturn worship in Mandapalli(East Godavari dist) and a Sun temple in
Arasavilli(Srikakulam dist)...

Regards,
Krishna
