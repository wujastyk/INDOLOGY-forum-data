Proposed changes to Velthuis Devanagari fonts.
Hi,
While on the subject of changes to the Velthuis Devanagari package, is there
any possibility of adding Vedic accents to it? This seems to be the only
thing missing from an otherwise perfect package. Alternatively, is there any
other package that can do it? I know it can be fudged into Itrans, but that
seems to be missing other stuff.
