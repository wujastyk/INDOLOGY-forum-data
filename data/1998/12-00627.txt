I'm a mere watcher usually, but I couldn't help but add this bit: heroic
epithets in other oral epics are often quite funny. I'm translating a
Tibetan epic, which quite irrevlantly to this point, has bits of Indian
epic in it, and the text is full of irony--- particularly with reference to
the heroes. You've got to remember that when epics are performed in
villages, people like to make fun of the great. Witness the satire and
irony that occur in village performances of Javanese Shadow Plays about
Indian epics.
