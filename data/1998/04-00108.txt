        Not Annasvami but Chinnasami Dikshitar. I do not know whether Ambi
        Dikshitar is also called Ambi Sastri. His real name Muddusvami
        Dikshitar named after his composer ancestor.

Ambi S'AstrI was a different person... he was also
a composer... his kritis in Sanskrit have been preserved
with text and notation on palm leaf manuscripts in the
Saraswati Mahal Library at Tanjore.  They were published
in book form a while ago.
