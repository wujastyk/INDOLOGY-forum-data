First grant competition, Seturaman Centre
My colleagues at MOZHI in Chennai have asked me to alert scholars to the
creation of the Professor Seturaman Centre for Culture Studies at MOZHI and
the Centre's first award of grants.  Support will be provided to complete a
manuscript in the fields of critical theory, literary criticism, or
translation studies.  More information is available at the following URL:
