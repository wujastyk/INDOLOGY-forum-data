>???From all that is unpeaceful he liberates
Those in whatever state-whether high, low or in between,
Whether peaceful or unpeaceful.
Homage to that Great Lord.

Through his distinctive, supreme compassion
He has utterly stolen away
All of birth's suffering --
I bow to that Thief.

The lord is replete with goodness;
He has given up thirsting for desire's waters -
I bow to the Great Lord
Who makes all beings blissful.
And since all follow him
He gathers all beings together; 
Desire's demon could not defeat him -
Homage to the conqueror of desire.

He is the good, Great Lord, 
The remover of sins -
Homage to the Great Lord
Who has promised to aid all beings.

Although he is harm's enemy,
Through love he is attached;
He has perfected all good qualities -
Homage to the Great Lord.

With a mere word  quickly he calms
Beings who are sorely afflicted
By astral misfortune, plague and poverty -
I bow to the Peaceful One.

Through whatever merit I might have gathered
By praising the lord of all
May the entire world
Become Great Lords of wisdom.
