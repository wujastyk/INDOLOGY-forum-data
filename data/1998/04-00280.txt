A somewhat similar motive is known in Greek legend, where Idomeneus
(returning from Troy) promises to sacrifice the first person he meets on the
beach after a ship-wreck to Neptun. The person turns out to be his son.
Mozart has made a wonderful opera on the basis of this theme (Idomeneo,
third act particularly recommended).
