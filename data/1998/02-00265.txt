Sources for Hindu divination
At the risk of providing information you haven't asked for I'd mention a
rather large volume on Jain divination:
        Angavijja / edited by Muni Punyavijaya.
        Varanasi : Prakrta grantha Parisad, 1957.
        (Prakrit Text Society series ; no.1).
It might be interesting to see if "Hindu" divination and "Jain" divination
have anything in common.
