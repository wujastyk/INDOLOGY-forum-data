Horses and chariots again
*The similarities between Sintasha burials and Vedic culture are not *so
convincing either. The RV references given by Genning in JIES
*article of late 70's seem too general to point especially to
*Sintasha burials.
  Genning has not specialized in the Vedas. He might have
  browsed Vedic translations intended for general public.
  Hope Vedicists take a close look at the Russian archaeological
  reports and give us new data.
