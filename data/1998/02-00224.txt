negations and their names
I have never come across the compound paryudaasa-pratis.edha in a
Sanskrit text, that is, in Buddhist writings on the subject-matter of
apoha or anupalabdhi, and in related discussions (about abhaava and
anupalabdhi) in Nyaaya or Miimaam.saa-treatises.
It seems to me that the lexical asymmetry between the two technical
terms
paryudaasa and prasajyapratis.edha was definitely perceived, and
occasionally deemed problematic. However, the commonly followed strategy
to
balance it out was cutting off the "pratis.edha" of prasajyapr. (which
leads to constructions such as "paryudaasapaks.e ...., prasajyapaks.e tu
...", or other occurrences of "prasajya" in the sense of
"prasajyapratis.edha"). The other option, that is, adding "pratis.edha"
to "paryudaasa", does not seem to have been realized.
The Tibetan translations "ma yin dgag" and "med dgag" (for
paryudaasa/prasajyapratis.edha) are based on conceptual content rather
than on an analysis of the terms into component parts, and I think
Katsura is justified in considerind MVy 'paryudaasa-pratis.edha' as a
retranslation (and not a good one at that).
It might be of interest that Prof. Kajiyama has raised the same question
at the last Dharmakiirti-conference (November last year in Hiroshima),
and to my
recollection, nobody could come up with a reference for
"paryudaasapratis.edha".
