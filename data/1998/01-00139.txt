Vedic sacrifice
While there is no shortage of eulogies to water/aapas in the Vedic
material, and its ritual purification role is well-attested, I am curious
as to any mythology and liturgy as regards offerings of water--how are
they performed and under what circumstances?  I know that Agni is
well-associated wtih water with regard to hiding there (RV 10.51.3, or
coming from tehre 10.45.1), but is there anything else?  Preferably from
Early Vedic ritual rather than the later periods.
thanks in advance, and Happy Martin Luther King Day to those folks knowing
of it!

It is ludicrous to consider language as anything other
