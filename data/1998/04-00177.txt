I read some years ago in The Economist (I think) that about a 100 people
were "sacrificed" in India every year. Considering that India has a
population of about 900 million people, I think the right reference here is
not "history of religion" but psychopathology. Compare weird religious acts
in Christian extremist sects, as well as other non-Christian extreme sects
in the West.
