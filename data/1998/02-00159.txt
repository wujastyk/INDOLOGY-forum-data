Budha epithet
There is an epithet of the graha Budha,
        piya"ngugulikaabhaasa
that seems to mean the "One with the
appearance of balls of priya"ngu."  According
to Apte's Sankrit dictionary priya"ngu is
a kind of millet.  Perhaps "balls" refers to
the shape of millet grain.
Can someone confirm that priya"ngu grain is
green in color?
