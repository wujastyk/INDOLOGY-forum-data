Hello
Thanks for all your replies regarding the question about the Harappan
theory.

Thanks, I'll check it out.
I can tell you are a skecptic too, but I have to admit that the
professer(s) whichever one they were, made some valid points about the
theory (still looking for the page!) Though it might not be correct to say
that the Aryan Invasions are false, there are holes in the theory as
pointed out by the author of the page.
Disclaimer :^) - I mean no insult whatsoever to the above mentioned (and I
didn't call him/them a "loser")

I'm glad you liked it. One of the reasons I've subscribed to this list is
that I will soon be adding (hopefully large) section about the armies of
ancient India. I'll check out your page later today.
Just one question, (actually two) how did the name for the city "Harappa"
come about? And if the Aryan's really pushed the original inhabitants of
India back to what is now south India (as the AIT states), why whould there
be a festival comemmerating the arrival of raiders? I believe I've wasted
enough of everyones time now,
