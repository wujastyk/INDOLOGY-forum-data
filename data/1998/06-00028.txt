My undergraduate mentor, Boyd H. Wilson, who is responsible for my current
Iowa residence as he did his Ph.D. here, wrote about Shankara's commentary
style in no small detail.  I think his diss can be accessed by
interlibrary loan.  Boyd is currently at Hope College, in Holland, MI.

buying.  So you can take the offer as a compliment. . . . "
