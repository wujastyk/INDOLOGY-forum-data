literature on commentarial style
My undergraduate mentor, Boyd H. Wilson, who is responsible for my current
Iowa residence as he did his Ph.D. here, wrote about Shankara's commentary
style in no small detail.  I think his diss can be accessed by
interlibrary loan.  Boyd is currently at Hope College, in Holland, MI.

"Now, at some point you may encounter the Devil's Bargain.  Any old soul
is worth saving, at least to a priest, but not every soul is worth
buying.  So you can take the offer as a compliment. . . . "
