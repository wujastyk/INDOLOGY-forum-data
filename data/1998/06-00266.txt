This is very debatable. It is not right to say that India does not have
linguistic diversity !!. The range of languages in India is mind boggling.
Actually, the presence of Kentum traces in some of the Indian languages,
that has been suggested by Zoller isnt much of a surprise to Indigenists.
Also, it wouldnt be surprising at all if more Kentum traces are found in
the Dardic, Kafir and other languages in N.India.
