Sankaracarya of the North
I haven't followed this.  But couldn't understand the implication
of this posting.
Is this to understand:
a) the succession of Sankaracharyas is a political affair
b) India judicial system is corrupt
c) some shaven head people have more ego than humility
what is the research?
