References from these would be a good starting point. The classical
reference is
Sivaism and Vishunism, by Jan Gonda
though the references here are a bit dated. You could also try
Medeival Religious Literature in Sanskrit, by Jan Gonda, Chapters I, X,
XI, XII, XIII for some general material about North Indian Saivism.
A book which I haven't read yet is Vaishnavism, Saivism and minor
religious systems, by Sir R. G. Bhandarkar. Of course the references
here must be pretty old also.
