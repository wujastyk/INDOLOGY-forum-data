hi,
let me add my two cents worth, clustering CDIAL and DEDR.

root: udan water (RV.); udaga water (Pkt.); u_ water (Burusha_ski).
udanya_ thirst (ChUp.) anudra waterless; udrin abounding in water
(RV.) ulla wet (Pkt.) ul.a mud (Ma.) but, u_l.a_ a carnivorous marine
fish (Ta.)

samudda large river, sea (Pali); sodo bha_sa_na boat festival, lit.
launching at sea; muhuda ocean (OSi.)

Are we dealing with lakes formed in the marshes of the Rann? or even
close to the legendary Nal lake in Saura_s.t.ra which linked Kotda
(Dholavira) and Lothal?
British India gazetteers refer to the Nal lake expanding north- and
south-wards cutting off the peninsula from Ahmedabad during monsoons.
See the map in S.R. Rao's Lothal report.

Regards,
K.
