In one of the two Sri Vaishnavite devotional traditions, the love of a cat for
its kitten is compared to the love of God for the devotee. (The cat grabs its
kitten by the mouth and carries it in contrast to the situation involving a
female monkey and its baby  where it is the responsibility of the baby monkey
to hold on to its mother.)
