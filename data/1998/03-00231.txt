Robert,
It's useful in a debate to comment on a person's work rather
than the person himself/herself.  By using strong language against
individuals we would simply sidetrack and get into emotional
exchanges.  I thought strong language against Swami Vivekananda
is not necessary to make a point in this forum.  For many people
in the world (including me!) he was a genius ..

During the debate, personalities (past and present) would show up.
It would be healthy not to use the "attack" mode, but a "critic" mode.

Regards,

Bijoy Misra
