SV: Against Aryan Invasions
article.
What kind of evidence are the above based on? This seems to be another kind
of baseless theory? If this is being taught in Indian schools, the students
are the losers. Two wrongs do not make a right.
Veering off topic, in most videos on evolution (of course these are backed
by years of research and renowned scientists) out of Africa the early man is
always dark with no sharp features (i.e., more negroid)  whereas the modern
man is fair, tall, sharp featured (i.e., more caucasian). To me these
programs seem to be spreading a subtle message that negroid=less evolved.
Has anyone noticed this? Does it bother you?
