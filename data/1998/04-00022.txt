But then you have civilizations like those in Mesoamerica and Ponape
which vanish due to geological/climatic change.  The Sahara was once
a fairly populated and wet region until weather changes caused mass
migrations.
More like remains of deserted cities.
And related to languages spoken within the country.
But not about origin elsewhere.  In fact, all the peoples in the
Vedas are already situated in India. The destruction of cities comes
from warfare between different kingdoms in India.
Nor an "Aryan" cultural complex.  Or even an "Aryan" skeletal series in
a relevant time period.
Nor of Kurgan or other Central Asian complexes.
Not anymore so than most people.  Remember the subcontinent has had
almost continuous strife since WWII.  At least four major
insurgencies, and cold/hot conflicts between India and Pakistan and
internally in Sri Lanka.
