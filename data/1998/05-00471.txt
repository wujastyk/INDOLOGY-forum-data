The Indus and the Sarasvati
Hi,
This is the title of a 5-page article which appeared
in the Frontline of 22 May 1998. I will be happy to
forward this to anyone interested. The article is
by Dr. Ram Sharan Sharma, former Chairman of the Indian
Council of Historical Research. This seeks to refute the views of
"religious fundamentalists who want to establish the superiority of
the Sarasvati over the Indus", to quote from a blurb.
I can email this in pdf format (1.3mb) or as five jpg or gif files
(1.47mb). Please let me know your preference.
Regards,
Kalyanaraman
