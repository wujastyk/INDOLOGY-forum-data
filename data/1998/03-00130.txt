It seems to be they don't like to preserve memories and/or facts of
previous troublesome ages, which are not shaping well

It resembles situation with break down of Sovietology Studies in the West
after decay of SU, when suddenly emerged decades of Eastern European
and Central Asian Independent Countries-with need to be studied out of
communist context. Manifolds of languages and cultures NOT-KNOW well before.
And not so easy to know also. So, what was the wise decision: just to curtail
any studies on that region,or in a better case to extinct them down to level
of only Russia Studies with relative funding cut.
