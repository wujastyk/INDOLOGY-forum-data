gender and Grammar
There's a delightful and (deliberately?) very funny discussion of
grammatical gender in Patanjali's Mahabhasya.  It's a very long time since
I read it, but I recall him arguing that something is feminine in
grammatical gender as long as it has breasts and long hair.  But why are
these features not seen in a bed (kha.tvaa, f.).  Answer: they are
present, but are invisible.  :-)
I've always slept more contentedly since reading that argument.
All the best,
Dominik
