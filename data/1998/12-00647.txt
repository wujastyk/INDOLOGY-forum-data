pots, brahmin names, and potters
If this indeed were true, how come the sudden outburst ? I guess you
interviewed a lot of people who told you of the treachery of the Sankara
Matths all over India. Indeed, everyday, several hundred thousand people
are brainwashed into going to the different Tirtha-Dhams and Sankara Matths
and offering prayers, money and political patronage !!! That is some
conclusion.

I doubt if you have studied people of India.  Books don't
say what people think.  I suggest that you go and visit
the villages.  You would discover.  Interview as many
people as you can to get a sample.
  I spent many decades in village India, interviewed
  several people all across India for years.
