This may be partially true.

But,I must say that it is the Europeans who have had more problems
with perceptions about their identity - especially with their jewish
heritage and religion.
Thankfully, more scholars in the U.S  are realizing that as well.

By focussing and looking at only the Indian people, there is a tendency
to label and attribute motives. Why isnt anyone looking at the German
interest in Indian studies ? Is it because somehow that Germans and European
scholars in general do not have any biases and only Indians do ?

Why should it be - that it is always the Indian people who should be
observed and the Europeans the observers ?
It is high time that the motives of eurocentric academics be studied and
commented upon.

Again,I repeat, please look up the Spring/Summer98 issue of JIES to see
who has identity problems. It is European academia that is paranoid about
the so called
Indo-European people - because of obvious identity questions.
