*The following verse (from Umaa's impassioned defence of "Siva) is 5:78
*(in Naaraaya.namuurti's edition with the commentary of Vallabhadeva)
*of Kaalidaasa's Kumaarasambhava:---

*tada"ngasa.mspar"sam avaapya kalpate dhruva.m citaabhasmarajo vi"suddhaye|
*tathaa hi n.rttaabhinayakriyaacyutam vilipyate maulibhir ambaraukasaam|| 78||
          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

     Thanks for the reference. Is this in a kind of critical edition
     of kumaarasambhava. Will check into Hank Heifetz's translation
     which I have.

*Chapter 162 (verses 26ff) of the Ur-Skandapuraa.na---which, according
*to the revised opinion of the team of scholars now editing it, may
*date from as early as the 6th century---describes "Siva's dancing,
*imitated first by the goddess, then Nandin and then his attendants.

*The text was first edited by Bha.t.taraaii and published under the
*title <Skandapuraa.nasya Ambikaakha.n.da.h> from Kathmandu in 1988.
*Adriaensen, Bakker and Isaacson, in an article entitled `Towards a
*Critical Edition of the Skandapuraa.na' (Indo-Iranian Journal 37,
*1994, pp.325--31), argue convincingly that the text in question is the
*original Skandapuraa.na.  The first volume of their edition is due to
*appear in the course of the year.

     Thanks again. But Nataraja theme appears much more widely
     in Tamil from earlier times. Refer aaDavallaan by ca. taNTapaaNi
