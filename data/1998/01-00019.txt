Switchover from palm leaves to paper
Ruth has brought up an important question.  I am not sure if writing on
palm leaves was completely abandoned.  When I was a highschool student in
Pune, our drawing teacher, who had beautiful Devanagari handwriting, was
contracted by a Jain establishment to make copies of old manuscripts on
palm leaves, and I have seen him writing on palm leaves.  Of course, the
use of palm leaves as the primary material was discontinued a long time
ago.
        All the best,
                                        Madhav Deshpande
