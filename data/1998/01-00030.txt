sva
If sva as a "reflexive pronoun" works just like aatman, then singular
sva should allow plural and dual antecedents, e.g. svam parirakSanti,
like aatmaanam parirakSanti.  It should also occur in the nominative,
e.g. svaH parirakSitum zakyate, like aatmaa parirakSitum zakyate.
Are these usages of sva attested?
