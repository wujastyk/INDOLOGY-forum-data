Subject: CSX+: final draft
Message-ID: <161227040982.23782.10821378120684932254.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

This message is being posted to both the Indology and Conv-dev mailing
lists. Apologies to those who receive it twice.

Some weeks ago I announced a proposal for an enhanced version of the
CSX character set, to be named CSX+: the aim was to provide a broadly
CSX-compatible encoding containing a number of new characters whose
absence in CSX had caused problems to users. Specifically, it was
proposed that CSX+ should implement all the characters required by the
draft ISO/TC46/SC2 standard for transliteration of Indian languages:
this has been under discussion for the past year on the conv-dev
mailing list, and is now nearing completion.

Recent contributions to the conv-dev discussion have made it
impossible to finalise CSX+ until now, since significant changes to
the draft standard have continued to be debated. However, it does now
appear that a broad consensus may have been reached, and I think the
time has come to agree a definitive version of the encoding.

The attached file contains the proposed definition of the CSX+
character set. It differs in three respects from the previous version:
(1) character 156 is now e-macron-tilde, not sterling (pound sign);
(2) character 180 is now m-breve, not l-underring-acute; (3) character
192 is now o-macron-tilde, not M-overdot. The characters sacrificed
appear to me to be the most readily disposable ones, and their
replacements are necessary: m-breve is used for the Sinhalese
half-nasal before a labial, and e-macron-tilde and o-macron-tilde are
required for citing forms from northern Indian languages in a southern
(or pan-Indian) context.

I would welcome comments on this final draft of the CSX+ "standard".
Assuming it meets with general approval, I shall release a set of
fonts implementing it in about one week's time.

# CSX+ encoding for mkt1font and vpl2vpl
#
# Enhanced version of CSX (Classical Sanskrit eXtended encoding)
# for the representation of Indian languages in Roman script
#
# CSX+ aims to be downward compatible with CSX, save for moving aacute
# away from the slot (decimal 160) used as non-breaking space on PCs.
# It also seeks to implement the (draft) ISO/TC46/SC2 standard, while
# retaining a useful set of European accented characters and adding
# dashes and directional double quotes.
