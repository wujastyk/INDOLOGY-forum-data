Beginning Sanskrit: A practical course based on graded reading and
exercises.

By Dermot Killingley, revised by Dermot Killingley and Siew-Yue
Killingley.

Three volumes.

Vol I 1996. ISBN 3 89586 062 X. USD 42 / DM 56 / stg 23.60.
Vol II in press; vol. III in preparation.

The aim of the course is to develop reading ability. Each of the 65 lessons
contains explanation, oral practice, a passage for reading, and written
exercises. Devanagari is introduced in Lessons 23-27, and is used from
then on in all the reading passages; roman script is used thoughout in
the explanations, practice sentences and exercises. The grammatical
terminology of modern Sanskrit scholarship has been adapted to conform
with linguistic theory.
