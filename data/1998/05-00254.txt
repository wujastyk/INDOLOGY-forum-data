Maybe it is not out of place here to mention that Basava's a:nkita is not "kuu.dalasa:ngamee;svara", as a few list members have been writing, but "kuu.dalasa:ngamadeeva". :-) (The meaning may not differ much, but I think that we ought to get such details right.)

"Kuu.dalasa:ngama" is of course a hybrid tautological name. As has been pointed out earlier, it _is_ topographical (and there are Kannada sources for finding out that, so we don't need Tamil sources from far away, although of course it is nice to know that such exist too). If the name of the place is that tautology, then one can hardly blame a learned person like Basava for using it, because that is simply the way it is. If we had no other sources that tell us about the existence of such a place, then Basava's using of such an odd word would in itself already have been an indication that it was a locally existing name.
