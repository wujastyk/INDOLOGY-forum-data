Dear members of the net:

I have a question regarding the use of Sanskrit by the Hindutva people. I (believe I) know that the VHP has published a major political program document in Sanskrit. Are there any more such documents published in Skt., or other political tracts, and where would they be available?

Best regards,

Lars Martin Fosse
