Subject: Inscriptions and Dravidian sound changes "y" > "c" and "y" > "t"

Regarding the Dravidian y/c/s alternation, at 01:41 19/01/98 EST, Dr. Bh.
Krishnamurti wrote:

<<Coming to kuyawa~kucawa, an intervocalic consonant is weakened and not
strengthened by a natural phonetic process. -c- [-s-] thus gets weakened to
-y- and not the other way round.>>

But this is not as universal a process as it is made out to be. According to
the conventional weakening hierarchy of sound change as shown by Hans H. Hock
in Principles of Historical Linguistics, 1991, p.83, the voiceless stops and
voiced stops exemplified by "t" and "d" are higher in the weakening hierarchy
than "y". If this hierarchy were to apply strictly and universally, proto-
Dravidian "-y-" cannot have a reflex "-j-" which is a voiced stop. But this is
precisely what the comparative Dravidianists posit in the case of Kui which
Dr. Krishnamurti seems to accept (Pr. Dr. *kay > Kui kaju). Given this, there
seemed to be no reason to believe in the one-way change proposed by
Krishnamurti and Subrahmanyam. A two-way alternation as suggested by G.
Sambasiva Rao seemed to be the correct one.

Indeed, my examination of inscriptional evidence showed irrefutable evidence
for y > c. To prove my case, I have to show that a "y" reconstructable to
Proto-Dravidian should change to "c" in a medial position.

Consider the following case.
matacAn2ai (SII, vol. 5, no. 431 ) < matayAn2ai

The compound "matayAn2ai" is composed of "mata"+"yAn2ai". It means rutting
elephant. "mata" (DEDR 4687) means "to be furious as by must" and "yAn2ai"
