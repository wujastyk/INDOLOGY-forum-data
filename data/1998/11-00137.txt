        Just a remark. The few we know about the Goddess Turan shows that
She is the Etruscan equivalent of the Latin Venus and the Greek Aphrodite
and nothing else. Hence, surely not a "fertility Goddess"! Assuming a link
between Turan and "birth and begetting" shows the same flimsiness than,
phonetically, between 'tur' and 'tuw'.

PS: The confusion between love and fertility is probably a common idea in
some monotheistic religions, but Greeks and Romans made a clear difference
between the both ;-)
