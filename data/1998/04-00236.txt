Dear Dr. Krishnamurti,
In a message dated 98-01-19 03:50:58 EST, you write:

<< Also notice that the contracted form of
 kuyawa occurs as ko: within Ta.Kota, Toda and Kannada. Emeneau derives the
 name Kota from the potter word, ko:v 'a Kota man'. >>

Do you have the reference for this work by Emeneau?

Regards
S. Palaniappan
