Hello Dominique!

I share your frustrations.

When I went to the URL, I started receiving what were "advertistisements".
Perhaps this web page is hosted on one of those "free" servers because the
author cannot afford it or is unable to host it elsewhere? This could be a
real problem in third world countries.

It would be instructive to contact the author and find out.
