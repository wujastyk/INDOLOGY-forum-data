I am not aware of this particular article. However, I am aware of a very useful and extremely good book that addresses this topic. The author traces various origins including the "Sutrya Siddhanta", etc. He weaves an interesting description around the ancient philosophical expositions and quite interestingly relates to the psyche of Indian Scientists : Ramanujan, Raman, Chandrasekhar, George Sudarshan.


It is : 

--- Anil Kumar Sarkar, "ZERO : Its Role and Prospects in Indian Thought"., South Asia Publishers, New Delhi.

I can give complete details if you are interested. This book is very much in print. I myself have a copy.

I hope this has been useful.

Best Regards,
Sreenivasa

Anyone knows about a Suniti Kumar Chatterji article that addresses the
origin of SUnya-zero, published-most probably in an Indian Journal-in
the sixties ?
