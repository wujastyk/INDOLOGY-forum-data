Tamil Pronunciation
+But, there is no "sa" in thamiz. Is there some rule for changing ca to sa also?
+The most common example is paci (hunger). I have never heard it being
+pronounced as paci. And isn't it an original thamiz word, I mean not a loan
+from the Sanskrit?
I already wrote that "North of Madurai, c is pronounced as s".
North of Madurai, 'paci' is spoken as 'pasi' (hunger).
'col' (to tell, word) is spoken as 'sol'.
But note that if doubling c occurs, it is told as such.
'paccai' is spoken as 'paccai'.
