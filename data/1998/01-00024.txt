jogayara in Samavayanga-suttam?
In the Ardha-Magadhi dictionary the only source cited for the item
yogaayaara (= yogaacaara) is Sama 1, which according to my understanding of
the abbreviations means Samavaayaanga-suttam. In the edition I have (Jaina
Agama Series 3), however, that term is not listed in the extensive index.
Am I making some mistake somewhere, or what *is* the story here?  This is
apparently (if it exists) the only occurence of the term in (at least
canonical?) Ardha-Magadhi, so I am eager to track it down. Any help much
appreciated!
