Well, mythology can be used in myriad ways. But we must remember that
Pharas is mentioned even in the cilappatikAram (if its identification
with the takkeSi paN is correct), so it is not all that foreign to
Carnatic music. In any case, UttukkADu venkaTasubbaiyar, a pre-dIkshitar
composer has also composed in Pharas. In contrast, dvijAvantI is a more
'foreign' rAga, which was first introduced to Carnatic music by
muttusvAmi dIkshitar.
