Verse that influenced M. GANDHI
Dear Netters,
could any knowledgeable person help me with identifying the source
of the following quotation, a verse that is said to have influenced
young Gandhi's views?
"But the truly noble know all men are one
And return with gladness good for evil done."
Gratefully Yours, J.F.
