The recent discussion of Siva's earrings prompts me to ask a question.

In "The Wonder that was India" Basham writes of Indian plastic arts that
they exhibit "horror vacuii" or "fear of blank spaces". Of course, this is
a rather perjorative way of putting it.

I seek a parallel Indian aesthetic term for the impulse to ornament, or the
desirability of alamkar. If any body can point me to a source, I would be
most grateful.
