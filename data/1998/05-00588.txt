 Perhaps it is not too late to respond to this interesting question.

 Since my own interest is Vedic, particularly the RV, most of these notes
 are focussed there [I apologize if this has little reference to the Magadha
 / Bihar area].  >>

It will be useful to know why a bard called mAgadha (name supposedly derived
from magadha) is used in the sacrificial rituals supposedly of pre-Vedic
origins as discussed by Parpola? To put it in other words why a bard is called
mAgadha in the first place? Secondly, why is a mAgadha used as opposed to a
sUta?
