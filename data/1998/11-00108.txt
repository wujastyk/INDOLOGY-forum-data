Indeed.  But you can't dismiss Sogdian that way.  First, we're not
talking about a few inscriptions or documents here, but about a whole
literature, written down in three distinct scripts (native Sogdian
script [from which the Uighur and Mongolian scripts are derived],
Manichean Syriac script, and Christian Nestorian script).  Second,
unlike Arabic, Sogdian documents are found in Central Asia only,
nowhere else.  They can't be foreign imports.  Third, a language
demonstrably descended from Sogdian, Yaghnobi, is spoken today in
Central Asia. Fourth, the Turkic languages spoken in Central Asia
today (Uighur and Uzbek, among others), show plenty of borrowings
from old Sogdian.
