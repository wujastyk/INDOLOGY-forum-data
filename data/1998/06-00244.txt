Well, this is not the first time. They tried doing that in 1977-80 too
when they re-wrote the school history textbooks. Many school teachers
at that time agreed that the new textbooks, which now had a pronounced
saffron aspect, were nowhere near the old ones even in terms of
production quality, leave alone in terms of presenting Indian history
as accepted by a majority of scholars.

This has some relevance for recent discussion in this forum as the
Cambridge History of India and the Bharatiya Vidya Bhawan histories
have rightly been deplored by some eminent ZiSTAs (although the
recommended alternative is not without problems viz., Kulke-Rothemund
with its  Kossinna-esque terminology like "Indo-Germans"). Well, you
ain't seen nothin' yet! Wait for their new volumes on Indian history.

I guess this would mean that Saraswati will now begin to overflow
(with funds) and we may truthfully say naditame!

On a lighter note, the impact of this on the dating of the RV will be
immediate. It will be dated to ca. 10,000 BC at least.

Warm Regards.
