The south Asian bombs
It is now almost three weeks after Pokhran-II, and a day after the most
recent test in Chagai. I've seen no direct reference to the nuclear
testing on this list. Maybe Sarasvati and Dravidian etymology are
explosive enough for us here. Maybe the bomb is not one of the issues
that Indology should bother about.
If so, it would be much appreciated if indirect references to it,
frequently in a negative/contemptuous tone, are also avoided. If there
is to be any talk about the bombs, let it be done directly and in the
open. The ten (or eleven) explosions in south Asia have brought us no
further into Kaliyuga than the thousands of explosions that preceded
them elsewhere in the world. And unbelievable as it may seem, a
substantial portion (or all) of the newest Indian and Pakistani bombs is
due to domestic expertise, and in spite of Western opposition, not due
to any great assistance. This might be a bizarre thing to be proud of,
but such is international politics.
