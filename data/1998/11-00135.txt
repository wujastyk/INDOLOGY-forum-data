Paired Horse and PIE breakup

This could be a time effect, or a substratum effect depending on
the observable facts.
I can only give an example.
Suppose an airplane flies from Oslo to Malta. IT starts at 9:00 AM
and lands at Malta airport at 12:00. Suppose we put a temperature
sensor on the airplane that records the ambient temperature. We later
look at the change of temperature during this trip. There are two
parts to this change. One part is a temporal effect and the other
is a spatial effect. The temporal effect is due to the fact that
it is colder at 9:00 AM than at 12:00. Even if the plane stood still
in Oslo it would have recorded this change. The second is due to the
spatial effect. IT is due to the fact that it is warmer in the south.
Now, the spatial temperature change depends on the velocity of the
plane.
The faster this plane travels, the greater it records the change in the
spatial temperature gradient over the north-south axis.
So if Hittite and Greek and Sanskrit are not from exactly the same
time period and did not have exactly the same substratum, it is
difficult
to make judgements for these effects. One would have to "normalize" the
data to account for the effects of the substratum (spatial) and
the effects of the time difference (temporal).
In the case of the airplane, it is easy because it is called the
hyrodynamic or total derivative and is given by a neat formula of
calculus. In order to apply this idea to language we have to fix
up a few things which are not too clear.
I made a separate post on the effects of the rising sea levels.
It takes a little time for info of this sort to diffuse from science
journals into linguistics.
It could have been carried as a technological innovation by anyone,
including a branch of IE.
One of my teachers played this "joke" on us a long time ago.
        I have four bottles labeled A, B, C and X.
        I mix A & X and drink and get drunk.
        I mix A & Y and drink and get drunk.
        I mix A & Z and drink and get drunk.
What can you say?
Most people would say that X has alcohol.
But what if A, B and C are vodka, whiskey, and brandy and X is
just coke?
It is not necessary to have the cart at the time of dispersal
if there ever was such a thing.
Doesn't this sound a little like Sumerian gigir? gigir=kwekwel=kekel?
Of course. Why not?
Best Regards,
Mark
