Linguistics
It looks like Subrahmanya besides having some peculiar
ideas about linguistics also has his very own notion of
netiquette: my statement he quoted was from a personal
email where I was trying to show him rationally (I guess
I should've known better) why an excerpt from Rajaram's
book contained another probable piece of disinformation.
