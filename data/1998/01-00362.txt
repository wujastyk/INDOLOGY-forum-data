For those interested, Roerich's collection is housed and on display at the
Karnataka Chitrakala Parishath in Bangalore. The Parishath is located  in
the "Art Complex" on Kumara Krupa Rd. B'lore 560 001 and, incidentally,
houses several other interesting collections including one of "Mysore
School" paintings and one of leather shadow puppets from Karnataka.

The General Secretary, Mr. M. S. Nanjunda Rao (Tel.. 226 1816) was most
gracious when I visited the  Parishath in January of 1997 and I am sure he
would be happy to show the collections to any interested scholars.
