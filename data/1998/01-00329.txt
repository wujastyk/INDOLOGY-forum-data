The Cat
I would like to add support to Gopal's statement from the experience of my
own family.  Since my grand-mother's time, we always had cats in the
family, and I, as well as my wife, practically grew up with cats.  We have
continued to have cats here in Michigan.  The first thing my daughter did
last year after she got married is to go and get a cat.  Growing up in
Pune in the Brahmin community, it was more common to have cats as pets
than dogs.
