"tittiyam" looks to me rather like derived from a Prakrit form "titthiya"
from skt. "tIrthika", derived from "tIrtha"; see Apte, Skt.-Engl. Dict.,
s.v. tIrtham, 20: "(in liturgical language) The path to the altar between
the cAtvAla and the utkara." In Pali, you find "tittika" in the expression
"samatittika" ("brimful", of a river); the word is also written "-titthika"
which is clearly derived from "tIrtha". The loss of the aspiration in Pali
might be due to Dravidian influence? The word appears also in Vinaya texts,
both in Pali and Sanskrit, see Edgerton, Buddh. Hybrid Skt Dict., s.v.
samatIrthika. In the PrAtimokSasUtra of the SarvAstivAdins I meet (in just
one ms.) the form "samatittik(am)" which I translate (following Edgerton):
"(the alms bowl filled) with food to the brim".
