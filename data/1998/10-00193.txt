Subject: "crookednes" of the courtyard

Almost all Hindi dialects have this proverb, though the following form has
become somewhat "standard" in written Hindi:

naac na jaane (aave) aaNgan TeRHaa.

Some other dialectal variants are:

naac = naacibau, nacibo
na = naa, nii, kuNi, koni
jaane = jaaNe
aave = aabe, aabai
aaNgan = aNgnaa, aaNgnaa, aaNgaN
TeRHaa = TeRHo, TeDo, TaiRHyo, TeDyo etc.

(randomly arranged)

Like all proverbs this one too may have different meanings according to the
context in which it is used. Nevertheless, I will stick with the "ordinary"
meaning of the proverb, i.e.:

One (she/he/they/you) doesn't know how to dance, yet blames the
"crookedness" of the courtyard.

(I don't know if it makes any sense in English.)
