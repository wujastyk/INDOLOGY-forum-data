Sarasvati (texts & arch.II)
Hi,
I am fascinated by and agree with Sarma's views.
I have been brought up right from grade 1 to college level in
Penukonda, Anantapure district, studying in Telugu medium. It is a
strong tradition in Andhra to call place names ending with -samudram
any town supported by a lake. Even in Penukonda (which was the second
capital of the Vijayanagara kingdom with a fort and all that) at the
foothills of the mountain, 5 miles from the town, is a lake called
samudram which served the drinking water needs of the entire town. As
in Rajasthan, so in Penukonda, I had a routine chore to help my mother
by carrying on my shoulder pots of drinking water walking 5 miles to
the samudram. The point is: samudram is not necessarily a salty ocean.
[Aside; a joke: I have often wondered if a popular etymology may be
suggested! sa-mudra; were the ancestors of these people near the
samudra's using seals?]
How do the texts differentiate between samudra and sa_gara?
Regards,
K.
such> tradition of calling lkakes as 'samudram' existed in the RV times.
