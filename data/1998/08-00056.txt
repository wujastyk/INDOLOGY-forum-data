Cloning
Does any one know of any concept similar to cloning as we know it from the
recent modern scientific experiment in the Hindu mythological,
philosophical or Vedic materials. Secondly, any views on this as to how
Hindus would respond to such a concept? Your responses would be most
valuable for me. Thanks in advance.
