It cannot function as a dative, because it occupies the specifier-of-sentence position, in other words, it occupies the subject position. In English, which hardly has case-features, word order plays a decisive role. In German, which has case, word order plays a much smaller role in determining the role of a word or phrase.

In my opinion, b indeed is not exactly the same as d. But there is more: a is not the equivalent in meaning of b, and c not of d. To stick to the German: `ein Freund' is not necessary the friend of the favoured man (`dem Mann'), while `einem Freund' sounds more like a real friend of the man in question (`dem Mann). You see, meaning has changed, so apparently the underlying structures differ a bit. As to your question, is not `ein Buch' denn in d der Subjekt? Is it not just an example of scrambling? Scrambling to the left of the dative (not the locative)? Or can you equally say in German

e) Den Maennern wurden von einem Freund ein Buch gegeben.

Ich denke nein. I think e) is not grammatical, while f) is:

f) Dem Mann wurden von einem Freund einige Buechern gegeben.

In f) the books (`einige Buechern') are the subject, in e) the man (`den maennern').

Or am I totally wrong in my knowledge of German?

Is it possible that Netscape is the bad guy (in general, I am AGAINST Microsoft!), as I have a  friend who also uses Netscape, and she, too, receives the attachments?
