Romantic India -Reply
Holst's Savitri is a brief opera in English.  I can tell it is brief because in
looking at a sample of the 36 hits for author Holst and title Savitri on OCLC
it is usually just part of a single disk or tape.  I don't have access to any
online audio catalog so don't know if it's currently available.  Amazon.com
has just brought up an audio section but doesn't include classical music yet.
