[Apology to members] Was: Web Site Hosting
Further to the ROCKLAND incident, it now appears that the perpetrator
joined INDOLOGY, posted the spam, and then unsubscribed.  This is more
callous than we had at first realized, and has resulted in the perp. being
banned from any future membership of the list.  The listserv operators are
pursuing this person, with a view to instigating punitive procedures.
I and the Liverpool support team take this sort of misuse of the list
rather seriously.
All the best,
Dominik
