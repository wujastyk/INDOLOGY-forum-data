A question on Jain temples
Dr. Claus,
In a message dated 98-05-23 13:41:54 EDT, you write:
<< Yes, they are (ARE, in coastal Karnataka, at least, where there are many
 active Jain temples [basadi]) called Indras. >>
It is not clear for me if you mean these Indras are priests or administrators?
Can you clarify? Thanks.
Regards
S. Palaniappan
