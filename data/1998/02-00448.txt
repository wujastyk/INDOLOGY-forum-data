Authorship of Sarvadarzanasamgraha

Certainly I agree with that. But, it seems I have a different version
of the sarvadarshanasa.ngraha than others! But, at least in my copy,
the author follows this method of exposition. He points out some
defect of darshana A and gives darshana B which removes that
defect. But then he points out some defect in darshana B and gives
darshana C and so on. The list (at least in my copy!) ends with
yoga. nyAyA is much before that. And then of course (in my copy) he
says the _crest jewel of all systems_, advaita, has been explained
elsewhere by him!  So you see why I thought the author must have been
an advaitin. However, it seems there are multiple versions of the same
text floating around.
Not so. If you see the some jaina texts (of the sarva darshana
sa.ngraha type), they describe the nyAya authors as pAshupata-s in
practice. References can be found in Dasgupta's (Vol 5 I think, not
sure). This is not a well known fact, but most nyAyA authors were
pAshupatas in practice. Further, they do accept and worship
Ishvara. So I fail to see why it is not "spiritual".
