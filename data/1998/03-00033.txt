Forms of "Dharmaguptaka" in inscriptions

I have been in Oxford where I found Shizutani (with difficulty). It is
indeed useful and would have been worth buying, were it in print.
Yes, I think you are right. This all evidences Middle Indian forms
equivalent to -aya (or -iya).  Had it been the other way (i.e. some form in
early inscriptions like dhamauta-), then that would have been strong
support  for an original name equivalent to Pali Dhammagutta-.
Yet, Bareau says that the form Dharmagupta is frequent (Sectes, p. 190: On
le trouve souvent ?crit Dharmagupta . . .).  Probably, he is referring to
Chinese sources.
Bareau is undoubtedly right in seeing the origin of their separation from
the Mahi.m-saasakas as lying in a dispute over the relative merits of the
Buddha and Sangha, but I am not sure if he realized that this could also be
the origin of the name.  Obviously, if your opponent is including the
Buddha under the heading of the Sangha, this easily leads to a view that
the Sangha is the highest of the three refuges. So the Dhammaguttas could
very well have been defending the primacy of the Dhamma.
