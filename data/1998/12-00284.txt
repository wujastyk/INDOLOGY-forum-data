All one has to do is pick up a book printed during the war -- 1944 is a
good year -- or right after. they are already almost dust (Lin Li-Kouang's
L'Aide-Memoire de La Vrai Loi from 1949 is an excellent example -- does one
even dare to try to open it?  Japanese books printed during the war are
wonderful in this respect -- I doubt many of them can even be microfilmed,
so brittle are they...)
Still, at least the *technology* for reading them exists and will continue
to exist into the future ( I *think*!)
