any interpretations.  How the literature has been compiled,
is another matter and we have to think as we proceed.
I might put together a course on Sankhya and astronomy.
I have been teaching in a local Indian cultural school for
the last fifteen years, and am trying to put together
a book.  More on this as I make more progress.
I can't agree more..
On a more personal note, St Paul's Cathedral in Boston does a
midnight interfaith service on the New Year's Eve and somehow,
I was recruited two years ago to recite sections of Hindu
scriptures.  I have to prepare a 5 minute recitation.
I will like people to recommend any favorites.  I had chosen
the last hymn of Rkveda in 1996 and the nasadiya sukta in 1997.
I wish to give another try on the vedas this year.  You may
post it here or send me private mail.
Thank you and all the best in 1999..
