many pancakes
I thank all those who give me so many pancakes.
        I was mainly interested by the making-off, hence the (a)pUpa of
Kalyanaraman, despite the ancientness quoted by Elliot Stern, is, alas,
useless.
        Similarly the roTI(kA) of Edeltraud Harzer Clear, analysed by
Elliot Stern. I resist to the temptation of latin rota 'wheel' which, in
fact, is linked to ratha ;-(    but portuguese? ;-)
        Mahendra Verma suggests Hindi cillaa but, being inexpert, I was
unable to find a Sanskrit root to this word. A loan-word?
        The ghAvana of Avinash Sathaye is puzzling, not found in
Monnier-Williams, where the nearest form seems to be a root ghuN- 'to go or
move about'. Mayrhofer (KEWA) precises ghuNati, ghoNati or ghUrNati 'moves
to and fro' (only ghUrN- 'waver' in Whitney). The 'n' seems to be in the
root but that's not sure, because MW and M give a link with ghola
'buttermilk', a product of churning. All this could suggest the ghAvana
pancake to be made with a movement (rotative? alternative?). Any precision
in the recipe? I think to the Greek kha(w)os 'original Chaos' (said in some
traditions = Tartaros, agitated by perpetual winds).
        Jonathan Silk suggests maNDaka and the (diminutive?) maNDIlaka.
This last word is given by MW: m. 'a kind of cake' (diyAv.) (hidden after
maNDa). Interesting. Made with cream (maNDa)? or shaped like the war-disk
(maNDala)? In both cases the idea of a rotation is possible (manth- for the
cream and for the poor head of Namuci).
        All this is very useful to me and I hope subsequent advices. Thanks
again,
