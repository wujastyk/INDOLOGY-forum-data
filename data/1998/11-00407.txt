OCR of (transcribed) indic texts
Dear J. Neuss and list-members,
Concerning the request for information about OCR I may mention that I used
an (expensive!!) programme called proLektor (by improx GmbH, Rennweg 83,
A-2345 Brunn am Gebirge) to skan the Sanskrit-Deutsches Woerterbuch by K.
Mylius (cf. my project report in "Langue, style et structure dans le monde
indien : Centenaire de Louis Renou", ed. N. Balbir et G.-J. Pinault, Paris
1996, p. 413-426). The programme has to be "taught" what to interpret (any
pattern surrounded by white space); the distinction of small i, capital I,
small l, numeral 1 in normal and bold fonts remained a problem. When used
in "interactive" mode I had to enter ca. 100 letters per page (out of ca.
4000). The result is far from error free. I tested the programme with
Gujarati text which works alright (but I did not skan enough text to be
able to say whether manual transliteration would be not MUCH slower but
less error prone).
Mr. Neuss, please keep me informed about your experiences and other
feed-back addressed to you directly. With thanks and best wishes,
