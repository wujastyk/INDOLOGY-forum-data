I should like to thank all the participants in this thread, and request
that the topic now be closed, or continued privately.  I'm afraid to say
that I have not been following this particular thread, but a glance at a
few recent messages suggests to me that the indological content of the
discussion has been exhausted.

All the best,
Dominik
