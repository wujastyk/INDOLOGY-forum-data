Interesting that the name, Muttusvami Diksitar
is used extensively in:
Emme te Nijenhuis, Sacred songs of India: Diksitar's
cycle of hymns to the Goddess Kamala.
1987, 2 v., Schweiz: Amadeus

I suspect strongly that muttusvAmi dIksitar has Tamil roots.
Unlike Tyagayya and other Telugu brahmins who settled in
Tamil country for a long time and who wrote in Telugu,
MuttusvAmi chose Sanskrit, even though the main courtly
patronage and elitist tastes were toward Telugu.
Is it a compromise that MuttusvAmi settled for?
