The historians, K. A. Nilakanta Sastri
and T. A. Gopinatha Rao say that
an avalokitesvara was discovered by
M. Foucher in Gandhara region.
It had an inscription, "dakSiNApatho
mUlavAsa lokanAtha".
Muulavaasam Buddhist monastery
was in today's Kerala, few miles
from Potiyil in the Malaya mountains.

Where this Lokanatha is published?
In one of Alfred Foucher's books??

Thanks for the help in advance.

Regards,
N. Ganesan
