Indology List
indology at Liverpool.ac.uk
Dear Members,
We have exchanged many thoughts about horses.
I wonder if the philologists on the list could speak to the words in the
relevant language families (I-E, Dravidian, etc.) pertaining to some of
the craft items found in the Indus Civilization Tradition: particularly
carnelian (beads), steatite (seals, beads, and other objects), agate
(beads), pearl and other marine shell objects.  The production sites,
trade paths and locations of use of these items are fairly well documented
in the archeology. It would seem to me words for them might be good
indicators of who was in contact with whom, when and where.
