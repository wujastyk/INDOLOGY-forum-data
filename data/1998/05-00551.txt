Spelling of S. Radhakrishnan's name sought
S.Radhakrishnan's birth place was tiruttaNi in Tamil NaDu. His surname is
sarve:palli. I have to investigate where it is located. His surname and
birth place are two different things. Anyway please check his biography by
his son Dr. S. Gopal; the title Dr. S. Radhakrishnan, New Delhi : Oxford
(may be 1990 or 1989). Bh.K.
