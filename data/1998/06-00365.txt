 In any case, the Rgvedic poets did - apparently - not refer to a brick,
neither
 one for daily use, nor one for ritual purposes. Only the latter 'omission'
 could perhaps be explained with reference to their association with the Hotr-
 function.
 As for word-history and etymology, is'tiia occurs only in young Avestan
 (according to both Bartholomae and Mayrhofer) and in "altpersisch" (according
 to Mayrhofer), i.e. in the cuneiform inscriptions from ca. 520 B.C. onwards.
 Ritualistic, intra-vedic etymology of the Yajurvedic iSTikA/iSTakA seems
 perspicuous, but Iranian terms are difficult to fit in, point to an older
form
 with a different but problematic etymology. Primacy of ritualistic term of
the
 Yajurveda is of course also problematic: why would the Iranians borrow it in
a
 time when they must already have been acquainted with the object?

 Interesting. But, whatever the Iranian connections, the Harappan ruins were
 still around (perhaps directly referred to by the RV poets), and presumably
 also some local people who had not yet forgotten the technique of burning
 bricks (cf. the acculturation), though they apparently could not get
organized
 any more to build monumental constructions like in the Sarasvati-Indus civ.

If my understanding of Jan Houben's position is correct, there does not seem
to be a consenus on the etymology of iSTaka. I would appreciate if the experts
discuss what relationship, if any, the word for brick has to do with the word
iSTi and its etymology.
