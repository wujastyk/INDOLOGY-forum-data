Dear Dr. Ganesan,

I wish I could write at length.

I feel that the assumptions made in the following lines are too simplistic.
Prof. VNR has written on the role (and importance) of Sanskrit in mediaeval
Andhra. As beginning I would first read his recent essay:

Coconut and Honey: Sanskrit and Telugu in medieval Andhra
Social Scientist, Vol 23 Nos 10-12, Oct-Dec 1995, pp 24-40

More later,

Regards,
Sreenivas

P.S Thanks once again for Shulman's biblio.!
