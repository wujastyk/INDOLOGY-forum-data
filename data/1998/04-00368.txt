Telugu history
Dear Dr. Ganesan,
I wish I could write at length.
I feel that the assumptions made in the following lines are too simplistic.
Prof. VNR has written on the role (and importance) of Sanskrit in mediaeval
Andhra. As beginning I would first read his recent essay:
Coconut and Honey: Sanskrit and Telugu in medieval Andhra
Social Scientist, Vol 23 Nos 10-12, Oct-Dec 1995, pp 24-40
More later,
Regards,
Sreenivas
P.S Thanks once again for Shulman's biblio.!
