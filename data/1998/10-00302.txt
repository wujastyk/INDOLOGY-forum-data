The Conference offers a privilege of meeting the new leadership of the
Government of India. With the full support of the Cabinet of Prime
Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, Mrs. Maneka Gandhi has created history in
her Ministry of Social Welfare and Empowerment. Just in six months since
assuming office in March 1998, she has implemented 37 centrally
sponsored schemes, upgraded the Rehabilitation Council of India Act, and
successfully launched World's largest program for rehabilitation of the
disabled with a Rupees 440 million national project called the "Bridge
Course". We are very sincerely hoping that with her golden touch, we
will be able to implement the plans and programs to save the lives of
the dowry victims in India.

The tragedy of dowry and bride-burning in India is as enormous as that
of the land-mines which has horrified the world. It is now estimated
that about 25,000 brides are killed or disabled every year in India over
dowry disputes, which exceed the estimated 21,000 civilians killed or
disabled in land-mine accidents every year all over the world. Moreover,
land-mine accidents are NOT culpable homicides. Bride-burning is a
culpable homicide, perpetrated by intimate members of the victims
marital family, who do not display any sense of guilt.

To understand, and to draw world attention to the problem, the "First
International Conference on Dowry and Bride-Burning" was held at Harvard
Law School in 1995. In this Conference, a "Six Point Program to
Eradicate Dowry and Bride-Burning in India" was adopted, which was
further revised at the "Second" and the "Third International Conference"
held at Harvard and London University in 1996 and 1997, respectively.

One of the major goals of the forthcoming "Fourth International
Conference" will be to discuss and finalize the "Six Point Program" and
make plans to lauch the "Program" in India next year.

PRE-CONFERENCE PANEL DISCUSSIONS:

A series of "Pre-Conference Panel Discussions" are planned to be held on
November 8, November 22 and November 29, 1998, at 12:30 PM each day, at
