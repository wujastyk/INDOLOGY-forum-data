In the semiticization of Hinduism (missions got started
from Vivekananda's sishyas. In the desperate
search for an equivalent to Bible and Quran,
Hindus found their answer in Gita. In the constructs of
Indian nationalism, Gita plays a larger role
in the last century or so. But TirukkuRaL of Tiruvalluvar
is much more egalitarian and secular compared to
Bhagavad Gita)
In Adi Sankaracharya's Bhaja Govindam, there is a verse that says the
following :
        For him, who has studied the Bhagavadgita even a little, who has drunk a
drop of the Ganga water, and who has performed the worship of the Destroyer
of the demon Mura (viz. Shri Krishna) at least once, there is no tiff with
Yama (the Lord of Death).
The primacy to Bhagvadgita is old, probably predating Sankaracharya
himself. Similarly we know the popularity of Sri Krishna and the Ganga
river. Not to say that the primacy was accorded to these after Sri Sankara
wrote the Bhaja Govindam. He was merely expounding the known facts about
society .
