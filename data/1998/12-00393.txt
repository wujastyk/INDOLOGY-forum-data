Indian children born abroad -- some (more) clarifications
Ahimsa sakalo dharma.
Ahimsa is not only the absence of himsa but the active opposition of it
(himsa). - Paramhamsa Yogananda (Autobiography of a Yogi)
Shri Banerjee, it is not in the saying but in the doing. Our forefathers
realized this a long time ago and have preached it through their works and
words.
No more comments on this please. Please visit http://www.idrf.org for some
of the work "hate-mongers" have done and are doing.
Thanks
Ashish
