Question: Matrimonials in Indian newspapers?
Dear members of Indology:
I hope a member of this group can help with this question for a novel
currently in editing "What the Body Remembers" (Doubleday USA/Knopf
Canada, 1999). I need to know if matrimonial advertisements were used in
Punjab - in Punjabi or Urdu papers as early as 1930? I did find
reference to the practise in a memoir published in 1946, but I really
need to know about 1930. Many thanks in advance for your assistance. If
you would like to respond off-list, my email is sbaldwin at execpc.com
