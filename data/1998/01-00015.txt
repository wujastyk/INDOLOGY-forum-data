kuyava in RV
I am inrigued by the following RV lines (Source: the Vedavid Web site), in
which an enemy of Vedic Aryans is called "kuyava".

With respect to RV 1.103.8 Griffith says that kuyava "probably, "causing bad
harvests," is the name of another of the demons of drought." In connection
with RV 1.104.3, Griffith says that kuyava is "perhaps a name given by the
Aryans to one of the non-Aryan chieftains". Does anybody know of any
discussions related to "kuyava" in RV?
This is interesting because "kuyavan" in Tamil means "potter". Also another
Tamil word "iruGkOvEL" has been used to refer to potter as well as chieftain
in Tamil texts.
