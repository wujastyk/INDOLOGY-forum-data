The aim is NOT to prove that the first center of horse domestication was
in India, but it does show that the Harappans could not have been ignorant
about horses. The Akhal Teke has been present in Turkmenistan atleast from
Harappan times. So it is untenable to suggest that the Harappans did not
know horses or did not use them (albeit in smaller numbers -
when compared to cattle - and hence their high value!).
Exactly - if there was a migration into India then the influence
must appear later on in India as well, which doesnt seem to be !
If you notice, the BMAC also did not seem to need any "migrating Aryans" for
its development. On the other hand, the BMAC influence
seems to have spread into Iran (refer to Hiebert,Erdosy Vol).
Also,the BMAC is exactly where the Dasas,Dahyu and the Panis are placed
(Parpola in same vol).
Archeologists see no evidence of Indra Rommels with their chariot panzers
rumbling into India thru mountain passes - despite the vivid imaginations of
a few.
