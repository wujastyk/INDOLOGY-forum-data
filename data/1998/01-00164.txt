How much affected and violent in language certain people get when not
everyone accept fully what they believe to be truth. For me a translation in
Hebrew would have quite sense, but  not  much in Yidish, a disapearing,
second language , no doubt a patois and a german dialect, an exclusive
vehicle for communication only between members of a certain community
without any universal aim. That's why it sounds strange to me and don't come
with that old paranoid talk of anti-semitism.
