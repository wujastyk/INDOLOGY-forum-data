Hindu traditional view
I am finding that while it is fair game to discuss Indian bias, it is
not always the same concerning Eurocentrism. During the last heated
discussion on this issue, I found that I suddenly was unable to post
back responses after bringing up Euro bias.  I had to wait for awhile
and re-subscribe using a different version of my address.
Remember that the whole AIT theory is based on very liberal
interpretation of a group of religious hymns whose date of origin is
highly speculative.
