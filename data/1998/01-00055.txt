Dear Prof. Simson
I read your message only today after Christmass vacations.
I am quoting the gita Press edition of BhAgavata IX.14.7 
"samarastArakAmayah" translated as "There raged a battle for 
the sake of Tara which caused the annihilation of gods an 
asuras." This interpretation is attested by VaMZIdhara in
his commentary as "tAraiva tArakA tasyA hetorAgataH 
PrAptastArakAmayaH "mayaT ca" iti hetuvAcakAdAgata ityarthe mayaT.
The suffix mayaT is added in three senses: 1.vikAra, meaning 
made of, or transformation of. ex. mRnmayo ghataH; kASThamayam 
gRham, a jar made of earth, a house made of wood or jar is the 
transformation of earth; a house is the transformation of wood.
The analysyss of the example mRnmayo gataH is mRdo vikAraH. 
The question arises how there is SaSthi vibhakti i mRdah 
because SaSthi is always in vaiyadhikaranya and prathamA is in 
sAmAnAdhikaranya. Thus SaSthi in bheda or difference and 
prathamA is in abheda or non difference. 
In the example devadattaH brAhmaNaH, devadatta is not 
different from brAhmaNaH, therefore prathamA. But in the 
examples mRdo ghatah, pASANasya pratimA or mama gRham, there 
is difference. Why there is SaSthi vibhakti in mRdo ghataH in 
the absence of identity?
2. prAchurya, meaning profusion or excess or abundance. ex. 
ghRtamayo yaj?aH. The sacrifice having abundant clarified butter.
3. hetuvacakAdAgata. ex. a) viSamamayah and samamayah "kAZikA"
b) anyA jagad-dhitamayI manasaH pravRttiH (paNDitarAja 
jagannAtha bhAminIvilAsa 1.68)
c) tathAtma paramAtmanorupaniSanmayI saNgame
   vilAsa muralI bhavA virutiradya vairAyate.(rUpagoswami, 
vidagdhamAdhava 6.11)
I hope that this will answer your query.
Sincerely
R.V. Joshi
