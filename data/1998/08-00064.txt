  In the story of Ziva, dakSa and satI, vIrabhadra and mahaGkAlI are
created by Ziva from his hair.

 In addition, in the hitOpadEza tales, we have the story of 3
knowledgable Brahmins naieve to the ways of the world and 1 Brahmin
who is unknowledgable but wise to the ways of the world. The 4 Brahmins
come accross a skeleton of a tiger. The first 3 reconstruct
the skeleton of the tiger, give it flesh and blood and then life and
get killed. The fourth , who warns the others against giving the
skeleton life climbs up a tree and saves his life. Would this qualify as
cloning?

Regards,
Krishna
