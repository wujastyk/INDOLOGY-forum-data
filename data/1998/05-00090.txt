Zraadha in Nepal
I require some information about the practices and beliefs of the Kathmandhu
valley's Sakyas. Either direct answers or references for further research
would be most appreciated.
1) Though Buddhist, do the Sakyas perform zraadha ceremonies in honor of the
dead akin to those performed by the valley's Hindu population?
2) Does Sakyamuni receive mention in the course of the Sakyas' funerary
rites, in his capacity as a member of the clan rather than as a buddha? In
other words, is he treated as an ancestor, or even clan-deity?
3) Does Dipankara have any place in the Sakyas' funerary rites? In other
words, is he treated as an ancestor, or even clan-deity?
4) How is inhertance distributed upon the death of a father? How do the
Sakyas' inheritance practices compare with those of other groups in the valley?
Thanks in advance,
