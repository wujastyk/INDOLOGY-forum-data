I have written on this in my _The Concept of Divinity in Jainism_
(Toronto: Univ. of Toronto, 1993), in connection with Jaina yak.sa
worship, which is quite ancient (see particularly pp. 19-27).

I doubt whether it is simply a cynical matter of priests wanting to
consolidate their grip on the lay populace. If bhakti in essence was
already so old, there would no question of 'losing' a following, since
any adherence to brahminical Hinduism would have to be seen as a
relatively later development and a gain. It looks much more like a slow,
gradual process of cultural interpenetration, a kind of osmosis. And if
bhakti could be traced to the practices which are described in ancient
Jaina and Buddhist sources, then it would also be wrong to think of
bhakti as a specifically Tamil phenomenon, even if Tamil authors gave
the bhakti movement an impetus. After all, the kind of phenomena which
Embree mentions are also found in Prakrit, Sanskrit and Kannada Jaina
texts from Karnataka. (And of course definitions of 'bhakti' differ from
one religious tradition to another.)
