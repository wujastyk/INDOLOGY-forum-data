REference
Members of the list:
On p. 25 of his book "Vedic Aryans and the Origin of Civilization" Navratna
Rajaram says: "Assuming the date 4004 BCE for the creation of the world (as
Max Mueller did), leads to 2448 BCE as the date for the Biblical flood."
As is often the case, Rajaram does not give a reference. Does anybody know
exactly where Max Mueller supports the Biblical chronology?
