Try:

<http://www.indigo.ie/egt/standards/bod/ranjanaa-lipi-varnamaalaa.pdf>

<http://www.indigo.ie/egt/standards/bod/pracalita-nepaal-lipi.pdf>

for transcription,

and

<http://www.indigo.ie/egt/standards/iso10646/pdf/newari.pdf>

<http://www.indigo.ie/egt/standards/iso10646/pdf/nepali.pdf>

for the proposed ISO 10646 encoding standards for the Nepali and Rajana
scripts.

The first two are large files. You you will need Adobe's Acrobat Reader
plug-in installed in your browser to view any of them as they are PDF files.
