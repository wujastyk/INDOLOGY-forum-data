*Sal- is also one of Krahe's "Alteuropaeische" hydronyms, giving
river names from Scandinavia (Sala) to Spain (Jal?n) and from Wales
(Hail) to the Ukraine (Solja), passing through the Saumur, the Saale
and the Szala.

Are you suggesting that the original sense of the IE root was "water,
bathing place" rather than "salt"?   Or were you referring only to
Pre-Greek?
