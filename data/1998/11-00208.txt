>?From a serious standpoint, there is no reason to surmise that Indian
peoples are any less violent than those of the steppe. Just look at the
abhorrent violence in Sri Lanka or in Northeast India today. And I don't
think anyone can deny that there is a great deal of caste violence that
still goes on today, although I haven't heard of anyone getting the
molten lead treatment.
