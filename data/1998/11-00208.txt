peoples are any less violent than those of the steppe. Just look at the
abhorrent violence in Sri Lanka or in Northeast India today. And I don't
think anyone can deny that there is a great deal of caste violence that
still goes on today, although I haven't heard of anyone getting the
molten lead treatment.
