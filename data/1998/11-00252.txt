Your apologies have been accepted. And as to the nouns, indeed, the gender is not obvious; it's invisible. The only way to see it is in combination with pronouns, which clearly have gender (hij 'he', zij 'she', het 'it' and so on). By the way, next time you read Dutch, try NRC Handelsblad instead of De Telegraaf; much more educated.
