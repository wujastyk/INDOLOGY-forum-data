Dear friends,

Does anybody have any knowledge of the tApanIyopaniSads (also tApanI upaniSads)? I have a number of commentaries to the GopAlatApanI, but other than the statement found therein that it was well known in Gujarat, I can find no information about this or the other works coming (apparently) from the same school  (rAmatApanI, nRsiMghatApanI). They are obviously very late VaiSNava UpaniSads. Can anybody add to this meagre store of knowledge?

Thanking you all in advance for your help,

Jan Brzezinski
