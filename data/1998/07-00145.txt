Brahma-Vidya (Adyar Library Bulletin) found
For Indology and SACAP:
I managed to delete a query from someone requesting a photocopy from
Brahmavidya (Adyar Library Bulletin), v. 8 (1944), probably from one of
these lists.  I have the volume by me.  Would the person making the request
please contact me?
