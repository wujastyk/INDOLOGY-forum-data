This is a very interesting question. This seems to be a case of early entrants
to brahminhood discriminating against later entrants/aspirants. Consider the
following.

<< I am afraid there is no "traditional explanation" of the name

 discusses the Chinese  versions of the name (my translations of Bareau's
 French: "Lineage of the Perfumes" referring possibly to a Sanskrit name
 dhUpagotra, and "Lineage of Smoke") and is of the opinion that these names
 are invented to connect this brahmin in one way or the other with the smoke
 of the funeral pile or with the incense offered to the relics. They are
 certainly not "common names for brahmins", but ad hoc inventions (dhUmra
 meaning "smoky", from dhUma, "smoke"). >>
In a posting entitled "Smoking, seasoning, and cooking in Dravidian" on May
31, 1998, I discussed the meaning of Dravidian word "kuy". I am showing a
portion of that below.
"?..One set of  meanings given for "kuy" by Tamil Lexicon is "burnt
odors, incense, odorous smoke". In fact, the original meaning of  "kuy" is
embedded in the word "kuyin" (DEDR 1765) meaning "cloud". A comparison of the
word "kuyin" meaning "cloud" and the lines "kurUuk kuyppukai mazai magkulin2
parantu?" indicates that the original meaning of the root "kuy" is also "to
smoke" same as "pukai".
That the basic meaning of "kuy" is smoking is also indicated by related words
in other Dravidian languages. The recent finding that the alternation of
radical u>o is possible even without the presence of any derivative vowel "a"
(See DEDR 4281   Ta. puy, poy - to be pulled out), allows us to link Tamil
"kuy" with central and north Dravidian words such as the following.
DEDR 2226 KonDa gOyi smoke (of kitchen). Pe. koy smoke; kOd- (kOtt-) to smoke
(intr.); kOt- (kOtt-) id. (trans.), burn incense. ?Pa. gUJ- to smoke; gUJi,
gUJjkud smoke. ? Go. (W. Ph.) kusso smoke; (SR. Ch. Mu.) kosso, (Mu. Ma.)
kosoy, (G.) kosoyi soot; (Tr.) kossO soot on bottom of cooking-pot (Voc. 954).
?Kui kuhula smoke. Although DEDR does not show them, Kurukh kuhkuhrnA meaning
"to rise up in clouds (said only of smoke and dust)", kuhRa'Ana "to apply
smoke to, to fumigate", kuilA "charcoal" (Source: An Oraon-English
Dictionary); and Malto kuhe "mist fog" (Source: Malto-Hindi-English
Dictionary) also seem to be related "to kuy".
Based on the above analysis, I have come to believe that the word meaning
smoke seems to form the basis for deriving one of the Dravidian words meaning
potter, "kuyavan2" as one who makes/is associated with smoke. (DEDR 1762 lists
Ta. kuyam, kuyavan2, and kO as cognates meaning potter.) Consider the
following Classical Tamil poem.

iru nilam tikiri A peru malai
maN A van2aital ollum O nin2akku E  (puRanAn2Uru 228.1-15)
Here, the poet asks a potter who is making the burial urn to inter the Chola
king, "O potter (kO)! who makes the pot  in the old town's tall kiln which
raises darkness-concentrated  smoke which spreads in the sky. You are to be
pitied?Since neTumAvaLavan2 reached the world of the devas, if you desire to
throw a wide urn to inter him, can you somehow do it with the wide world as
the wheel and the big mountain as the lump of clay?" Another CT poem
(akanAn2Uru 308.5) describes a country as one where the clouds covering the
hills are like the smoke from the potter's kiln (kalam cuTu pukai). Certainly,
the smoke from the potter's kiln was significant enough that the poets linked
it with the clouds so readily.
I was struck by the name dhUmrasagotra  in the text Dr. Simson mentioned. It
would almost seem to be a Sanskrit translation of the Dravidian word for
potter and offer another clue to the transformation of potters into brahmins.
In explaining the term kulAlikAmnAya for one of the Tantric traditions, J. A.
Schoterman  (The SaTsAhasra saMhitA, 1982, p.8)  says, "In a rural community
the presence of a potter is almost indispensable because of the product he
manufactures, namely a pot. Besides as the producer of this important daily
utensil the potter appears to have carried out "certain ritual tasks which may
date from prehistoric urn burial and have augmented to make him virtually the
priest to certain lower classes" (Kosambi 1977:21). Next to this the potter is
credited with the invention of the clay-plaster in bone-setting (Kosambi
1977:22). All this makes it clear that the potter played a significant role in
the socio-religious life of an Indian village community from very early times
onwards. The pot manufactured by the potter is an important daily utensil, but
next to this the pot is often regarded as DevI Herself or Her local
manifestation?.During Tantric rituals and ceremonies DevI is born again in the
