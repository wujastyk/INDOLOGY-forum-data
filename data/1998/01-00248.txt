What impresses me the patience with which some people take even patently un
called for remarks such as about Why have Gita in Yiddish so seriously and
explain teh whole issue. I  salute you Mr lars
keep it up and those who asked this rather silly question, shoudl be more
considerate of traffic on inetrnet and avoid crowding it by posting such
remarks

thanks
