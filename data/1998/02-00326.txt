The Lost Years of Jesus
This is just too wierd and wonderful to pass up.
I understand that there is apparently a cult in Kashmir dedicated to the
propagation of this belief. It's sort of like the Mormon idea that Jesus
spent time in South America after the Resurrection.
I think Moses was also supposed to have spent some time in Kashmir as
well? Anybody know anything about that? There is even a tomb of Moses'
somewhere ?
