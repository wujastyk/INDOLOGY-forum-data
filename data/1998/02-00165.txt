Some small interest there is (or was quite recently). In 1980 I
visited a bookstore in Bombay and find a very good selection of Greek
and Latin texts, mainly in bilingual Loeb editions. I bought myself
the three volume edition of De natura animalium by Aelian.

This is really interesting question and I hope somebody is able to
give some light on this. In Sri Lanka the University of Peradeniya
still has a Department of Classics teaching Greek and Latin, but how
is the situation in India.
