In many years of using Velthuis's font, I have not observed this problem.
Can you post the minimum file which demonstrates the problem clearly?
This sort of thing can arise if you use TFM files which don't match the MF
files; Velthuis's font did undergo an upgrade some years ago when the
hyphenation feature was added.  At that time it became necessary to delete
the old fonts altogether, and the TFMs, and reinstall the new fonts.  If
you have a hybrid old/new system, you might get unpredictable results.
All the best,
