One case in which I remember that scholars have presumed hypercorrection is the word "draavi.da" <- "drami.la" <- "dami.la" <- "tami_l", where an 'r' was inserted to account for the last consonant being retroflex. This is the only one I can think of right now, but surely somebody will have given the topic more serious attention and written about it.
