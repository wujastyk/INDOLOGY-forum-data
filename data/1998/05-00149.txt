        I would like to know. I remember the droNa's son azvatthAman
"having the strength of a horse" who share his name with an elephant...
        I'd like to take advantage of this return of the elephant to ask
again if the elephant is renowned in Indian tradition for a specially high
sexual power. I'm particularly interested by the ability to have many
intercourses. Not only reality but also litterary, or even popular,
metaphors would be useful to me.
