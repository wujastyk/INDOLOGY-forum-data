... Sanskrit for MS Word Utility
No. My apologies. Most of my effort has been going into the Word 97
version. The Sanskrit 1.2 is an upgrade of the Sanskrit New font, and
I was switching over, but forgot to amend part of the coding. You
should find the version there now OK. Sorry to have put you to
inconvenience.
Best wishes
John
