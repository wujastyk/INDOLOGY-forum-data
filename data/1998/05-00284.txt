That will happen when the Indians start writing them! :-)
On a more serious note, I have seen that expatriate Indians
are more keen in cultural matters than desi people. Of course,
the expatriates form a very non representative group, castewise. Also,
who will get the various paNDitas from Varanasi, Chennai, Pune etc
to write something in common.
No doubt someone will blame the British for this situation... :-)
