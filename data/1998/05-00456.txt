Hi,

I started penning a mail to the indology mailing list on the subject
of 'dating' Sarasvati River. It has become rather long, about 15
pages. I will be happy to
email it directly to you. Please send me an email. I can respond
attaching a html or word draft document in three parts of evidence
from: (1) earth sciences; (2) archaeology; (3) linguistics.

These drafts will constitute the preface to the forthcoming website on
the corpus of inscriptions and clusters of Indian lexemes.

Regards,
