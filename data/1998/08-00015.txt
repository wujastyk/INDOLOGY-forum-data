Frog Hymn Article
I thought that Gautama V. Vajracharya's 1997 (?) Frog Hymn (RV 7.103)
article "The Adaptation of Monsoonal Culture by Rgvedic Aryans: A Further
Study of The Frog Hymn" was part of Elect. Jnl. of Vd. St. but when I go
to this site, only 1995 seems to be there, and the searcher claims to have
heard of neither him, nor frogs, nor Monsoons, --
Does soemone know where this article exists online?
