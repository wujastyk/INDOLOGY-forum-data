        I want to thank George Thompson for bringing up the discussion of
the genesis of RV retroflexion.  He has already referred to my
publications and Hans Hock's publications on this subject.  As I see it,
old hands like Hans and myself get entrenched in our own positions.  I
would like to see someone else take up this question and re-evaluate the
debate from some new angle, perhaps George Thompson could do it.
        All the best,
                                Madhav Deshpande
