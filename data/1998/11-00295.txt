An anthropological reaction is further found in Michael Houseman and Carlo
Severi's Back to Naven: a relational approach to ritual action (reworked
English version of Naven ou le donner a voir: essai d'interpretation de
l'action rituelle, to appear with Brill, Leiden). Part III contains elaborate
theoretical considerations which take Staal's theory (among others) into
account.
