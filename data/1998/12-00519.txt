creation of human kind
Bijoy Misra (BM) writes in response to Erik Hoogcarspel:
It's a spiritual concept, not scientific and objective.
Emotion-laced subjective argument. Objectivity is, rapes, murders, wars,
slavery, and poverty cannot be divine (if there is any supernatural
divinity in the first place). They are all man-made.
And a realistic perception indeed.
Another argument is that most sufferings are deliberately caused and
sustained by the socially, economically, and religiously privileged.
Mathematical reasoning can't "prove" the existence of God. Only
spirituality and beliefs can. So, it's ironic that someone avidly using
subjectivity is now trying to bring up objective reasoning such as
mathematics.
