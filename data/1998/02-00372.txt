The Lost Years of Jesus

Mr Nevo,
Many thanks for such interesting info.
There are an awful lot of people in the world claiming descent from the
lost tribe! This theory is in conflict with the Mormon mythology which
also claims a lost tribe descent, as well as a belief that Jesus was
teaching in South America after the Resurrection. But maybe Jesus spent
the post-Resurrection years in a kind of bi-continental commute.
"The Kaka Stone" sounds like some kind of relic? This is sort of
reminiscent of medieval  saints who had bits and pieces of themselves
all over the Christian world. There were probably enough pieces of the
"True Cross" to build a museum to house all the shrouds, swaddling
clothes and bits of  Jesus' Crown of Thorns which pinpointed the
pilgrimage routes.
Scientific proof is irrelevant and unnecessary, and even threatening,
when one is operating on faith.
Best Regards,
Mary
