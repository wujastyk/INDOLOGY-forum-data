[q] transl. of Biardeau's essay
I am wondering if a translation (or atleast a 1-2 page long summary)
of Madeleine Biardeau's paper: "Nala et Damayanti, heros epiques,"
Indo-Iranian Journal (1984) is available.
Thanks in advance!

P.S.  Not related to above query ....
There are a couple of essays by Ch. Vaudeville, on govardhana myth,
published in Indo-Iranian journal between years 1976 and 1980
