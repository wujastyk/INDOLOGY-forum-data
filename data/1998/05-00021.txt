Dear Indologists,

Only recently we found that the e-test of the Baudhaayana-Dharmasuutra
(baudha.dhs) at my ftp server was incomplete.
I am sorry for giving you inconvenience.

Today I put the whole text in my ftp server:
ccftp.kyoto-su.ac.jp
/pub/doc/sanskrit/dharmas

You can also get access to the server through my homepage:
http://www.kyoto-su.ac.jp/~yanom/

I am planning to update the subdirectory jyotisa.
