There are probably *hundreds* of theories. But on this thread there has
been a tendency [shared by all of us, I think] to group theories together
according to the sorts of evidence they deal with and the sorts of
interpretations that they use. Linguists have their methods and biases.
Archaeologists have theirs. I merely wanted to distinguish philology from
linguistics, in this sense: if you are working directly with texts, you are
not being 'theoretical' [as a linguist is who reconstructs a
proto-language, for example]. That's all.
