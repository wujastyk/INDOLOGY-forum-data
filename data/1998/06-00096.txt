Many answers:


* (McAlpin wanted to connect Dravidian with Elamite (in, Mesopotamia, now
SW Iran).


        McAlpin,D., Towards Proto-Elamo-Dravidian, Language 50, 1974, 89-101

        implication.

        1981

Dravidologists have not agreed with his recostructions. See
B.K.Krishnamurti, recently in this list. F.B.J. Kuiper always told me the
same.

* F. Southworth wants to see an old IA-Dravidian meetings, still in Iran.
Term such as tanuu, discussed here last year. Both stress a
pre-agricultural Proto-Dravidian society, mainly cattle-herders (with
horse? Brahui hulli, Tamil ivuLi?)

* Some linguists have seen a connection with Uralic (Finno-Ugrian) for
decades.

        Uralic and Dravidian etymological vocabularies  [PhD diss. ] Austin 1974

* Finally, there are, of course, the Nostratic linguists who have,
beginning with the Russian scholars, the late V.M. Illich-Svitych, and his
colleagues Dolgopolski, and Shevoroshkin, reconstructed a super-family
that includes Dravidian, Indo-European, Afro-Asiatic (Hamito-Semitic),
Uralic,  Altaic and some of the Caucasus (Kartvelian) languages.

        comparison of  Proto-Indo-European and Proto-Afroasiatic. Amsterdam ;
        Philadelphia : J. Benjamins, 1984.


That would solve all "Aryan problems" in India, isn't it: aarya and
Dravidans had been brothers all along, way back in Central Asia...

Many traditional IE scholars combat the Nostratic theory, a concept that
is not difficult to understand but hard to follow since you have to know
and handle everything from Old Irish to Finnish, Berber, Old Egyptian,
Akkadian, Georgian, Old Tamil, Vedic, Old Turkish and Old Japanese. Few
people that  I know can do that...

Of course, no need to mentional the crackpot comparisons which link
Dravidian directly to anything from W. African to  Japanese, or make Tulu
"the mother of English"....

Just one case:

        Lahovary, N. Dravidian origins and the West; newly discovered
        ties with the ancient culture and languages, including Basque, of the
        pre-Indo-European Mediterranean world.  Bombay: Orient Longmans 1963

* Some archaeologists, probably starting with S. P Tolstov, have connected
Central Asian cultural assemblages with the Dravidians.

        Tolstov, S.P. in: 13th annual report of the Institut eof Archaeology of
        the London University, London 1959, 8-26   (= Kelteminar culture of
        N.Uzbekistan) (or his book on Ancient Khorezm, 1948++)

        cf. now F. T. Hiebert,  South Asia from a Central Asian
        perspective,  In:
        The Indo-Aryans of Ancient South Asia, ed. G. Erdosy (ed.).  Berlin/New
        York  1995, 192-212


Hope this makes for a beginning....
