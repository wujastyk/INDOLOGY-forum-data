I'm familiar with this author from his very carefully researched biography
of Max Mueller (1974), which is in my research area (history of
language-study). But as a non-Indologist, I am not sure how prominent a
figure Chaudhuri is. I notice his name was brought up (see above) in JK's
short list of Indian scholars who might have studied or known Greek and/or
Latin. Is that because Chaudhuri is unusual among Indian scholars in knowing
Greek and Latin, or because he is a particularly prominent Indologist, and
thus a good example of a well-known Indologist who perhaps knew Latin? When
did he die, by the way (as the above para. seems to imply)?
