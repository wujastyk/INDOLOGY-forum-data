Indo-Aryan invasion
In response to the post of Erik Seldeslachts:

 <The Indo-Aryans
Interesting. But I see things quite differently. I interpret the Mitanni
texts as evidence rather that the Aryans *hadn't reached* the Indian
sub-continent yet. Or otherwise that these people, whose language is Indic
rather than Indo-Iranian, turned west instead of east [a lost tribe?], and
*never made it* to the sub-continent.
I agree that one might not be looking at the right period. If we are going
to revise the dates, say, of the RV, I would recommend revising upward: in
my view the RV may well be contemporary with Avestan and as late or even
later than 1000 BCE. In my view, Renfrew is uttterly wrong [very ignorant
about things Vedic]. And I cannot see how any possible 'intrusion' in the
4th millennium BCE can have anything at all to do with Vedic Aryans. I see
the RV as best understood as an Indo-Iranian text, and the culture area out
of which it came as an Indo-Iranian culture area.
This researcher, a Vedicist not a historian, calls this model the "Aryan
migration thesis", and I do not see it as a straitjacket at all. The only
revision that I would recommend, besides the later dating, would be to
abandon the images of war-like Aryans on horses and war-chariots, which I
agree were conjured up by the lurid imagination of a previous generation of
scholars. In my view, which comes from studying the RV, these Aryans did
not march into the sub-continent. They drifted in, in small waves. And the
vehicle that they rode in on was not so much the chariot as the mantra.
But who know? Perhaps my imagination is rather lurid too.
Best wishes,
