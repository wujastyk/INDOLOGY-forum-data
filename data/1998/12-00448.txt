SV: creation of human kind

We believe (and according to our scriptures too), GOD created

evolution of mankind? Does any of our scriptures suggest
similar to the theory of Darwin?
[Lars Martin Fosse]
No early religion or scripture suggest a theory of evolution similar to
Darwin. As for God's actions, scripture does not contradict Darwin as long
as it does not suggest a creative method or procedure that is different
from the one suggested by Darwin. In principle, God may be behind
evolution. But strictly speaking, scientific models do not include God.
They only deal with what can be studied systematically and explained in
natural terms. God is beyond the reach of science, which can neither prove
nor disprove his existence.
