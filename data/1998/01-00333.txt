Gopal,
There is also the story of Bhagadatta, ally of Dhuryodhana, who mourned
the death of his gallant war elephant, Supratiika, when it was killed by
Arjuna. Alexander the Great went into mourning upon the death of his
horse, Bucephalus.
I've actually run across some hero stones dedicated to pets, one to a
dog named Loka who killed 75 wild boar.
There is also the story of a king of the Goa Kadamba dynasty who
immolated himself for the sake of his pet parrot killed by a cat. The
king had lured the parrot out of its cage and when it was killed by the
cat the king in remorse sacrificed himself.

Woof,
Mary
