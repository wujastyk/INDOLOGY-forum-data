Buddha in Chinese script
  Would Xuan Zang (Hsuan Tsang) around 640 A.D.write Buddha as
  Pu-ta or Po-ta?? It does not appear that he travelled south
  of Kanchi where he stayed. He must have heard about Potiyil/Potikai from
  Kanchi or north of Kanchi.

  I remember Dr. Jayabarathi's mentioning of Malaya, Lankasuka, ...
  Indians named many places in South East Asia after Indian placenames.
  eg., Vietnam as Amaravati, etc., This Malaya in SE Asia must be one such
  naming.
  However, Potalaka in Hsuan Tsang's narrative is said to be near the
  Malaya mountain range in the extreme South of India.
  The Malaya mountains in South India are mentioned from Ramayana
  onwards.
Dr. Anne Monius informed me:
*a variety of Chinese folktales speak of Hsuan Tsang bringing
*Potalaka mountain with him from South India and depositing it in Western
*China.
   Note that these tales also place Potalaks in the South India.
   Does the Journey to the West novel speak of Potalaka?
