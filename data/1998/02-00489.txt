Caldwell, Dravidian Linguistics (Was: Tamil words in English)
Want to know where in the USA, I can find the PhD thesis of
U. Dharmarajan on the College of Fort St. George, Madras.
In 1980s from univ. of Madras.
F. W. Ellis was associated with it, may be more on his
Indian mss. collection, its fate, the vaccination papers
from this dissertation?!
