An interesting thing to look into regarding the attitude about women's
intelligence may be the gender classification in Central Dravidian vs. South
Dravidian. Telugu apparently has male and non-male (which includes femininine
as well as neuter) classification for singular while Tamil has persons (where
males, and females are included) and non-persons classification.
