A ninth century prose (Have to see what date Zvelebil gives),
first available prose commentary in tamil, is described in:

David C. Buck, K. Paramasivam (Translators)
Nakkiiran2aar,
The story of stolen love: a translation of kaLaviyal en2Ra
iRaiyan2aar akapporuL with commentary.
Scholar's press, 1997, 323 p.

This treats PaaNDik kOvai and its commentary which predates
TirukkOvaiyaar of Saint Maa.nikkavaacakar.
