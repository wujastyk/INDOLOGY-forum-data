Human sacrifice was not only practiced by the Mayas but also, and probably
more so, by the Aztecs.  It was a widespread practice in Mesoamerica, and
other groups also practiced it, such as the Mixtecs, the Otomi, and the
Tarascans.  There might be disagreements as to the extent and the exact
circumstances under which it was practiced (voluntary or not, etc.), but it
seems to be an undisputable fact that it was.
Blood letting, as a form of self-sacrifice, was also practiced, usually with
cactus thorns.
