Horses
Paul K. Manansala asks me:
See the article "Horses" by Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty, in The Encyclopedia
of Religion (Ed. Mircea Eliade). Vol. 6 (New York, 1987), p. 463-468.
I cannot quote the whole article; let me just quote the following (p. 463):
"Ancient Indo-European Horse Sacrifices: With the Greeks and the Vedic
Indians, and later with the Romans, the horse truly came into its own as a
religious symbol, one that pervades both myth and ritual. Rituals involving
horses, more particularly rituals that involve the killing of a white
stallion, are attested throughout the Indo-European world."
In the following she mentions ancient Norse, Greek, Roman, Persian and
Celtic ritual and mythological traditions which confirm her statement. See
also the Bibliography added to her article for further references.
But there can be no doubt that they played a major role on the ideological
level with the early Indo-Aryans. You have still to convince me that they
played a similar role in the Indus culture. As long as we cannot read the
Indus texts, you may assume anything about their contents, of course. But
does not the absence of the horse among the animals of the figurative
tradition of that culture mean anything to you?
Best regards,
