An old question
Jacob's contribution is an interesting pointer to how we might find
subtler criteria than 'living' vs. 'dead', but there are still
complications.
If a Tamil speaker uses voiced/voiceless and aspirated/unaspirated
oppositions in pronouncing stops in Tamil, could they not be said to have
a 'Sanskrit accent?'
The pair 'father-tongue/mother tongue' (for which Jacob was not
responsible) carries unwelcome implications that high culture belongs to
males, popular culture to females.
