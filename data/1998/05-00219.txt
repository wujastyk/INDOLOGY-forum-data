"Devanagari for TeX" updated.
The "Devanagari for TeX" package by Frans Velthuis has been updated. The
new version, 1.5, is a compliation of various revisions and enhancements
made to the original package. This release has been authorized by
Velthuis, and is available from CTAN (ie. ftp.tex.ac.uk) in directory
language/devanagari/.
The package now officially supports the hyphenation of Devanagari text,
the use of LaTeX size changing commands, and is fully compliant with
LaTeX2e. The manual has also been revised. The METAFONT themselves have
been changed, so all metric files (*.tfm) and printer font files (*.pk)
must be rebuilt. It is suggested that all files from previous versions be
removed.
Please direct any questions or comments to me.
Regards,
Anshuman Pandey
