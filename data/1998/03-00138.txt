Thanks for the information on Taranatha's date and Gussner's papers. I
had similar comments to make about Gussner's methodology. I was
particularly interested in seeing if he considered the theory that the
Dakshinamurti Stotra and its commentary, the Manasollasa, are originally
from the Pratyabhijna school of Kashmir Saivism. This has been proposed
before, on the basis of the word sphuraNa that has an important place in
this hymn.

A few of your own findings with respect to texts like the two-part
kenopanishad bhAshya and the vivekavUDAmaNi would also be appreciated.
