Nataraja's Earring
<<<
Nataraja wears a female earring in his left ear (kundala) while his
right ear, though pierced, is bare. One can explain this by child like
stories which say that his right earring fell off while dancing. The
truth of the matter is that Nataraja is an ardhanirshvara and therefore
must express his feminine aspect.  This is stylised by the kundala.
  Does the theme - 'NatarAja is an ardhanArizvara' figure
 anywhere in Kashmir Shaivaite texts?
 With kind regards,
 N. Ganesan
