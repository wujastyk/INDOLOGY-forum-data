I will also not comment on Chuvash and Etrurian. Nor can I 
evaluate the contributions by Indo-European studies, say,
in the last 5 decades, to enhancing methodological rigour.
While seconding Karp's above-cited observations, one might add that
these observations are equally applicable to the nearly 150 years of wasted
effort in pursing the Proto-Aryan (demography-language equation) problem. May
be 'wasted effort' is too strong a phrase; but we seem to be 
back to ground zero; it will be worth the while to look back on these years of
philological studies to list the major landmark 
accomplishments: 
In linguists, the setum = kentum divide is a major discovery; a
nother accomplishment which is noteworthy is the 
substantial decipherment of the Rigveda, excepting for the 
failure to identify Soma, which is a_tma_ yajn~asya; 
this in effect, means that the decipherment of the 
Rigveda is itself a doubtful accomplishment; 
we may ahve to hark back to Sa_yan.a of the 13th century AD for
some help to recover the lost ground.
Certainly, Karp will find a lot of warmth in South India now; 
and also a high price for onions, about Rs. 40 (about a dolar) 
a kilo.
