Indo-Aryan im/e-migration (scholarly debate)
The equation of sanskrit z to kentum k is not only between Satem and Kentum
but can easily be observed between sanskrit and dravidian languages.
This has been conveniently ignored so far.
for eg: "kutirai" can be from "azvatara"
...In addition to Tamil pari
Also, I would like to point out that tiger in kannada is "huli" and
the root "hul" in sanskrit refers "to cover or conceal", obviously
the tigers hunting techniques has been taken into consideration.
