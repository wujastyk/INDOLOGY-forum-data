Schleicher (Darwin and linguistic) is never
actual, sorry.
see H. Christmann: Sprachwissenschaft des 19. Jhts
(contains Schleicher's paper)
and see H. Arens: Sprachwissenschaft , 1969 (all
in German)
compare the so called "Wellentheorie" of Joh.
Schmidt etc.

The similarities of the IG language are n o t
monocausal
there are not one root !! there are only *-roots
(= a system of help)
