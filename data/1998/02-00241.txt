You find some references in Jan Gonda: Die Religionen Indiens, II, Der
j?ngere Hinduismus, Stuttgart 1963 (I think there came a second edition in
the meantime), p. 257. He mentions among others: E. Thurston, Omens and
superstitions of Southern India, London-Leipzig, 1912; J.v.Negelein, Der
Traumschluessel des Jagaddeva, Giessen, 1912. You also find some
observations in J.J.Meyer, Trilogie altindischer M?chte und Feste der
Vegetation, Z?rich, 1937 (see Vol.3, p. 309, headword 'Mantik').
   I am sure there has been written a lot about these things, and you
should not take 'the great silence' of RISA-L as an answer!

Best regards
