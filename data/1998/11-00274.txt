I am curious. Wouldn't this word have arisen via analogy out of
something similar? What would it be? Driving animals? Carrying
things on our back? What would you call hitching animals? Would
the word have arisen out of "tying" or "binding" or putting the
animals up front of the cart?

Would it be from walking/running or the causative version of one
of them?

I am assuming, of course, that they had not yet picked up the
habit of creating new names for things from Greek and Latin :-)
