Beluur and Belgaum
In spoken tamil, agriculture is 've.l.lAmai'.
Only in literature, we see 'vE.lANmai'.
In spoken tamil, it is 've.l.lA.lar';
In literature, they are 'vE.lA.lar'.
M. Arokiaswami, The Kongu country, being the history of
the modern districts of Coimbatore and Salem from the
earliest time to the coming of the British, Univ. of Madras, 1956
says the river name 've.l.lA.ru' and 've.l.lA.lar' are connected.
I think he has a whole chapter on this.
It seems ve.l and vE.l are connected from the above.
