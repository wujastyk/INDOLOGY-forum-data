brahmi? (was Re: Origin of Dravidian languages)
No one has answered my brahmi question, so I'm asking again.
Is it or is it not accepted that azoka's inscriptions are
the earliest extant in brahmi?
If it is, what is that mention in an article posted here of
_sixth_ (6th) century BC coins carrying a brahmi inscription?
Just a typo?
