How does a myth become a myth ?
To come up with a hundred oared ship myth -
one should first know about boats and oars.
So there might not have been a 100 oared ship, but a boat with a few
oars is definitely possible.
Also, it is important to realize that the Rgveda was not meant
to be a encyclopaedia and if something is not mentioned in it -
doesnt necessarily mean that it was unknown either.
A more realistic judgement is required.
