The horse cult is also known from Celtic religion. Consequently, if the
horse cult developed in situ about the year 2000 BCE in the Northwest part
of the subcontinent, we must assume that the Celts migrated from that area
to WEstern Europe. That is of course what some Indic writers, such as
Talageri, suggest. But it is not a very probable idea.
