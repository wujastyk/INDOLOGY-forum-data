do you receive this message as an attachment?
sorry for wasting the band width, but I would like to know if other
subscribers also receive my posts "as attachments". If you do, please
forward the entire message to: sreeni at ktp.uni-paderborn.de
I checked the Indology list archives and there I don't see my message
as "an attachment", nor the copy (of my own posting) I received.
I am puzzled ...
