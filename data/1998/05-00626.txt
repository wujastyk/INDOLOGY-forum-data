Sarayu_ and RV
Hi,
Here is a specific lexeme in the context of another language problem
related to another river:
s'ar-mu_w source of the Sarju river at the Pin.d.a_ri_ glacier
(Kumauni_). A cognate in Telugu: car-iya, car-i cliff, precipice, side
of a hill or mountain (Te.) explained in the context of a precipice.
Tamil lexicon
is emphatic: carayu a river on which stands the ancient city of
Ayo_dhya_ (Kampara_. Pa_laka_. A_r-r-up. 12)
Is this the same as Sarayu_(RV. v.53.9)?
Regards,
k.
