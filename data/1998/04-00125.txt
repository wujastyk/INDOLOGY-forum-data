May I remind some of our list members that INDOLOGY is meant to be a
scholarly forum.  Although mystical insights and experiences are perfectly
valid, they would surely be more appropriate on a list devoted to such a
perspective.  Such a list could be called INNER INDOLOGY, HIGHER INDOLOGY,
or REAL INDOLOGY, if that reflects the beliefs of those who would wish to
participate in it, but a scholarly discussion needs to remain within certain
boundaries.
