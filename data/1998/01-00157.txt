>Old Ta. uvaRu has no cognate in any other Drav. language. But u:Ru (<PD
*u:_tu) occurs in South, South Central and Central Drav. languages. So there
is no relation between OTa. uwaRu and u:Ru, the latter is NOT derived from
the former (cf. DEDR 761). DEDR does not put these as related. Coming to
kuyawa~kucawa, an intervocalic consonant is weakened and not strengthened by
a natural phonetic process. -c- [-s-] thus gets weakened to -y- and not the
other way round. The non-attestation of a form in old texts does not
invalidate its antiquity if it based on comparative reconstruction. Please
note that Ma. and Tu. also have the
-s- forms. The Vedic forms could not have been borrowed from SD in which -s-
> -y-/-0- is found. You have correctly summarized my stand on the
alternation of high and mid vowels and my position is widely accepted by
Comp Drav scholars. What PSS says matters little except where he has strong
arguments in favour of his stand. Also notice that the contracted form of
kuyawa occurs as ko: within Ta.Kota, Toda and Kannada. Emeneau derives the
name Kota from the potter word, ko:v 'a Kota man'.Regards, Bh.K.
