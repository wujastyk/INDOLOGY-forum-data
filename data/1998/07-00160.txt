could also be used to indicate "sacrificing". From this, it looks as if the
Dravidian concept of the sacrifice (vELvi) was that it was desire-based and
not praise-based. In view of the techniques of suggestion employed in these
poems, the hero's suffering in the hot dry land away from his beloved in the
course of seeking his fortune is like a sacrifice.
