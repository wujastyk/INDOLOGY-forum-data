ashish,
            you should go about your study in stages :-

1. firstly get a couple of good dictionaries - like  Sanskrit -Hindi kosh by
vAman shivrAm Apte : motilal banarsidas. Another excellent dictionary is
English to Sanskrit by Monier Williams : Southern publications, Madras.
2. Get  a grammar text like - bR^had anuvAd chandrikA by chakradhar N.
Shastri : motilal banarsidas. A Sanskrit to English grammar text is  A
higher Sanskrit Grammar by M.R.Kale : motilal banarsidas.
3. Decide which scriptures you really want to study. For sanskrit to hindi
translations pick up books on the upanishads and sUtrabhaashya from Gita
press, gorakhpur.

get going its great knowledge.  Ravi Khanna
