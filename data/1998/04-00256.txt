One does well to recall these facts of the Western tradition:  1) it was never
God's intent that Isaac actually be sacrificed; 2) there are no texts in
Judaism,
Christianity, or Islam which specify the conditions and methods of human
sacrifice.  It is indeed proscribed rather than prescribed.
With respect to Hinduism, however, the Kalikapurana does prescribe such
a ritual.
Although the practice in any case marks an aberration today, the textual
difference is, one would think, both obvious and significant.
