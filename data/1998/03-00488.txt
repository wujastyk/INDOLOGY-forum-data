Classification of...
Dear members of the net,
I am looking for an article in Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Institute,
75, 1994, p. 185-195 by Subhash C. Kak, On the classification of Indic
languages.
The university of Oslo subscribes to the ABORI, but unfortunately we don't
have the relevant issue. Is there a kind soul out there who could supply me
with a copy of the article?
Best regards,
Lars Martin Fosse
