Although there are discussions concerning prayojana in Pata;njali's Mahaa-bhaa.sya, the quoted line does not occur there. It comes from Kumaarila (probably ;Sloka-vaarttika; if not try Tantra-vaarttika), as I recall.
On the question that Sara McClintock <Sara.Mcclintock at ORIENT.UNIL.CH> asked, the sources I would expect to be generally helpful are: Kevalaananda Sarasvati's Miimaa.msaa-ko;sa (7 vols), Bhiimaacaarya Jha.lakiikara's Nyaaya-ko;sa,W.K. Lele's book on Tantra-yuktis and the Vaada treatises of Vasu-bandhu, Dharma-kiirti etc. In the first two, . one should look under pryojana as well as anubandha-catu.s.taya. 
In Hari-bhadra's Abhisamayaala.mkaaraalokaa (the title is sometimes given with a short "a" in the final syllable), there is some discussion of prayojanasya prayojanam in the opening part. It is rather difficult to follow but has been translated by Gareth Sparham in his unpublished Ph.D. thesis completed at the University of British Columbia in 1989.
