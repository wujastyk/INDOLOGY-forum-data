Sanskrit Retroflexes
        Suggestions for Dravidian role in the development are discussed in
a paper "Retroflexion in Sanskrit" by D.H. Killingley.  This paper was
published in the Proceedings of the First International Conference of
Tamil Studies, Kuala Lumpur.  International Academy of Tamil Research,
1966, pp. 596-606.  Somehow I missed this excellent paper when I published
my own paper "Genesis of Rigvedic Retroflexion".  Dr. Killingly was kind
enough to send me a copy.  The discussion of phonetic motivations in the
emergance of Sanskrit retroflexion is worth reading.
        All the best,
