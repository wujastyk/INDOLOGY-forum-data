before.
My book, India and the Hellenistic World, came out a few months ago as
number 83 of our series Studia Orientalia. It contains 10+459 pages
and the price is 200 Finnish Marks (about the same as French Francs).
It can be ordered from:
Bookstore Tiedekirja
Kirkkokatu 14
FIN-00170 Helsinki
Finland
tel +358-9-635177; fax +358-9-635017; e-mail tiedekirja at pp.kolumbus.fi
This is the place for ordering all the books published by learned
societies of Finland.
Best regards
