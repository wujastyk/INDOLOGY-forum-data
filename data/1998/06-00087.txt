Dear All
Because of several reasons I have all this spring been reading the
messages about two weeks behind. This in fact seems to be an
excellent arrangement. I have spared much time as others have already
answered and commented the messages.
Our Institute for Asian and African Studies (until recently called
Department of Asian and African Studies) has moved. The new adress is:
PJ 59 (Unioninkatu 38 B)
FIN-00014 University of Helsinki
Finland
Phone and fax numbers as well as e-mail adresses remain same as
before.
My book, India and the Hellenistic World, came out a few months ago as
number 83 of our series Studia Orientalia. It contains 10+459 pages
and the price is 200 Finnish Marks (about the same as French Francs).
It can be ordered from:
Bookstore Tiedekirja
Kirkkokatu 14
FIN-00170 Helsinki
Finland
tel +358-9-635177; fax +358-9-635017; e-mail tiedekirja at pp.kolumbus.fi
This is the place for ordering all the books published by learned
societies of Finland.

Best regards

Klaus Karttunen
