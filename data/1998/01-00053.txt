Kuyava
while we are talking of variants, may I bring up another word..
"kUyavA" which appears in the 4th anuvAka of the chamakaprashnah
and has been translated as a grain of some sort.. (according to T. R.
Rajagopala Aiyar, they are millets).

Subhaashitam: (Ancient Sanskrit Couplet)
||Kshamaa balam a-shaktaanaam; shaktaanaam bhUshaNam kshamaa|
  Kshamaa vashikrte loke, kshamayA: kim na sidhyati ? | ||
Subhashitasya anuvaadam (Translation):
Forgiveness is the strength of the weak.
Forgiveness embellishes the mighty.
In a world that can be conquered by forgiveness,
what is not possible by forgiveness?
