I beg  the pardon of  Dr.art. Lars Martin Fosse, but 
A) I am perverse enough to think  that  "the relationship between humans and
the divine powers" and "social control" are deeply correlated, and that the
study of such correlations has some interest... 
B) I think that "observable facts"  are "the facts that I observe", and that
the way I interpret them may be influenced by personal prejudice. As
Monseigneur Lamothe said to one of my friend, his student, who
misinterpreted a
point of buddhist doctrine, "Mon pauvre ami, vous serez toujours un
chr?tien"... 
C) I tried to understand the position of dharmazAstra on death penalty, an
effort I supposed connected not only with juridical anthropology, but also
with
indology. 
D) To this effect I cited medhAtithi, the oldest -- and most revered
--complete
commentary on Manu. I confess, I stupidely trusted G. B?hler, PV Kane, JDM
Derrett and a few others, who described his work as "erudite", "full of
interesting information". 
E) Worse, I even imagined that indology was a place to discuss matters of
[hindu] criminal law and penalty. I should have known better...
