    dramiDa/draviDa = Tamil in Sanskrit

K. Zvelebil, Tamil literature, E. J. Brill, 1975

p.49
"However, in early historical times, Sanskrit text composed in
the North of India show a rather unfriendly, even contemptuous,
attitude towards the Dravidians, cf. MAn. X, 44. CarakasaMhitA,
IndriyasthAna V, 28 mentions draviDa and Andraka in one breath with
CaNDaalas, pizAcas, dogs, etc., ie., with beings one should not
see in one's dreams since they are highly inauspicious.
BANa, in the kAdambarI describes the draviDa dharmika very
unfavorably (Kadambari edition, K. P. Parab, Bombay, 1921, p. 398-401)
The different kAmazAstras usually deal with the women of the South
in not too flattering terms".

p. 53
"It is obvious that the Sanskrit drAviDa, Pali damila, damiLo
and Prakrit dAviDa are all etymologically connected with
"tamizh" [48]

[48] The *r* in tamizh > drAviDa is a hypercorrect insertion,
cf. an analogical case of DED 1033 Ta. Ma. kamuku, Tu. kaGgu,
"areca palm"; Skt. kramu."

p. 59
"There is also a reference to a dramiDa saGghAta in the
commentary to DaNDin's kAvyadarza by TaruNa VAcaspati.
cf. V. Narayana Aiyar, JORM, 2, 1928, p. 149-151."

p.140
"In Saundaryalaharii 76 ascribed to zaGkara, Campantar
is called draviDazizu. For this tradition of "the boy-saint",
cf. also his other epithets, ALuTaiya piLLaiyAr ..."

Tamil literature, E. J. Brill, 1992
p. 18
"the word Dravidian, coined by R. Caldwell, in 1856 on the
base of the Sanskrit term draaviDa- found in a 7th century AD
Sanskrit author [kumArila bhaTTa], is in fact most probably
connected with the indigenous term for the Tamizh language, ie.,
tamizh, whereby the development might have been
*tamiz > *damiL > damiLa-/damila- and further, with the
intrusive 'hyper-correct' (or perhaps analogical) -r-
into draaviDa- 'Dravidian'.

cf. the forms damiLa-, damila- occuring in Prakrit, and the
alternative Sanskrit for dramila-. The -m/-v alternation is a
common phenomenon in Dravidian."

Nammalvar's TiruvAymozi is called dramiDopaniSad.
Vedanta Desikan wrote dramiDopaniSattAtparyaratnAvalI.
