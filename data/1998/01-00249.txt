more attention to the thread. In the second place nobody helped me to dig me
out of any hole. The hole you imagine is that of your own manicheistic view
of things which seems to be bound to rigid lines of thinking, missing the
possibility of exploring deeper regions beyond formal stetements. If anyone
of those who made the hostile observations about my astonishment would care
for discussing the topic, as Lars did, the whole issue would be much more
profitable.
Of course it was a fair conclusion to draw for that post festum remark and
it was  addressed exactly to the one made it and  not to those who did not
participate in the debate.In some schools of spirituality certain
provocations are made on purpose just to stir some underlying some major
feature up. If the intention is not related to negative emotion or
ideological hostility- and my original  remark WAS NOT- then the important
is that what follows. But some people stick just at that point and doesn't
want to go ahead.
