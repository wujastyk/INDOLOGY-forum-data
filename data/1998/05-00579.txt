How do you know that? Standard presumption? There simply is no means so
far to date any Avesta texts independently from the Near Eastern sources
and from correpondensces with the Vedas, see O Skjaervo in the Erdosy

"Are not usually forgotten" -- a sweeping statement. We need details. - As
I said, I have supplied such data in Erdosy 1995. No need to repeat myself
again.  My fingers are tired by now.  And Parpola has done so for 2
decades or so.
I suggest to read his papers and then come back.
