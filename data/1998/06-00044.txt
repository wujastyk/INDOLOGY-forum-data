So too indology. I find in this statement an elaboration of the
problem of method that Houben had talked about in an earlier posting
commending a study of, say, the topic of the date of the RV. The
'method' in subjective disciplines (such as indology) tends to start
with a 'model': in the case of the RV, the model tends to be either
IE-centric or I-centric with the latter moving the centre of gravity
towards the Gangetic belt. The unravelling of the 'truth' has to occur
by testing the model with 'data'.
