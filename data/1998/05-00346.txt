This posting is supposed to be  on the lighter side i.e., funny.

Has pANini the sage and grammarian embedded pornographic material
in the dry aphorisms of sanskrit grammar? People who see such things
everywhere say that the answer is 'yes'. In the following sutras,
they say, that pANini was trying to allay the most common fears of
boys at puberty (who come to study his grammar)  about their
masculinity.

hrasvaM laghu (1.4.10)
saMyOgE guru, dIrghaM ca (1.4.11-12)

According to them the word 'laghu' in the earlier sutra stands for
'laghusaGkAyAM'.

sarma.
