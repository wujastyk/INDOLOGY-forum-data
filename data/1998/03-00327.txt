Indo-Aryan migration vs Indigenous origin - scholarly debate

Dear George,
        Thank you for a very balanced and interseting comment.
        Let me emphasize that I totally share your view that one should never
blame scholars or scientists of the past for having been wrong. In fact
one of the nice things about western science and scholarship is that it
has the ability to figure out its own mistakes.
        On Frawley and Co, even a layman like me can figure out that they are
biased against anything non-Indian. This comes out also in Frawley's
attitude to Ayur-Veda. Nobody denies its value and beauty but Ayurveda
is not a cure all and neither is allopathic medicine a doomed technique
taught by quacks seeking to force ever increasing amounts of drugs on
defenseless patients as Frawley claims ! (This is a bit of an
exageration of mine actually, but only a bit)
        My point was to ask wether such works as Frawley's - clouded by
intellectual prejudice as they may be - should still be seriously
considered. Biased people can make valid points at times and I think our
exchanges on this topic in the last few days have certainly made that
clear.
        Thank you for contributing to what I thought was a very interesting
discussion of delicate topic.
