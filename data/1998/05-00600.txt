Not necessarily so. See e.g. an article by Wm. Labov, "Hypercorrection by the lower middle class as a factor in linguistic change", in Wm. Bright, _Sociolinguistics_ (The Hague/Paris. 1966), pp. 84-113.

It is precisely due to an awareness of what sort of thing is correct (but not quite understanding why) that hypercorrection can occur at all. Literacy actually increases this (plain 'literacy' is not the same as 'learning' and 'understanding').
