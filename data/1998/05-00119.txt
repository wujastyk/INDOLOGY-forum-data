I have read that the Namboothiris migrated to Kerala from the area that is
present day Maharashtra in the 5-6th century.  Are there any historical
records (inscriptions etc) to indicate where they might have migrated from
and in what period ?. Do any of their practices/customs/gotras link them
with  brahmins in other parts ?.

Thanks,
Nikhil
