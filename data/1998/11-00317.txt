While one may describe hindutva-vAda as one kind of Neo-Hinduism, should
one necessarily attach a similar label to the Sanskrit used by
hindutva-vAdins, if and when they use it?
No, not necessarily. My interest was in Sanskrit used as a medium of communication by Neo-Hindus/Hindutva people, but obviously, anybody can use Skt. for any purpose. Skt. as a language belongs neither to Hindutva nor to any other ideology in particular.
