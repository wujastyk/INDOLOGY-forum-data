Subject: A question about kumbhAr caste
Message-ID: <161227040229.23782.2523672343831665355.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Thanks to all those who responded to this query. Now if I can ask for another
favor. Does anybody know the etymology for a Maratha caste by the name kunbi?
Thanks in advance.

Regards
