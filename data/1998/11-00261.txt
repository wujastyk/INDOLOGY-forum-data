This is to inform those interested that for the first time images of
the finest ancient Indus Valley objects in Pakistani collections
are available for educational use. Shot by Dr. Mark Kenoyer
(Wisconsin) and Dr. R.H. Meadow (Harvard), they provide
a complete overview of the archaeological finds from the
1920's to the present. The color slides have printed captions.

The slides can be seen with more details at

The slides have been a great hit at US universities.
Questions can be sent to slides at harappabazaar.com.
A list of slides can also be mailed to those who request it.
