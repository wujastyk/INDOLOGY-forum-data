Phoneme /q/ in Kohistani Shina
Dear members of the list,
Can anyone suggest where to look for sources for the following vocabulary
items which contain the phoneme /q/ in Kohistani Shina?
'thooNqar, a species of frog (falling tone on the long vowel)
qur'luu, a children's game  (no data for tones)
quuNj, 'stack of firewood' (falling tone on the vowel)
ba'Raq, 'shining'
pa'Raq, 'sudden laughter'
My data includes many loanwords with /q/ (originally from Arabic) and
indigenous words with /q/. The two that are definitely of IA origin are:
qaa, 'crow' (falling tone on the vowel)
ma'noq, 'frog'
I am hoping to assign the five mystery items to one category or another.
With thanks, and best holiday wishes,
Ruth Schmidt
