Diacritics for Romanised Indic text in HTML 4.0
Subscribers to INDOLOGY who use diacritics for Romanised Indic
text on their web sites (or with Word '97) may be interested
looking at a page I've written on using these characters in
HTML 4.0 with the ISO/IEC 10646 character set:

P.S. although I've been very careful on that page to use only
plain HTML 4.0, with no non-standard tags, and verified it -
Netscape 4 occasionally seems to have problems with this page.
IE 4 works fine.
If you have a browser which doesn't understand HTML 4.0
tags you should still be able to load the page, though
you won't see the Unicode characters used in the tables
properly.
