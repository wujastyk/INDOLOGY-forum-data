Mahabharata (literal) translation in German
Dear Indologists,
Could someone tell me if a German translation of the Mahabharata is
available in print or on the web? Not in summary form (like the one
published in Diederichs GR) nor the old summaries of Holtzmann/Winternitz,
Bopp, Hertel or Porzig. I am also aware of the Mahabharata episodes (like
Nala-Damayanti) available in German. What I am looking for is a literal
translation of the sanskrit text (even partial) like Peterfalvi has done in
French or Van Buitetenen in English. Thanks in advance for your help.
