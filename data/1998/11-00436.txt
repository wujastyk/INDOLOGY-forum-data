In Tagore's collection of poems Katha o Kahini (Tales and Fables), there is
an excellent poem on Buddha and his disciple Anathpindad and their sweeping
effects on the mass.

Then, in the same book, there is another well-known poem named Pujarini
(the worshipper) that tells the story of Buddhist king Bimbisaar, his Hindu
son Ajatshatru, and the self-sacrifice of the woman Buddhist worshipper
Srimati who defied Ajatshatru's anti-Buddhist decrees.

I don't know if Katha o Kahini is translated in English or any other
language, but it would be a worthwhile project.
