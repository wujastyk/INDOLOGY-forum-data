yoga-paTTa
In the yoga sutras of Patanjali, AsanA which is one of the aSTAngAs
(which are the necessary aids) of yoga, is defined as
sthira-sukhamAsanaM
AsanA is the one that is stable and comfortable. This will be an aid in
allowing the sAdhakA to forget his body and loose himself in meditation.
Yoga-paTTa seems to help in making your posture stable and comfortable.
regards,
sarma.
