Naciketas-2
Shalom to all,
Last week I sent a message to the list, telling about my work on the
above subject.
At this stage of my work, I am mostly interested in information about
other people who are engaged now in work on Naciketas, or have been
recently working on the subject.
furthermore, I would like to get in touch with Y.K. Wadhwani, who wrote
the following articles:
Wadhwani, Y.K. - "A Semantic Study of the Term 'Naciketas'."
        Journal of the University of Poona.
        Humanistic Section, No. 37, 1972, pp. 33-36
   -  "  -  "Implications of the Vedic Term Nacikets."
        Vishveshvarananda Indological Journal. No. 11, 1973,
        pp. 19-23
Thanks in advance for your help.
