Yes. Another point I'll make here is that just people from Mysore are
hardly representative of opinions of Hindus on Vivekananda. The dvaitins
and vishistadvaitins have no reason to like V: he called dvaita and
vishistadvaita stepping stones for advaita (in that order)! However, he
is quite popular in many places, eg, Madras.
I wouldn't say V was as influential as Sha.nkara, but definitely V's
role in the giving the Indians of that time some self-confidence cannot
be denied (which was very important!). No doubt, he is not as popular
among scholars as Sha.nkara for obvious reasons. Also not so many people
have got tenure studying V's works :-) :-).
Swami Chidbhavanadar's explanation of the tiruvachagam is very lucid. I
highly recommend it if anyone's interested in that kind of thing.
