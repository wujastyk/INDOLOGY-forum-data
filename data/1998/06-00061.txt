Rajasthani chronicles compiled in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries
mention that much of western Rajasthan was depopulated between about 1330
and 1450.  They don't say why, but the Black Death might be one reason.
Another would be the Muslim policy of removing whole populations to areas
under their direct control.
