Subject: Nisus 5.1 with Arabic Language Kit
Message-ID: <161227036067.23782.1248116359698778303.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear members of the list,

Is there anyone out there who has used Nisus 5.1 with Indic fonts (such as
Norman or South Asia Times), or with the Apple Arabic Language Kit, who
would be willing to send me his/her comments on the compatibility of Nisus
with these? We are discussing an upgrade, but I hope to ascertain in
advance that I will not get any surprises when I try to use it with all my
weird and wonderful fonts.

Many thanks,

Ruth Schmidt
