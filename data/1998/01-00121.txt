solution to the "kuyava' etymology
The alternation of i/e and u/o is a Proto-South Dravidian rule, which is as
follows. Proto-Dravidian had all the four vowels i,e,u,o in the root
syllable of (C)VC type. In Proto-South Dravidian they remained as such when
high vowels or zero followed in the next syllable, i.e. (C)VC-i/u/0; but
when a lowel -a followed i,u merged with e,o; i.e.PD*(C)i/eC-a
included Malayalam) changed these sequences to i,u (rule of
dissimilation)throughout. The rest of the Southern languages preserved PSD
merged state(Kannada, Kodagu, Toda, Kota, Irula, Tulu; Telugu also joins
this group in this phenomenon). Again, Old Tamil (C)i,uC-a- later became
(C)e,oC-a in Medieval  and modern Tamil. (I published an article on this
problem in Languaage 1958 and my solution has been accepted by all Dravidian
scholars). I am not expressing an opinion on kuyawa. I am not convinced that
it has a Dravidian origin. Also note there is a group of South-Central
Dravidian languages called Ku:i-Ku:vi-Ku:bi. PD *ku: means 'to call', a
homophonous *ku: 'hill'. ko:'king, god'. The potter word is only confined to
Tamil and does not have PD etymolgy. I do not think that 'potter' and
'chieftain, king' words are related.
