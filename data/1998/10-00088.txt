This the first issue that is made available on the net at once in various
formats (PDF, DVI, PS). A few early issues have been available in PDF
format and are  readable by acroreader (downloadable from our web site).
At present, all issues since 1995 are on our web site the way
they have been published, that is in simple (7 bit) ASCII format using the
Kyoto-Harvard transcription. They can be read and downloaded in this
format.
Other formats of these earlier issues are to be added soon, as to
facilitate reading and printing with the usual Indological transcription.
