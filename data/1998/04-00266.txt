human sacrifice (allusion to Abraham)
The child sacrifice, first attested in Tamil texts,
(it appears in Telugu and Marathi later) and a comparison
to the Western traditions (Abraham, etc.,) is well
analyzed in
David Shulman, The hungry God, Hindu tales of filicide and devotion.
U. Chicago press, 1993
Can someone still summarize the child sacrifice, blood letting amidst
Mayas, please. (I will contact the Mayan experts, provided by
Dr. L. Patton little later).
