access to it:

Title:  smRti saMgraha
        SarasvatInilaya Press
        Madras 1879
        (in Telugu characters)
As the title says it is a collection of smRti-s. I would be grateful for
the table of contents, or a list of the smRti-s which are printed in the
book. Any related information is highly welcome.
Thanks for reading
