Puri: Jagannatha Temple: Relics
Cholas, ardent Saivaites, built some temples on their
parent's ashes. Those Siva temple inscriptions explicitly
state they are built so. (paLLippaTai iiccaram).
For the list of sites, consult S. R. Balasubrahmanyam,
multivolume series on Chola temples. I think
Rajendra,I built a paLLippaTai temple for his mother
near Darasuram.
