   However, at about 2000 BC a new and remarkable archaeological
culture appeared east of the Urals, apparently at least partially
derived from a late Yamna variant (the Poltavka culture) on the
middle Volga. This new group, the Sintashta-Petrovka culture,
established compact, heavily fortified settlements in the northern
steppes east of the Urals; engaged in bronze metallurgy on  an
unprecedented scale; raised herds of cattle, sheep, and horses;
and practised complex mortuary rituals that parallel in many specific
details the Aryan rituals described in the Rig-Veda (Anthony &
Vinogradov 1995 ; Gening et al. 1992; Kuzmina 1994: 226-8; Parpola
1995). Vehicles, buried in the richer Sintashta-Petrovka graves,
as they had been earlier in Yamna graves, now included spoke-wheeled
chariots, buried with two-horse chariot teams. Recent AMS
dates of 2000 BC have established that these are the oldest
directly dated chariots (or, some would argue, proto-chariots) in the
ancient world.(2) It is likely that Sintashta-Petrovka represents
the ancestral Indo-Iranians, whose traditions were later carried
into India and Iran.
