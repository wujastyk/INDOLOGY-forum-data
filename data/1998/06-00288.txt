vous (Sudalaimuthu Palaniappan <Palaniappa at AOL.COM>) avez ?crit :
The lines are almost exactly like this in U.V.S. 's edition (p.212)
except that it says "tammoTu kUTi ..." at the end ....
The reference is Canto XIX, lines 107-109
There is a "joint translation" by Danielou (he did not do much...)
and T.V.Gopal Iyer (ISBN 0-8112-1097-9 or ISBN 0-8112-1098-7)
that reads, on page 81 (description of an audience hall):
"It was the work of the best craftsmen from the cool
 Tamil country, together with sculptors from Magadha,
 skilled in working rare stone, goldsmiths from the Maratha
 country, blacksmiths from Avanti, and Greek (Yavana)
 carpenters. ........."
