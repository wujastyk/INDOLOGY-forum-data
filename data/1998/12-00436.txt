question
Can anyone tell me whether and where Asko Parpola has published his "From
istar to Durga: Sketch of a Prehistory of India's Feline-riding and
Buffalo-slaying Goddess of Victory," which I have from him only in a
draft? I would also like to know Dr. Parpola's email address if possible.
Thanks,
