I would like to add that in "bAlakanakamaya" the
anupallavi consists of invocation (saMbOdhana). Keeping
saMbOdhana at the end of sentence is not natural for
conversational telugu. Usually it is at the beginning of the
sentence. (Ofcourse there are exceptions to this in metric
poetry). But for the bhAva to come out naturally the conversational
structure and intonation  will be of great help. Both of
these are satisfied by starting with anupallavi. The dhAtu
starts with madhya sthAyi pancama with a general upward trend
reaches the tAra madhyama near the beginnig of pallavi and
then has a general trend of going down reaching madhya shaDja
at the end of the pallavi. This is in agreement with the
speech intonation of a sentence starting with saMbOdhana.
Usually invocation involves an ascending pitch and
questioning (ElA) involves a high pitch. End of a sentence
(virAma) corresponds to low pitch. Knowledgeable people say
that the beauty of tyAgarAjA's compositions lies in this frequent
blending of the musical notation with speech intonation. Afterall
in his compositions the bard is conversing with his ishTa dEvata
rAma. We have also to remember that the earliest sishyAs and
vidvans who sang the compositions of tyAgarAja knew conversational
telugu very well and preserved this aspect.

        This also answers the question why in tyAgarAjA's
compositions we do not find the complete rAga swarUpa which we
find in dikshitar's compositions. Dikshitar's compositions
are mostly descriptive in nature. No conversation is involved.
He can give the complete rAga structure without any fear of
going against the intonation. But tyAgarAja has to confine
himself to those phrases of the rAga which agree with the
general intonation in speech of the sahitya.

sarma.
