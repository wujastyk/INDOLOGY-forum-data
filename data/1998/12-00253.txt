In the Sanskrit MPS instead of a single individual (the brahmin
veThadIpaka) another group of people appears, the "viSNudvipIyaka
brAhmaNa-s", called after the locality viSNudvIpa. The Chinese versions
point into the same direction. Bareau considers them as just another group
living in the neighbourhood of Kuzinagara (as to the geography, he refers
in a footnote to an article of Voegel, JRAS 1907). He overlooks the
peculiarity of the fact that the Pali version here mentions an individual
and not a group. But since the Pali version generally represents the oldest
tradition, I think you are fully entitled to take this anomaly seriously.

I am afraid the texts do not contain much useful information (and that
means that we are free to speculate!). According to the Pali commentary
literature, there was also a king VeThadIpaka who was a friend of the king
of Allakappa (see Malalasekera, DPPN).
