Gee, I thought Indologists were a bunch of rather dry and at times
boring scholars ! You certainly do not qualify for that description !
Thank you for pointing out forcefully what is wrong with Vivek?nanda in
your view. It was very interesting to hear that view and I will
certainly keep it in mind.
I would think that the discussion of the last few days showed that the
interaction between specialists and generalists - or even amateurs in my
case - can be quite positive and fruitful.
