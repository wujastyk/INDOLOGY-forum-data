Dear members,
It has been alleged in non specialized pblications that the seals of the
Indus valley have now been deciphered thanks to the work done by a
Dr.Natwar Jha (apparently a sansckrit scholar and school principal in
West Bengal) and by a mathematician, named N.S. Rajaram of Bangalore. Is
this serious and do we laymen have to assume that the Indus scripthas
now been cracked ?
Regards
Charles
