Martin Luther university, Germany
There is a news item in DinamaNi, the tamil edition of
Indian Express on 17-March-98.
It talks of several diaries, handbooks, etc of Germans
writings about tamils, s. india etc., for about 300 years.
They are in a bad deteriorating shape in Martin Luther
university. Anyone who knows what is there?
catalogs? papers on the collections?
They should go to Indological depts in the west or india??
Any thoughts,
N. Ganesan
