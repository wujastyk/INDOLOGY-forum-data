I don't have any trouble with this. I have repeatedly said that I think of
early Vedic, at least, as an Indo-Iranian culture, rather than as an Indic
one, yes. But it becomes more Indic and less Indo-Iranian as time goes by,
and as it migrates, like a swift, long-winged zyena [= Avestan zaEna],
deeper and deeper into the sub-continent, carrying soma [= Av. haoma] on
its very strong back.

Now I am sorry if my belief in the migration thesis offends Vidhyanath Rao.

Best wishes,
