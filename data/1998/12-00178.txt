Indologists,
I apologise for responding again to his blinkered statements, but this
will hopefully be the last one.
This is like saying that the standard of living of the plantation owners
in the southern US 'improved' after the introduction of slavery. By your
yardstick, the southern African economy too 'improved' after apartheid
was introduced. Or is your perceived 'economic development' (which is
moot) the only yardstick for improvement? Ever bothered to consider
the viewpoint of the victims?
