Attachments
   Oh, no! I get all those darn attachments. And Herr Fosse is not the only
one on the list I get them from. I have text-only capabilities and have
only one megabyte mail storage, so the attachments add up. Sometimes,
they are three times longer than the message! Please read your MS card!
                                Thanks Ever,
                                   Bradley A. Esparza
