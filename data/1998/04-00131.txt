Plants, animals, and Humans
I am interested in knowing ancient Indian views (Vedic and Upanishads
period) on the relationship of humans, animals, and plants.  As I
understand, animals, humans and plants were considered a part of
"prakriti" (nature) with inter-dependence and distinctive roles for each
other.  Plants were also considered to have life with several senses
(hearing, touch, etc.).  The role of plants to provide food to animals and
humans was also obvious.  There are several hymn in Vedas on the worship
of plants. Is there any article/book on the topic, especially in view of
science.
