Yiddish translation of Gita (?)
Who is to say one language is not of value, be it dead, dying or alive. I
thought this is a list for people on an intellectual quest. How can
intellect survive amidst prejudice? Yiddish is alive and well among people
that love it and those that have no need for it can stand aside.
I'm sure every language started out as an "exclusive vehicle of
communication
between members of a certain community". Didn't yours?
If translation of Gita into Yiddish does not make sense to you, so be it.
I'm sure it makes perfect sense to many. You are entitled to your opinion,
but let's
not air our prejudices on this list. Its place is perhaps another forum.
