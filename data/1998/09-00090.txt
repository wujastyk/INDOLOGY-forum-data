New Delhi 1971; pp. 189-200] writes on the matter:
"... Various terms for the unknown quantity are met with in the Hindu
mathematical literature, e.g. yavat-tavat, yadrccha, vanccha, varna,
kamika, gulika and avyakta.
...For the equations the various technical terms used were sama-karana,
sami-karana, sadrsi-karana, etc. The Sthananga-sutra classifies them
according to the powers of unknown quantity into the following: the simple
(yavat-tavat), the quadratic (varga), the cubic (ghana) and the biquadratic
(varga-varga)...
...For writing algebraic equations it is necessary to use some kind of
symbols for the unknown quantities, symbols of operations, powers and
roots. For unknown quantities we have noticed the practice of using a
symbol for zero or vacant place in the Bakhshali MS. The use of the letters
of the alphabet is strongly indicated by the use of the word varna (letters
of the alphabet). Various colour names, e.g. kalaka (black), nilaka (blue),
pita (yellow), lohita (red), or abbreviations of the names of precious
gems, e.g. ma (for manikya, ruby), ni (for indra-nila, sapphire), mu (for
mukta-phala, pearl), etc., served this purpose..."
