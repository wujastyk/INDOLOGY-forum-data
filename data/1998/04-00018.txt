arma-, armaka 'ruined site'
Dear list members,
I remember having read a verse in RGveda (page 583 in Indian edition by
Griffith, I believe it is 10th mandala) which says 'O Agni, you successfuly
quelled the hateful dASas and AryAs'. (Or look for AryAs in index to find the
verse, that is how I found it.)
Doesn't this mean the vedic tribes were other than both dAsAs and AryAs?
