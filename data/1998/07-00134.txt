##Thrice pounded fine rice flour should be thoroughly mixed with eighth part
clarified butter (ghee). Then dilute with enough water so it makes a thick
flow.
Then spread a little ghee on an iron pot  (preheated on a stove) and then
spread
the (prepared) flour. When it develops barley size holes, cover and remove
after cooked.
These ghaavanaas are to be eaten with milk and sugar and have the same
properties as rice.

My  book also has a recipe for maNDaka (termed maa.nDe in Marathi) and it is
like a very thin
and crisp version of roTii. It is to be roasted on the BOTTOM part of a clay
pot (sort of like
the Crepes) but it uses a thick kneaded dough, rather than  batter! The word
probably refers to
the shape, the professional versions are indeed as big as 1.5 feet in diameter!
(They just use a big
skillet and not a clay pot though!)
The apuupa is also mentioned in the and is basically Cream of Wheat mixed with
brown sugar and deep
fried in ghee. So not quite a pancake!
