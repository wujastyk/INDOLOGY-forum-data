Sorry for the confusion caused by my translation.
In both sculpture and texts (eg., tEvAram),
'Siva is explicitly shown and told of wearing
FEMALE ear rings (tOTu).

Reagards,

------------------------------------

The passage cited by Ganesan need not indicate a female earring.  The
kings and other folks in the society used to wear Kundalas, the
ear-rings.  Wearing an earring was a common thing for Pandits in
Maharashtra until my grand-father's time.  There are instances of kings
honoring a Pandit with a gift of an earring ( = bhikbaaLii in Marathi).
Male children have their ears pierced in Maharashtra to this day.  My
ears
were pierced as a child and this came handy when I acted in zaakuntalam
and maalavikaagnimitram as the king (during my college days in Pune),
and
I had to wear the Kundalas.  I have a photograph of myself as Duzyanta
to
prove it.
        Best,
                                Madhav Deshpande
