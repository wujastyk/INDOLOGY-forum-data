*Because other things are not different.  Hittite *has* a nominative

*-ti, etc.  What put Hrozny on the track of Hittite as an IE language

*As a crude measure, if we take the Swadesh list of the 100 most basic

     Thanks for your explanation. Can you please contrast the
     features of syntax ? Are there any better lists than Swadesh 100?
     I remember that there was a list of 1000.

*Well, animate and inanimate are genders too, grammatically speaking.
*What happened after the split-off of Hittite, is that the other
*languages divided the animate gender into "masculine" and "feminine"
*words, which resulted in a 3-gender system (masc., fem. and inanimate
*(neuter)).  It is tempting to see that in the context of a
*"masculinization" of society, but I doesn't necessarily follow.


      Interesting. Is it an accepted view that animate/inanimate(A-I)
      classification is *prior* to the 'evolution' of the three genders?
      I was curious about the animate/inanimate because Sumerian
      has this (A-I)feature and Tamil and some of the indian languages
      have this feature, but not many IE languages seem to have
      this feature. Now, of course, English and a few other
      modern IE languages are 'evolving into' this state of
      'losing masculine/feminine gender', gramatically speaking,
      I don't know how many IE languages have (or had) this
      animate/inanimate feature.

      Thanks for your remarks,

      Selvaa
