Yes, I agree, and I'm the final arbiter where this particular list is
concerned.  INDOLOGY is my baby, and although it has grown up now into a
wayward teenager, I can still exert some parental control occasionally.

Adrian Burton's information about the Indian Language Keyboard program
was a testimonial from a happy customer, not an advertisement by a
commercial concern.  There's a difference.

One of the characteristic behaviours we see in these commercial companies
who have despoiled our list recently is that they join the list, post
their adverts, and immediately resign again.  Probably this is done
automatically by a spamming machine, though I don't know for sure. Adrian,
however, is an ordinary member of the list, and has not (as of a minute or
two ago, at least) resigned!  As I have said in the past, the very
*essence* of INDOLOGY is that it is a conversazione, and it is as
important to listen as to speak.  A hundred years ago we would have been
gathering in a salon to exchange the latest in gossip, academic and
artistic development, politics, and so on; today we have a listserv group.

Those of you who just read and write to INDOLOGY as "end users" will not
be aware of the amount of editing and filtering work that goes on behind
the scenes, especially by Chris Wooff and Alan Thew at Liverpool, and to a
lesser extent by me.  This is necessary in order to cope with difficulties
of various kinds, some technical and some personal.  The recent posters of
advertisements to INDOLOGY have all been permanently banned from joining
the list, and one of them, from Alpana Arts, has subsequently sent
insulting email, containing swearwords, to the Liverpool crew.  A true
vulgarian.
