Early Giithaa sculptures
Atleast from the time of Adizankara, gitA has been considered
as one of the important texts of Hinduism. Adizanakara has
written commentaries on
1)brahmasUtrAs
2)Principal upaniSads
3)bhagavadgItA
These three are called "prasthAnatrayam" in Hinduism.
The latter philosophers have more or less followes suit
and written commentaries on the above. The respectability
of a system of philosophy was measured by the ability
of that school to interpret these triple texts in
its favour.
