Indo-Aryan invasion
Jacob Baltuch wrote:
The relative lack of linguistic diversity in Indo-Aryan is due to a
great extent to the unifying action of standard languages in combination
with political and cultural configurations, which for a very long period
have counteracted all disintegrating factors there may have been. This
happened not only for a much longer period than was the case in Europe
but also on a larger geographical scale.
