This situation is no longer a problem if instead of two separate migrations of
Indo-Aryans and Iranians one only assumes one -very early - migration of Indo-Iranians.
The subsequent period may then have been one of both divergence of Iranian(s) and
Indo-Aryan(s) due to geographical, economical and political factors, and of convergence
due to uninterrupted contacts of neighbouring groups (Avesta - Rgveda) and to internal
migration (Iranians into Indian territory but certainly also Indians into Iranian
territory).
The theory of a double migration is perhaps the strongest impediment to a proper
understanding of both Iranian and Indian history.
