Samadhi
In _Vision of the Vedic Poets_, Jan Gonda links the Sanskrit dhi with
dhyaana (and I believe with Samaadhi as well), with particular reference to
Patanjali's Yoga and also with Buddhist developments.  I've found his
excursis on this relationship quite useful and I would highly recommend
checking it out.  I'm not sure what the current attitude in Indological
circles is towards his text at the moment, though.
All the Best,
