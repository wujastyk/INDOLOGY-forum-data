I know little about cuniform and depend on transliterations. But I
guess the point is that other words that are from I-Ir/IA relating to
Mittani (such personal names or -wartana in the Kikkuli text)
show no such loss of w/v.

Diakonoff wants to see Yama in urvana, via Iranian urvan, soul.
This can be waved away pointing out that in Vedas, Varuna is also
connected to death. But the claim that Mittanis were specificaly IA
becomes weaker. That is all I was trying to point out.

We won't, unless centum traces in Bangani turn out be real :-)
