REVISED JOB POSTING (Bibliography of Asian Studies)
Anyone interested in this position, who might want to be employed for
*more than half-time*, should contact me. We have grant monies to
support more of the same work up to an additional half-time (for a
total of thirty to forty hours per week), for someone who could take
this position and work here with me at Columbia University Libraries.
