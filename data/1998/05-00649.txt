Did I not just give a number of hints that Vasistha may be linked to Iran

These items need to be discussed OR SILENCE IS APPROPRIATE.
We do not need simple OPINIONS such as the one above.
That could be done on any india.alt list.
See above. DETAILS?
(for Visnu check Mayrhofer EWA + KEWA! There are several possibilities
here)
First, we have to deal with the RV. Not with the *much* later Epic (which
copies + re-interprets Vedic data).
Indeed, the Mira+Varuna-dropped-seed-into-a-lake (puSkara) birth of
Vasistha (RV 7.33, I forgot last time) is another trick to circumvent his
unclear origins (speaking in Kuruksetra, he says "from across the Indus"
NB!)
Not from the EAST. I quoted the RV passage already... FACTS! not
opinions...
This is, I am afraid, and it must be said finally, pure ignorance!
First. The RV was not written either at 1500 nor at 500 BC. But composed
and preserved ORALLY. All of this really is first year Vedic. Remember
Prof.Krishanmurti's exasperation? -  I WILL NO LONGER PROVIDE such
basic info. There is other work to do.
Second, how do you get from the archaic language of the RV to the Prakrit
spoken by the Buddha at or shortly after 500 BC? Or to Asoka's Prakrits,
c.  250 BC??? Or Patanjali's Sanskrit 150 BC???
Instead, the development of the Vedic language inside the Vedic texts
(five !! stages) indicates that a *long* time was needed to get from A to
B (RV to Upanisads). And Buddha's Prakrt. And Patanjali.
examples or SILENCE!
Maybe, maybe.... opinions...  The case is so special that I chose it.
It is NOT a horse burial. But one of a man whose head was removed and
SUBSTITUED by that of a horse. Plus Yama's flute at his feet.

First look at the reports, then judge!
Read again.I did not say RV burial. The myth is attested in RV. <<The area
from where many (not all) of the RV traits are supposed to come from.
That's why the Dadhyanc case is so interesting. (Plus, chariots etc.
Another discussion. >>
ALAM!!!  tUSNIM bhavatu!
