This I am afraid may list most items of Ayurveda, but a few
of your interest as well.

Hope the list members will appreciate my this style instead of the
the previous detailed emails, which were objected to earlier for
being long, boring and useless for many.

If any of you prefer the previous style, do please inform me
accordingly.
