               Proceed to "SEARCH" button
"Sanskrit Studies" + "Botany"
               Proceed to "SEARCH" button
The following selections may not be of direct interest, but ....
"Sanskrit Studies" + "History of Pure and applied sciences"
               Proceed to "SEARCH" button
In the TITLE input box :
"*ved*"  in combination with  "*plant*"
This I am afraid may list most items of Ayurveda, but a few
of your interest as well.
Hope the list members will appreciate my this style instead of the
the previous detailed emails, which were objected to earlier for
being long, boring and useless for many.
If any of you prefer the previous style, do please inform me
accordingly.
