Kusunda et al.
I give brief replies to the comments and questions of Dr. Vidal; --Bh.K.

The phonological environments of the sound changes involving PD *k and *c in
Kur.-Mlt.-Brah. are atypical and they are retained as such in all the three
lgs. Sharing of atypical phonological environments in independent
developments is unexpected [Ruhlen below is wrong]. Such environments
remaining the same after 2000 years is also rare. What is most crucial is
*v- to b- which was an IA sound change of Eastern and Central lgs. By their
location all three ND lgs got influenced by this areal sound change. This is
one of the arguments that Brahui speakers moved to N-W from east India.
Because, the IA lgs that surround it now, Punjabi, Sindhi and Lahanda
retained OIA *v. Brahui has many words with b- that it borrowed from Persian
and Arabic. But where does it get the change of Drav. *w- becoming b-? It
shares this with Kur.-Mlt.
Not correct--Bh.K.
