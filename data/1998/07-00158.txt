B.rhatii edn particulars
This is a question for Miimaa.msaa specialists and librarians on the list.
I have four volumes of Prabhaakara's B.rhatii published in the Madras University Sanskrit Series. They are numbered I, II, IV and V. However, between II (published as MUSS no. 24 in 1962) and IV (published as MUSS no. 25 in 1964), I do not find any text missing that could have required another volume. Is the absence of volume III then due to an error in numbering? Are there any sets in which the numbering is corrected?
