Dear List Members,

Here is one inscription in ancient Pehlavi found at Behuistan (or
Naqsh-i-Rustam?) in Iran which dates to the 4th century B.C.E. and is
ascribed to the Achameanian (Hakkamanishiya) Emperor Daryush or
Drayavayush (Darius in Greek):

"Adam Daryavayush,
KshAyatiya VAzraka,
KshAyatiya KshAyatiyanAm,
PArshya, PArshya Puthra,
Arya Arya Chithra."

Loosely rendered in Sanskrit it could read:

"Aham Daryavayush,
Kshatriya VirAta,
KshatrAnAm Kshtra,
PArshya, PArshya Putra,
Arya Arya Vamsa."

In English it would read:

"I am Darius,
The Great King,
King of Kings,
Am a Persian, of Persian Descent
An Aryan or Aryan Lineage."

This is one actual description of a king of himself as an Aryan.
