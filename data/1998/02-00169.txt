Ukraine (former Soviet Union). From my childhood I was very much
interested both in Science (Astronomy, Mathematics, Physics) and in
Ancient Wisdom (Philosophy, Religion, Ancient Literature and History).
To combine the diametrical interests was not easy. I joined Physics
Department of Odessa University with specialisation in Astrophysics and
Mathematical Physics.
Simultaneously I attended evening classes of University in Latin
Language, Ancient Greek and Roman Philosophy, History and Literature as
well as in Hebrew and Bible Studies. At that time I had not heard
anything about Indian Civilisation and its achievements in Sciences and
Technology. First I was attracted by Philosophy and Yoga System of
Aurobindo Ghosh. Then I started reading Gita, Upanishads etc. It was not
clear and I decided to learn Sanskrit. Unfortunately in my country there
is not a single course in Sanskrit nowhere. Same situation was in nearby
Russia. So I decided to leave for India with purpose to study Sanskrit
there. I left my Physics course (completed only two years(4 terms) out of
Five-Year Integrated Baccalaureate Masters Degree Course) to fulfil my
burning desire to Penetrate in Wisdom of Ancient Indian Scientists and
Rishis. Oh, What a great misfortune, I cannot find out in India any
Sanskrit course in English medium for foreigners like myself. And also
nobody is interested in it. I am here for the last
1.5 years and trying to do on my own, but it is very slow process. I need
some guidance and friendly help.
Now I appeal to You. Sir, please instruct me, what
should I do to quench my thirst for knowledge and wisdom.
Sincerely Yours,
Viktor V. Sukliyan
P.S. I live now in Sree Chaitanya Gaudiya Math, Sector 20-B, Chandigarh,
Punjab, India where I help this organisation with Computing.
