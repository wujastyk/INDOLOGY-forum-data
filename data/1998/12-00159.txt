Let's not be too serious about it.

After several years spent in India (teaching in one of the central
universities there), I believe I can recognize the Indian students' way of
making fun of what they think are puffed up authorities - and of exploding
what they think are pompous views.

I suspect - no, I'll bet anything that - the message posted by Ved Acharya
to Usenet (if it were posted there at all) is nothing else but a viciously
puerile hoax. [Cf. the phrase "purportedly of Ved Acharya" used by Bapa Rao
in his posting of 4.12.98.]

And there is nothing better than Internet to challenge the currently hot
issues by publicizing them in a form that reduces them ad absurdum. In
order, one may suspect, to elicit from those in the positions of authority
(political/religious) more studied and balanced opinions.
