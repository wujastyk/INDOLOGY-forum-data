Subject: pUrva mImAMsA question
Message-ID: <161227041290.23782.13554262421662696823.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Perhaps I should rephrase my earlier question to emphasize the problem,
when working with standard mImAMsA principles, as applied to the
karmakANDa of the veda. We can come to the jnAnakANDa and the issue of
moksha later.

What does it mean, to have a statement that is a niyama or a parisaMkhyA
injunction, but with no eligible person on whom anything is enjoined?

Two followup questions - has Louis Renou's "Sankara: Prolegomenes au
Vedanta" been translated into English? One of the essays in this work is
on pUrva mImAMsA, as handled by Sankara. Also, who is the publisher of
the 1951 French edition?

Thanks,
Vidyasankar
