However, my recommendations are a lot simpler (at least for a start). I
am simply
asking for a standardization of semantic distance. 
LMF: First of all: I was not referring specifically to linguistics or semantics, although these disciplines are certainly affected by the general problems I try to describe. Now a "standardization of semantic distance" sounds interesting. Could you be more specific here? Are you thinking of the amount of semantic "material" that is common to certain languages (such as: A and B speakers understand 20% of each other's language), or are you talking about the development of a certain root or stem?
And that necessitates
the use of
the concept of distance. Nobody can go far without it. Once the concept
of distance
becomes embedded in linguistics many problems will solve themselves.
LMF: I wish it were that easy. You really owe us a precise definition of such a distance.

The more difficult a problem is the more powerful the tools must be.
LMF: I couldn't agree more. I think we would all like to adopt that sentence as our morning mantra. It is just finding those tools, and find a way to calibrate them. You see, it is so terribly difficult to experiment with the past. (Not counting Thor Heyerdahl, who has proved beyond a shadow of doubt that people in the old days could sail anywhere in a shoebox).

Linguistics has been blessed with lots of measurable things so it is in
much better
shape than say, psychology or even parts of sociology. If math is good
enough for them,
for physicists, engineers and everyone else, it is good enough for
linguists.
It's irrational to deny it or claim the opposite.
LMF: I couldn't agree more. But as I said, there is a busy little group of linguists just wallowing in computers and statistics, analysing Shakespearean drama by means of clustering techniques and what not. The fact is: Some problems in linguistics and philology are numerical problems, and in the past, philologists have not unfrequently made themselves look silly when handling such problems. However, not ALL problems are numerical, and not EVERYTHING can be quantified. And statistics or maths will not always produce interesting answers to the really interesting questions. 
LMF: Some questions have to be dealt with by other means, and then we are back to our data sets.
The worst that can happen is that at least some of the more farfetched
claims and
ridiculous and fuzzy methodologies will be clearly seen for what they
are. 
LMF: Again, could you please be more specific? What would you call ridiculous and fuzzy methodologies?
Understanding
is the key to a solution.
LMF: Isn't it always?
First analysis, then synthesis.
LMF: Isn't that what we are doing?

One does not need complete sets. Economists are faced with this problem
and have devised ways to get around it.
LMF: This is an interesting remark. I always thought that linguists/philologists should "read around" in other fields of knowledge to see if they could pick up new ideas to experiment with. My own assumption regarding data sets is that there is a kind of critical limit: When you are past that limit, the data set is basically clear and unambiguous, even it is not entirely complete. (it is like an ordinary puzzle: when you have assembled most of the puzzle, you understand what the motive is, even if you haven't got all the details). Unfortunately, very often we are not even close to that critical limit. If you could offer us a practical remedy, most of us would probably be quite happy.
