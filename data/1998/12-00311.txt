Dear Asish,

I want to know what view N. Ganesan is adamantly holding.
I usually give reasons, quotations from academic works, references
along with what I say.

You said in Indology that Dravid is used in Sanskrit
in the meaning of "Wealth".

Simply this is not true, according to great Indian
Sanskrit vidhvans. Of course, we can create one today.
