Deciphering the Indua valley script
There was an interesting discussion on the Aryan "invasion" / "migration"
theories about a year back in the listserv of Religion in South Asia
(American Academy of Religion).  It can be found at:
http://www.acusd.edu/~lnelson/risa/d-iaryan.txt
There is annotated biblio as well on this topic, but nothing on the Indus
script.
Best wishes, Vasudha
