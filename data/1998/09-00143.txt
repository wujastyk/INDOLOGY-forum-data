librairies parisiennes

Dear Dominique Thillaud,I would try the librairie de l' Institut de
Civilisation Indienne ( 52 Rue du Cardinal Lemoine). It's in the Quartier
Latin not far from the Coll?ge de France. They as a rule have everything you
want in this respect. But being in Paris you might as well phone Madame
Isabelle Szelagowwski 44271828, she will know if the book is there or not.
