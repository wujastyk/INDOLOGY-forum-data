Chola memorial temples
Dear Dr. Ganesan,
Thank you so much for this fascinating material on the Chola temples.
The Deva-raja and funerary issues surrounding SEA temples has been very
controversial. Human bones and ashes have been found under a number of
Javanese temples as well, but agreement on the meaning  has not been
without a great deal of debate. I shall have a very good time pursuing
this new (to me) Chola material. Thanks again.
Mary
