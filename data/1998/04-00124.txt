Here is one reference from the UpaniZads that sheds some light on the
qualification for actually understanding the knowledge contained in the Vedas.
yasya deve para bhaktir
yatha deve tatha gurau
tasyaite kathita hy arthAH
prakAZante mahAtmanaH
"Only unto those great souls who have implicit faith in both the Lord and
the spiritual master are all the imports of Vedic knowledge automatically
revealed." (ZvetAZvatara UpaniSad 6.23)
