pots, brahmin names, and potters
Dear Dr. Simson,
In a message dated 98-12-11 09:57:32 EST, you write:
<< This is the kumbha that later on
 (51.17) is given to the brahmin who in the Pali MPS is called doNa and in
 the Sanskrit version dhUmrasagotra. >>
I would appreciate if you could give the traditional explanation of the name
dhUmrasagotra. Also is this a common name for brahmins? Thanks in advance.
Regards
S. Palaniappan
