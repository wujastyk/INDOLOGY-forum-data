I may some more pieces of information (also referring to S.Krishna's
message on this topic):

Portuguese "defectors" formed part of the armies of Vijayanagara,
Bijapur, Ahmadnagar etc. from very early in the sixteenth century.
Their main value in warfare was their expertise in the use of
firearms. Pedro Alvares Cabral's account demonstrates, how Indian
rulers became convinced by the military efficiency of firearms very early
after the arrival of the Portuguese, especially for nautical enterprises.

As early as 1503 two Milanese connon makers, being
brought to India, switched over from the Portuguese to the famous
Zamorin (Samudri Raja). In 1506 already, the Zamorin's fleet
had been equipped with cannons and protectory measures
against artillery bombardment.

The "Asian cannon" has been in use in the 15th century, as David D.
Saran demonstrated, but their rather limited use was confined to land
warfare. Besides, there is no hint on cannons on bord of the Chinese exploration
fleets either. It was only after the arrival of the Portuguese in India and
European methods of casting that firearms became the decisive tool in
warfare. Compare Pearson, M.N., The Portuguese in India, Cambridge 1987
[= The new Cambridge history of India 1,1], p.57ff; Subrahmanyam,
Sanjay, The career and legend of Vasco da Gama, Cambridge 1997, p.111ff

Does anyone know, when and how "top" was introduced into North Indian
languages? To my knowledge, "top" doesn't occur in early bhakti
poetry, which doesn't prove much, however.

Kind regards, Heinz Werner Wessler
