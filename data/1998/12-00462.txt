SV: creation of human kind
Hi all
Sumarian civilization is considered to be the first Civilization
dating back to 3000BC from the history books.
But Geeta was dating back to 5561 BC [Ref. The scientific
Dating of Mahabharata by Dr.PV.Vartak] which is contradicting
the history books that Sumarian is the first civilization.
can you through some more light on this?
thanks
krishna
