CSX+ fonts now available
A large set of fonts implementing the CSX+ character set is now available
on my server. Either connect to the URL below and follow the link to
"fonts", followed by the link to "csx+", or use ftp to connect
anonymously to bombay.oriental.cam.ac.uk, and then change directory to
/pub/john/software/fonts/csx+.
Enjoy!
