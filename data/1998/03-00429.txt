Origins of fire (was: Origins of the Caste) in Ancient India
Rolf Heiner Koch wrote:
The locus classicus for the origin of the sacrificial(!) fire is the story
of PurUravas and UrvazI, ZatapathabrAhmaNa 11.5.1. Here the fire (belonging
to the Gandharvas) originates indeed from two pieces of wood (araNI),
either from a piece of azvattha wood and a piece of zamI wood or from two
pieces of azvattha wood (11.5.1.15-17).
