An example of sva as an adjective:
	sve sve karmaNy abhirataH samsiddhiM labhate naraH (Bhagavad
Gita).  The adjectival use of sva is as old as Vedic: uta svayaa tanvaa
saMvade kadaa nv antar varuNe bhuvaani (RV).  In Zakuntala, we find
adjectival use of sva:  saa nindantii svaani bhaagyaani baalaa ...
	Thus there is nothing non-sensical about svayor maataapitroH.
