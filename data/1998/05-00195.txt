>?From what I know, there is a ziva temple here in this town which stands
at the confluence of the kr*SNa and mAlAprabhA rivers. The confluence
(kannaDa kUDala, samskrt saGgama) coupled with Izvara seems to have
become kUdala saGgamEzvara. As regards etymology, since kUdala= saGgama,
why wasn't this place simply called "sangamEzvara"
or "kUDAlEzvara"...why the doubling of the "kUDala" in samskrt and
kannaDa? Or is that there were so many sangamas in that area that they
came up with this thumb-of-rule to distinguish between the various
dieties and places?

All answers to questions raised here are welcome.

Regards,
Krishna
