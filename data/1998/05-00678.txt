Acc. to Pokorny, Latin *sermo* is connected with an IE root *suer* =
speaking, etc., which may be a later form of an older IE root *wer* =
speaking.

Pokorny relates *hals* and *sal* to a IE root *sal*

As far as SarasvatI is concerned, *saras-* shows up in Pokorny under IE
*selos* = swamp, sea (with sarasvatI/haraxvati = river name as a
parenthetical remark). Also mentioned under IE *selos* are Gk. *helos* and
Lat. *solum*

Pokorny has another entry for IE *ser* = flowing, running, gushing. Here he
lists Skt. *sisarti* *sarati* *sarayu* etc. and, although with variant
etymologies in a footnote, Gk. *oros* and Lat. *serum*
