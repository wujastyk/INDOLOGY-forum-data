Yes, I remembered some of this from your lecture to UKABS in London last
year.  Actually, it was partly that which led me to think that a new list
was needed.

Actually, I wonder what form the name takes in your inscriptions. As you
know, it is Dhamma-guttaa in the oldest literary source (Diip V 47). The
later accepted form is no doubt influenced by (probably later) stories of
the origin of the school from an eponymous founder: Dharma-gupta - no doubt
mythical.
