That fellow did not participate in the debate; you addressed it to him, and in
doing so characterized him unfairly and probably incorrectly.
"...Some schools of spirituality...?"  Powerful over-analysis of a pretty simple
situation.  What you're describing is called, to use a 'Net expression,
flame-baiting.  It's hardly a deeply significant spiritual or intellectual
pursuit.  What that fellow offered was not flame-bait.  What was offered in the
original post was not flame-bait, either.  It was a callous and chauvinistic
remark, and you were rightly called on it.
I'm sure your original remark was not meant "negatively" or with overt
ideological hostility.  Yet it smacked of both nonetheless.  At best, it was a
carelessly worded question.  Really, you have over-analyzed a pretty simple
situation.  I'm not interested in an on-going e-mail battle with you; I've spent
enough time on this issue as it is.  I think you were wrong in both your initial
remark and your outright and mis-placed hostility when that fellow offered
perfectly valid criticism of your initial remark.  That's pretty simple.
