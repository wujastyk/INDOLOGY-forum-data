Subject: [Admin] WWW and ftp service shutdown for weekend
Message-ID: <161227040935.23782.8501453178122968164.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

The INDOLOGY WWW and ftp services will shut down from about 45 minutes
from now until Monday morning.  This is to permit maintenance of the
mainframe computers on which the INDOLOGY web and ftp services are run.

The listserv discussion, based at Liverpool, should not be affected.

All the best,
Dominik
