samudra
 "S. Kalyanaraman" <kalyan97 at YAHOO.COM>
Any large body of water into which a river empties could potentially
be called "samudra" however, again we have to be specific.
There is evidence of a possible Sarasvati running to the sea, or sea
marshes.  What are the other proposals for the "samudra."
