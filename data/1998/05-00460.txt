South India geography
I am reading a small poem in which a number of south Indian place names
are given. Where are the following places? Could some list member give
corresponding modern names?
1. mahAsurAlaya (in Kerala) - is this Sucindram?
2. anantaSayana (in Kerala) - Travancore?
3. darbhaSayana (in TN) - is this near Ramesvaram?
4. koTTalampAkkam (in TN) - somewhere near Cidambaram - kuRRAlam?
5. pinAkinI (river in TN)
6. payonadI (  -do-  ) - somewhere in Salem-Coimbatore area? The context
mentions the village of Satyamangalam.
Thanks,
Vidyasankar
