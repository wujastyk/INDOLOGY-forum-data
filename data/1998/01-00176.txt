Yiddish translation of Gita (?)

I don't claim to be an expert on Yiddish, but from the language specimens I
have seen, it seems to be about as different from Standard High German as
Dutch. (As do indeed more than one German dialect). Given that it is a
"dying" language, it would make sense to blow some life into it by
translating foreign language literature into it. If languages want to
survive, they have to produce a certain amount of written material. The
remark about the "German patois" was rather insensitive, and, in my opinion,
not very intelligent, so a bit of anger seems rather relevant. Let me remind
you that Hebrew startet out at the beginning of this century even "deader"
than Yiddish is today. Dying languages can be brought back to life.
And by the way, I am not Jewish, and I will be very cross with anybody who
accuses me of being politically correct.
