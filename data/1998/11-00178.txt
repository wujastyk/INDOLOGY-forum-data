My name is Alexandre Sotov; I am a student of St Petersburg State
University, Indo-Arian Dpt. I am glad to join the Indology mailing
list. Since a lack of study materials on Indology is experienced
in St Petersburg I thought of this list to be a help and a kind of
compensation of what I could miss here ;-)
And btw have anyone seen something on Hindi and/or Sanskrit laying
around in the net?
