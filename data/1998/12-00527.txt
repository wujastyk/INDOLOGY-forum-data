Subject: Tiger skin on "Siva's waist
Message-ID: <161227044098.23782.587280185455135433.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear Indology members,

What are the occurences of Tiger skin/fur as
a waist dress for 'Siva Mahadeva?

Does Lord 'Siva wear this, according to Samskrit
texts? What about Sri Rudram, Matsya, Kuurma
and Skanda puraaNams?

Any quotes are highly appreciated.

Have a great 1999, the last year of the century.

With warm regards,
N. Ganesan
