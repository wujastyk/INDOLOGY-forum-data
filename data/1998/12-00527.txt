Tiger skin on "Siva's waist
Dear Indology members,
What are the occurences of Tiger skin/fur as
a waist dress for 'Siva Mahadeva?
Does Lord 'Siva wear this, according to Samskrit
texts? What about Sri Rudram, Matsya, Kuurma
and Skanda puraaNams?
Any quotes are highly appreciated.
Have a great 1999, the last year of the century.
With warm regards,
N. Ganesan
