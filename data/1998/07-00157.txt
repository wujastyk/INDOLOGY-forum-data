I had the feeling that a possible unsophisticated translation
(for a 20th century reader ...)
might be "I love you". I don't think the lover should be
made into a philosopher saying "there is no duality
between you and me!".
So the question is:
are there similar ways of expressing love feelings
 in sanskrit literature?<

There are many Sanskrit love poems in which the feeling 'there is no duality between you and me' is expressed.  I will give you a few examples if you absolutely need them.  Otherwise, let us both save time.
