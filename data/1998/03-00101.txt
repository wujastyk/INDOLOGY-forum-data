Indo-Aryan Invasion (focussed discussion)
I was being a bit hasty. I should have said ``phonology of
late19th-early 20th c. Tamil''. I sometimes get tired of being precise :-)
I think that Zvelebil's fieldwork, published in Acta orientalia
(the one from Hungary) in the laste 50's does. I will have to
check to make sure.
There seems to be an issue of familiarity. I seldom hear/heard people
voice the t of siitaa, but it is often d/tasaradar. It also seems
that voicing of intervocalic stops is much more common than unvoicing
of word initials.
I also suspect that the ubiquity of TV has changed things quite
a bit in the last 15 years. There is also a generational gap here.
Only for the nasal. Of course, you can claim that r is alveolar
too :-)
But you still need a seperate letter since people pronounce it
many different ways, and using any other letter will confuse
everybody.
