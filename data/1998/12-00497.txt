This is open for discussion. There are quite a few philosophers of science
who think science does disprove the existence of God. Wasn't it Laplace who
said 'I don't need this hypothesis'?
And why do you think Nietzsche declared God dead? I know even theologians
who think the belief in the existence of God is outdated.
