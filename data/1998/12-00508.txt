SV: creation of human kind

You seem to use the term "God" to apply to the Christian concept.
Why would there need to be a "place for him."
That's a subjective judgement.  Some people would say that the
complexity of life is not coincidental and is evidence of creative
activity.
Again, a subjective and somewhat emotional judegement.
Here you have the concept of the benevolent God.  It is one thing to
argue whether God is benevolent or not, another to argue whether God
exists or not.
Yet, how many famed works of logic actually argue for divine existence?
I think we need to separate the idea of the Christian concept of "God"
with the general idea of "God."  In Hinduism, God cannot control the law
of karma, yet God is still seen as all-powerful.  Even in Abrahamic
religions, you have the idea of a God *incapable* of doing evil.  Yet,
even here God is still seen as "all-powerful."
