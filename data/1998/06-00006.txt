The most detailed analysis of compound verbal expressions in Hindi is to
be found in a series of articles written by the late Vincenc Porizka,
founder of Hindi studies in Czechoslovakia. See his:
On the Perfective Verbal Aspect in Hindi. In: Archiv Orientalni, vol.
XXXV (1967), pp.64-88, 208-231; XXXVI (1968), pp. 233-251; XXXVII
(1969), pp. 19-47, 345-364.
For a short general overview of his position in interpreting this
complex grammatical phenomenon, see also his:
Hindstina - Hindi Language Course. Cast I. - Part I. Praha 1972 (2nd
ed.), p. 232 and esp. pp. 554-567.
It should be said that Porizka's interpretation is not the only one,
although it is probably the most carefully thought-out, researched and
formulated. His line of interpretation has been continued by his pupil,
now professor, Helmuth Nespital, whose latest contribution (announced in
this list last December) bears the title:
Hindi Kriya-Kosh/ Dictionary of Hindi Verbs
(Subtitle) Containing all Simple and Compound Verbs, their
Lexical Equivalents in English and Illustrations of their Usage
xxviii + 1165 pages. Price: Rs. 1100.00
