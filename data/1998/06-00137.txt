niyoga is a topic in the Vasisthadharmasastra, in a chapter which
looks very old (it has several layers) and which has been preserved in a
rather corrupted form. The oldest parts of the VasDhS
certainly go back to the time of Panini (because Panini refers to
words which occur only there). So the 4th century BC may be possible.
