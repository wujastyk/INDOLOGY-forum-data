This is basically the Jaina view of knowledge: the soul, which _is_ knowledge (in a certain sense; we should of course always be careful when translating such terms) is clouded / covered by karma, and as the soul is purified (i.e., karma is removed) the innate pure knowledge (which is omniscience) manifests itself increasingly.
(This is just one ancient view with which I am familiar. Are there any comparable views, of comparable antiquity?)
