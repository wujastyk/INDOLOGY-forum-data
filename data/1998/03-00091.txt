Indo-Aryan invasion
Prof Bryant
There has never been any bad scholarship.  All work done for Indology was
greatly helpful in preserving the subject.
There are many known portions of the subject, which have been treated
exceedingly well by all scholars traditional or modern (starting from sayana
till date), but many of these scholars did a poor job when they met with
unknowns or forgotten symbols.  Leaving the unknown as unknown would be more
appropriate and leaves a chance for future scholars to develop better
interpretations.
Rewriting the history of IE/PIE/IA/IAD is welcome but we are not looking for
any quick results.
