As far as I can see, retribution is precisely the idea behind Manu's stating
that criminals are purified (absolved) by being punished, and thus a very
basic Hindu (or Brahminical, Lars, if you insist) concept. For a modern
defense of the retributive view, see C.S. Lewis' article "The Humanitarian
Theory of Punishment" (1949). Several good points there.
