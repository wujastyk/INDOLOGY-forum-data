On "Drupada," more or less in line with John Smith's note, see
Madeleine Biardeau, "Etudes de mythologie hindoue: 4, bhakti et avatara,"
Bulletin de l'Ecole Francaise d'Extreme Orient 65 (1978), 241-53, and the
"Compte rendu" of her 1978-79 seminars in the Annuaire de l'Ecole Pratique
des Hautes Etudes, vol. 87:153-55. A peg-leg seems a stretch.
