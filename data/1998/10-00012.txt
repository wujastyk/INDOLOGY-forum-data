What follows is a result of my research on "Aryanization" of Agastya. Since
the material is long, I am splitting it into multiple postings. Comments are
welcome.

----------------------------------------

There is a term "ko/Otukula" which occurs in Tamil inscriptions which give
important clues to the religious and cultural history of South Asia.
Specifically, the early followers of ziva seem to have been potters. It looks
like this term "ko/Otukula" has not been understood by epigraphists or
religious scholars or practising zivAcArya priests till now.

Even the correct form of the word has not been decided on until now. For
instance, G. V. Srinivasa Rao, the editor of some volumes of South Indian
Inscriptions, transliterates a name obviously derived from 'ko/Otukula" as
"kOdukulavan" in Vol. 13  and as "gOdukulavan" in vol. 19. Tamil Lexicon
considers the form to be "kotukula". Allowing for the variations in
transliteration of -t-  as -d- or -t-, one has to decide on the initial
consonant and vowel. The reason for the variation is that most written texts
in Tamil did not distinguish between short e and long E and between short o
and long O.until the time of Beschi. Also, Tamil cannot have voiced stops in
word-initial positions. So the lexicon considered the first vowel to be short
while Rao considered it to be long. Also, Rao seems to have "reconstructed"
the first consonant to be "g" in one case and  taken as "k" in another.

The correct form of the word is obtained from a tirumantiram verse as shown
below.
