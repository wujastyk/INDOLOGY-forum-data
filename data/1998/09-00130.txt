Subject: Best computer for Sanskrit?
Message-ID: <161227041498.23782.12326170677954710743.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Please post your responses to the list--I'm sure I'm not the only person in
this situation.

I'm nursing a six-year-old Macintosh computer that is at the end of its useful
life. I am going to buy a new computer by January, 1999. While the Apple
Computer Corporation certainly seems to be coming back to life, I am undecided
whether to stick with the Mac or switch to Windows.

What do members of this list feel is the best platform for multilingual
computing--esp. Indic languages and, most particularly, Sanskrit?
Who is doing the best job of implementing Unicode?
Which platform has the best Devanagari fonts?
Is WorldScript now a cutting-edge technology, average, or obsolete?

Thank you all for your input. I am looking forward to reading your comments.

Brian
