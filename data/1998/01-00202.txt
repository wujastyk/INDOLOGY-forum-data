The following websites contain information on the "Xinjiang
mummies" (re)discovered by Professor Victor Mair of UPenn.:

I remember reading that someone recently established a homepage
devoted exclusively to the scholarly sources & the fast growing
lore around the Xinjiang mummies, but I can't seem to find the
exact whereabouts of that site. The best starting point for
serious information on the mummies is a special volume of
the Journal of Indo-European Studies (1996) edited by Mair.
Also watch out for the Proceedings of a conference devoted
to the topic (The Bronze Age and Iron Age People of Eastern
Central Asia) soon to be published by Mair and his colleagues.
Cheers, Wolfgang
