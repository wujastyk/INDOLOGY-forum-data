It is however useful to recall that "tam pustakaM darzayati/dadAti" can be
analyzed as possessing three semantic roles.The agent "he" acts upon "a
book" which is an affected object or patient and upon "him" which is the
recipient. On the other hand a current distinction is between the high
transitivity (a book is given or given to see) and the low transitivity
("he" is only secondarily affected by the agent). The point is that
"pustakam darzayati/dadAti" is a complete utterance, whereas"*tam
darzayati/dadAti" is an ellipsed utterance which may be understood
adequately, only if an additional information about the object of high
transitive verb (which information may be recovered from a foregoing
sentence or the general context or the accompanying gestures), is provided.
Thus the two verbs are semantically akin, but their semantic features are
distributed differently depending upon the semantic roles involved.
