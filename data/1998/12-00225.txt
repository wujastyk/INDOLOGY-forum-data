Let me add that the division of the remains of the Buddha was performed by
a brahman named Don.a. And he himself obtains "the vessel" [i.e. kumbha].

MPS 6.25: "Don.o  bra_hman.o  tesam.  sam.gha_nam.  gan.a_nam.
pat.issutva_  Bhagavato  sari_ra_ni  at.t.hadha_  samam.  suvibhattam.
vibhajitva_  te sam.ghe  gan.e  etad  avoca:  'Imam.  me  bhonto  kumbham.
dadantu,  aham.  pi  kumbhassa  thu_pan~  mahan~  ca  karissa_mi_ti'.
Adam.su  kho  te  Don.assa  bra_hman.assa kumbham.".

Translated by T. Rhys Davids as: "...said Don.a the brahmin, in assent to
the assembled brethren. And he divided the remains of the Exalted One
equally into eight parts, with fair division. And he said to them: - 'Give
me, sirs, this vessel, and I will set up over it a sacred cairn, and in its
honour will I establish a feast.' And they gave the vessel to Don.a the
brahmin."

Was the vessel [kumbha] given to Don.a the same with the iron oil trough
[a_yasa_ tela-don.i_], in which the body of the Buddha was placed prior to
its cremation?

Or an urn to which the relics were transferred after cremation and prior to
their division by Don.a? (Thus, it seems, Buddhaghosa; but the text of the
MPS does not say anything on the matter.)
