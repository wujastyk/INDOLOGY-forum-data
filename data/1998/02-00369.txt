This is in fact a very interesting and important topic, which too
few people have looked into. If more Sanskritists would try to
describe how and where Sanskrit was modified in the course of time,
a variety of colleagues would benefit from it: historians, students
of literature, etc. etc. This is of course not easy, but such
research has already been done for, e.g., later Latin, and it
should be possible for Sanskrit too.
