Colleagues,

A Marathi word for Cholera seems to be "mo.dasii".  This was picked up by
the Portuguese in the sixteenth century, and got into circulation in
European sources as "mordisheen" and similar words (including
"mort-de-chien", which seems very apt!).

I've looked in the obvious places (CDIAL, Mayrhofer, various Prakrit and
Pali dicts.), but can find no history for the word.

Can anyone help?

All the best,
Dominik
