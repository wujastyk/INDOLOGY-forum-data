Dear Ms. Storm,
Many years ago, some Muslim students in Jammu gave me a book to read,
called "Jesus in Heaven on Earth". Unfortunately I don't have the exact
reference.
It is a common belief among the mmuslims of pakistan and afganistan (
and also among the Ahmadies living in Israel) that:
1. All Patans and other tribes, are the descendants of the 10 lost
tribes of Israel.
2. jesus, after his resurrection, spent the rest of his life in Kashmir
and the rest of the Northern region.
3. moses, who is called Kaka, also visited kashmir, and they have a
stone there, called "The Kaka Stone", which they believe has some
cnnection to Moses.
How scientific this is, remains to everyone's judjment.
