In 1987 (some 11 years ago) I visited the stupa at Manikyala and found it
in a pretty good state of preservation. Of course I also took some photos
which, if I manage to find them, I could make available to you.
I think - if no serious deterioration has happened in the meantime - a
visit is still rewarding.
