URGENT -- Q. Number of institutions offering courses on Hinduism
Greetings, all,
I write to ask for a tentative number of institutions in English-speaking
countries, except US, Canada, and Nez Zealand, offering introductory and
intermediate level courses on Hinduism and Religious Traditions of India.
Any information that I could get would be of immense help. Thanks.
Regards,
Sushil
