A transgression? (on Tolstoy and ahimsa)
I've been hesitant to thank Yarosslav, George, Jan, et al; for theier
follow-up on my original Transgression question b/c I did not want to put
this most interesting thread to bed.  Nonetheless, else I otherwise seem
ungrateful, please know that I have enjoyed everyone's comments, found
them useful, and hope that any further info continues to come to light.

It is ludicrous to consider language as anything other
than that of which it is the transformation.
