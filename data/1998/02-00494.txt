HTML formatted papers via Indology?
Does anybody know if the Indology-server accepts HTML-messages?
For example to send a paper with HTMLinks in order to facilitate the reading of such papers for all members?
Are the emails restricted absolutely to text-format?
Any members I contact by their personal email-adress receive HTML-emails easily.
