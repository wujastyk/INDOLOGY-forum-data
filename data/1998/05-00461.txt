Brhadaranyaka Upanisad III. ii .12
Is
names?
The upanishad vamSa lists do give a number of patronymics and
matronymics, especially in the BAU and in CU, not to mention the large
number of names given as those who challenge yAjnavalkya. Even the
praSna gives names for the six students who approach pippalAda for
instruction.
