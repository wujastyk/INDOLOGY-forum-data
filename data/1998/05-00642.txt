Zraadha in Nepal
Dear Richard Cohen,
                a belated further comment on Your questions regarding zraadha among
the Shakyas of Nepal. Your questions seem to imply that the Saakyas of
Nepal are related to the clan of Shakyamuni. This is probably a
misconception, though a popular one which can also be found among
Shakyas themselves. It is more likely that they are called Shakyas
because they are the descendents of a class of people who used to be
called Shakya-Bhiksus, i.e. Bhikshus in the order of Shakyamuni. Unlike
the Vajracaryas, these Shakya-Bhiksus did not take the further step of
becoming tantric masters (vajracaryas), but like them they did become
grihasthas.
Hope this helps, Alexander Rospatt
