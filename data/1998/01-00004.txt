Subject: periya tirumozi and irregular forms - tA, taru, and tar
Message-ID: <161227034565.23782.15600702273295275222.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

In Dravidian, the hypothetical roots of tA, and vA are construed to be tar and
var respectively by some linguists. I have come across an instance in the
edition of nAlAyirattivviyappirapantam I have (periya tirumozi 1. 8) where we
find the form "tiritarvEn2" instead of "tiritaruvEn2". I do not know if this
is simply a printing error or indeed the correct reading of the poem. Can
anybody check their editions and tell me what the correct reading of this poem
is? Thanks in advance.

If this form tarvEn2 is found to be correct, then this is an important
finding.
