Om <--> Amen
*Also in early Upanisads "Om" means just "yes," equivalent to
*"tathaa." Is it possible that it could have first just been an
*affirmative  particle that later gained its cosmic signifcance
*and was not fabricated from the vowel tables of the Sanskrit
*alphabet?
  Please see the important publication establishing
  'Om' to be of Dravidian origin:
Parpola, Asko, 1981. On the primary meaning and etymology of the
sacred syllable ?m. Pp. 195-213 in: Asko Parpola (ed.), Proceedings
of the Nordic South Asia Conference held in Helsinki, June 10-12,
1980. (Studia Orientalia, 50). Helsinki: The Finnish Oriental Society.
Summary of the main theses:
Original meaning: Om in the Vedic ritual = 'yes', om = tath? = 'yes'
also in ordinary conversation, and in the Chandogya Upanishad ?m is
expressly said to be a word expressing agreement.
Etymology: < Dravidian ?m < ?kum 'yes' < 'it is (fitting, suitable)',
? labialized by the following m as Jaffna Tamil ?m < ?m.
