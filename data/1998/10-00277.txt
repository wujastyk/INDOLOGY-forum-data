>(Pit-Grave or "Kurgan") culture c. 3500 BC out of the Khvalynsk and

>Cases have been made for early expansions eastwards
>(proto-Tocharians?) and westwards into the Balkan peninsula.
>The history and origin of the Tocharians (which we find in Chinese
>Turkestan in the first centuries AD speaking an IE language not

>on archaeological similarities between Afansievo and the more western
>steppe cultures Sredny Stog/Khvalynsk and its 5th mill. predecessors
>(Dnepr-Donets culture, Samara culture).

>The situation in the Balkans is also obscure.  The "Old European"
>civilization (Karanovo, Starc^evo, Vinc^a) which had flourished there
>from the 7th millennium to c. 4200 BC was suddenly interrupted.  In
>the so-called "Balkan dark ages" (c. 4200-3200 BC) most of the tells
>were abandoned (but in Romania and the Western Ukraine, the "Old

>Turning to the east again, the origin of Indo-Iranian can also be
