A question about the term "Iyer"
I would like to know as to what is the approx time period since which
the word "aiyar" has been used to refer to a Tamil speaking Smartha
Brahmin.
  Earlier discussions by S.Palaniappan have been helpful in giving us
the etymology of "ai" related words and have proved that the word does
go back to classical Tamil..but since when has the word been
specifically used to denote a Smartha Brahmin? Likewise, does Tamil
literature ever use terms like "aiyAL" to refer to a smArta woman?
  All replies will be appreciated.
Regards,
Krishna
