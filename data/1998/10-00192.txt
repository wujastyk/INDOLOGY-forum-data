Does anyone kow what the river Kabul and the ter-
rain near and around the city of Kabul look like?
A reason for asking this question is that there
are in Europe place- and rivernames similar to
Kabul. See Hans Bahlow: Deutschlands geograph-
ische Namenwelt, Frankfurt am Main, 1965: Kabel,
in 839 'Cavila' and Kobel, in 890 'silva Cobolo'.
Acc. to Bahlow these names are "Bezeichnungen fuer
Wasser, Sumpf" and suffixes -ul, -ol mean "swamp".
In southern Sweden near the Baltic there is a pla-
ce called Kabusa at a swampy/dirty creek also cal-
led Kabusa. Acc. to a heretic but plausible etymo-
logy Kabusa equals Kab- "dirty" and -usa "water".
Cfr European rivers: the Usa in Germany, the Ouse,
780 Usa, in England and the Ousse in France. The
Oxford Concise Dict-y of Engl. Placenames, 1936,
Ouse, has: "A Brit rivername from the root ved-,
ud- 'water', found in Sanskrit udan- 'water', udra
'a water animal' Engl. otter, OIr usce 'water' &c."
If the characteristics of the river and/or place
Kabul do fit Bahlow's definitions could not that
name be an "Ur-Aryan" combined water-/place-name
referring to swamp/'dirty' water analogous with
such old names in Europe, acc. to Balow. RSVP
