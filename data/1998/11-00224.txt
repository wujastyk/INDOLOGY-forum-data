I don't think any Sanskrit plays have been staged in this country in a regular theatre, but Kalidasa's Shakuntala was staged and performed by the Norwegian Radio Theatre (thus reaching the entire population in principle). It was translated by one of our most brilliant literary translators, Mr. Rytter,  into New Norwegian (the man even knew Sanskrit!), and the result was complete magic. Often, Sanskrit literature is massacred by the horrible philological translations that are necessary for scholars, but should not be given to anyone outside a university. Mr. Rytter's translation made Shakuntala sound as wonderful in Norwegian as it does in Sanskrit.
