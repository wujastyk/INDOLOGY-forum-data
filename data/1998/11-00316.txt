SV: Neo-Sanskrit
Here is the daily prayer recited at the branches of RSS.  It was composed
by Pt. N.N. Bhide who was, by the way, the highschool Sanskrit teacher for
me and for Ashok Aklujkar:
        namas te sadA vatsale mAtRbhUme
        tvayA hindubhUme sukhaM vardhito 'ham |
        mahAmangale puNyabhUme tvad-arthe
        patatv eSa kAyo namas te namas te ||
        prabho xaktiman hindurASTrAngabhUtA
        ime sAdaraM tvAM namAmo vayam |
        tvadIyAya kAryAya baddhA kaTIyam
        zubhAm AziSaM dehi tatpUrtaye ||
        ayayyAM ca vizvasya dehIza xaktim

        vijetrI ca naH saMhatA kAryazaktir
        vidhAyAsya dharmasya saMrakSaNaM |
        paraM vaibhavaM netum etat svarASTram
        samarthA bhavatv AziSA te bhRzaM ||
        This was composed by Pt. Bhide in Nagpur at the request of Dr.
Hedgewar, the founder of the RSS.
        The vocabulary is very significant in its new Hindutva semantics.
Not only do the words hindubhUmi and hindurASTra appear here as new
coinages, the new meanings of the words rAStra "nation", dharma "Hindu
religion", and vIravrata "vow of heroism" are significant.  This poem has
become the anthem for RSS.
