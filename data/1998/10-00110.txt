SV: Oguibenine's book

It is my pleasure to inform you that the book of Prof. B. Oguibenine, of
which the English version has been recently announced by Dominik, had
also been published in Italian (Pisa: Giardini, 1985).
Judging from my own copy of the book, the Italian edition is in French, not in Italian. ("Essais sur la culture vedique et indo-europeenne").
Best regards,
