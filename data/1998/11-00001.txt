Well, I don't think Igor' Mixajlovich is denying that.  He is merely
asserting that this vocabulary layer embedded in Mitanni Hurrian was
quite possibly fossilized, and that it was no longer in living use by
the time the Mitanni state was established c. 1500.  He might also be
denying that the vocabulary is specifically (Proto-)Indo-Aryan, but
that it should rather be regarded as Proto-Indo-Iranian.  That at
least is my own preferred interpretation, if only because it would
considerably simplify the picture of Indo-Iranian movements up to the
2nd millennium.  (I might add here that T. Gamq'relidze and V.V.
Ivanov, in "Indoevropejskij jazyk i indoevropejcy", reach the rather
surprising conclusion that the "Mitanni Aryan" dialect is closer to
Iranian than to Indo-Aryan).
Quite so.  But this isn't always the case.  The Visigothic rulers of
Spain were still called Wamba, Witiza and Roderick (Rodrigo), long
after the Gothic language was quite forgotten.  And the Catalan names
for "fox" (<guineu> and <guilla>) derive from two countesses called
Winidhild and Wisila, whose mother tongue certainly wasn't Frankish.
And there are still an awful lot of Russians called Oleg, Ol'ga or
Igor'...
Mari is (Indo-)Iranian without doubt.  I reserve judgment on the
Ingush word (Is it just Ingush or Chechen / Dagestanian as well?
Does *mari- occur in Scytho-Ossetic?).  I frankly prefer the
Indo-Iranians going round the other side of the Caspian, from the
Volga/Urals through the Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan steppe (where we
have the Proto-(Indo-)Iranian Andronovo culture in the 2nd and
attested East Iranians in the 1st millennium) and making contact with
the outposts of Near Eastern and Harappan cultures just south of the
Amu Darya river maybe as early as 3000 BC.  I can't exclude the
Caucasus route, of course, but I think it rather less likely (and
gorazdo goristee -- rather more mountainous).
