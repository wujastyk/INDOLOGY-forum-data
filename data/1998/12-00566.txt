Early Giithaa sculptures
<<< [...]
 Govardhanadhara KRSNa theme is popular in sculpture of 4th-6th
AD (see V.P.Dwivedi. Mbh in Indian art. - In: Mahabharata: Myth and
reality.
Differing Views. Delhi, 1976, pp. 126-134). Is not the bhakti cult of
VAsudeva
evidenced in the same 2th century BC by the famous "Heliodoros" column?
Is not
the theism of the GItA firmly rooted both in theistic tendencies of
early
SAMkhya-Yoga and in theistic UpaniSads?
   I heard that there is a difference between Vasudeva Krishna
   and Gopala (Giridhara) Krishna cults.
   Can someone explain this difference, please?

Participants of this discussion are
probably right asserting that MASS bhakti cult of the Middle ages could
develop under some Buddhist or foreign influences. But this is not the
case
with GItA's theism and bhakti.
   After the 1962 paper of Charlotte Vaudeville, many important
   progresses in bhakti studies have been made.
   Pl. see A. K. Ramanujan's Speaking of Siva, Hymns for
   the drowning, F. Hardy's virahabhakti, Vidya Dehejia's
   Path of the Tamil saints, Indira Peterson's Poems for 'Siva,
   V. Narayanrao's, Warriors of 'Siva, ....
   Hindu bhakti does not have any foreign origin.
   Sufism has nothing to do with bhakti origins.
   Bhakti-like phenomenon can be seen in the development
   of Bodhsattva bhakti in Buddhism and similar ones in
   Jainism earlier. Later, Hindu MASS bhakti starts in the Tamil
   South in 5th century AD and spreads northward.
