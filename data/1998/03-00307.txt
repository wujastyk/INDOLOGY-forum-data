Indo-Aryan Invasion (focussed discussion)
Vidyanath Rao wrote (in response to earlier postings):
Just to make the record straight, the results of Prof. K. Zvelebil's
fieldwork were not published in Acta orientalia but in Archiv orientalni
(the one from Prague - we are no longer part of Austro-Hungarian Empire ;-]),
abbreviated ArOr, or even ArO which may be a bit misleading...
Perhaps the following references may be relevant:
- Dialects of Tamil - I: Introduction and Texts, ArOr 27(1959), 272-317;
- (with S. Viswanathan), Dialects of Tamil II - Texts (Madras and Madras
Brahmin), ArOr 27 (1959), 572-603;
- Dialects of Tamil II (Appendix), ArOr 28 (1960), 220-224;
- Dialects of Tamil III (Madurai), ArOr 28 (1960), 414-456;
- Dialects of Tamil IV - Erode, Tutucorin, Ramnad, ArOr 31 (1963), 535-668;
- Spoken Language of Tamilnad, ArOr 32 (1964), 237-264
(being naturally just a fraction of the author's vast work on the subject).
