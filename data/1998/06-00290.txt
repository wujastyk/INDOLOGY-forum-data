Grantha characters
I believe Grantha chracters or GranthAkSaram is the script used in 
Tamil Nadu to write sanskrit works. They have to use a different
script because the tamil with a single letter for the first four 
letters of each varga (absence of some other letters also) is inadequate 
to transliterate sanskrit works.
