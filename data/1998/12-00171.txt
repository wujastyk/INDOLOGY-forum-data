Abstract of the paper: * The Peasant Women's Movement in the
Philippines: Alternative Perspectives on Development* by Ligaya
Lindio-McGovern

This paper examines the alternative views on development that the
peasant women's movement in the Philippines is forging. The main focus
is on AMIHAN, the National Federation of Peasant Women in the
Philippines, and one of its local chapters in Mindoro, KAMMI
(Kababaihang Magbubukid ng Mindoro, translated as Peasant Women of
Mindoro).[1] It is appropriate to focus on AMIHAN for two reasons: (1)
it is the national non-governmental organization that leads the peasant
women's movement in the Philippines, and (2) it advocates for
development policies that offer alternatives to what are currently
legitimized by the Philippine government.
Lindio-McGovern gathered the data presented in this paper during her
fieldwork in the Philippines in the Summers of 1989 and 1996. She
interviewed a total of 39 Filipino peasant women: 35 were members of
KAMMI and four were national leaders of AMIHAN. She also participated
in, observed, and took down field notes about their activities, as well
as gathered and content analyzed their organizational documents. To have
a direct experience of the village life of the peasant women of KAMMI,
she stayed in Mindoro and visited the villages of some of the peasant
women. She did most of the interviews and observations during the 1989
fieldwork. In 1996 she went back to the Philippines in order to observe
first hand new developments there.

AMIHAN was formally launched in 1986 to organize peasant women on the
national level and to advocate for agrarian reforms that will respond to
the particular situation of peasant women. In this paper, the Author
will focus on the following themes in AMIHAN's views on development: a)
peasant women and land reform, b) peasant women, usury and control of
traders, c) peasant women, foreign debt, the International Monetary
Fund, and GATT (General Agreement on Tariff and Trade), and d)
empowerment not integration into an exploitative nature of Philippine
development.[2]
