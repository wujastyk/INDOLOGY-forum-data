"Curry" and its origins?
Food for thought:
As regards the question, in general, of what "curry" implies in indigenous
and English use: it caught my eye that E. Hultzsch, and others following
him, translated suupa- in Asokan rock edict 1 as "curry."  This word
occurs in
the context of Asoka's concerns about the number of animals (including
"peacock' [moraa] and "deer" [mago]) being killed for food (suupaathaaya),
so evidently
suupa- refers to meat dishes.  Does this term then perhaps correspond to
Kannada kaRi,
etc? (and was Hultzsch, who I think knew Kannada, consciously thinking of
this in his translation?).
[The terms are quoted according to the Girnar version of RE I; others are
similar.]
