Well, there are different textual sources that give cultural
descriptions of the Scythians and Hsiung-nu, for example.  Herodotus
tells us a lot about the Scythians.  Information on the Hsiung-nu comes
from various Chinese sources including the official imperial histories.
Hippocrates uses the Scythians as an example of how the human body is
affected by extreme cold temperatures.  He explains the short stocky
build, lack of facial hair and "humidity" or lack of definition of
facial features as a result of the effect of climate.
Wait a minute, Manu commands pouring molten lead into the ears of Sudras
who dared listen to the Vedas!
