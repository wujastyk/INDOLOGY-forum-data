KaaraNDavyUha
In KaaraNDavyUhasUtra, is the word Potalaka as the
residence of Avalokitezvara mentioned?
Does SimhaladvIpa occur in KaaraNDavyUha?
Does dakSiNApatha come there & Avalokita
travels from there by vimAna to Jetavana
near Benaras?
 If SimhaladvIpa occurs, I wonder are there
any mahAyAna texts that mention SimhaladvIpa?
Are there any Western language studies on
KaaraNDavyUha?
Thanks,
N. Ganesan
