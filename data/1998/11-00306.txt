Pune also has a tradition of staging Sanskrit translations of Shakespeare's
dramas.  Professor S.D. Joshi's Sanskrit translation of Hamlet was staged
in Pune around 1980.  

I have once seen a short story by Tolstoy translated into Sanskrit. It would be interesting to know to what extent European literary works have been translated into that language, and if these editions are available. 

Anyone out there who knows more?

Best regards,
