Om mani padme hum (was: Karandavyuha)
See David L. Snellgrove, Indo-Tibetan Buddhism, London 1987, p. 195, where
he quotes the spell "OM MANIPADME HUM = O thou with the jewelled lotus"
adding a footnote (no. 134): "These "spells" (vidyA) are all feminine in
form, which is entirely normal, and the oft seen translation of "Jewel in
the Lotus" is a later misunderstanding of someone who is unaware of the
nature of such "spells" and the whole feminine context of their
application."
