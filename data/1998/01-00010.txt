Tantra texts/Woodroffe
A friend interested in the Mahanirvanatantra just asked me:
        (a) whether the translation by Sir John Woodroffe, alias Arthur
Avalon, is acceptable by academic standards; and
        (b) whether any other useful English translations exist.
I regret to say that I could not answer either question. Could anyone on the
list help?
Thanks in advance,
