Subject: Sanskrit primers in Hindi?
Message-ID: <161227044041.23782.14289648130580072521.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear list members,

Christmas Eve is probably not a very good time to post a question, but I'll
give it a shot: an Indian friend wishing to learn Sanskrit asked me about
good primers and dictionaries, primarily in Hindi. Being Hindi-illiterate
myself, I am wholly ignorant on this subject. Can anyone recommend any
particular introductory texts and dictionaries for Hindi-speakers trying to
learn Sanskrit on their own?

Thanks in advance,
Martin Gansten
