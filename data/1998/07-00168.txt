Kolam article
My article in Tamil with the title, "viruntu uNNa varuka"
(Come, enjoy the feast!) appears in vol. 2, Kolam, Mirror of Tamil culture,
e-journal from IITS. (www.uni-koeln.de/phil-fak/indologie/kolam/...)
This gives an overview of food in Tamil literature from the beginnings.
To read Kolam, two fonts (IITS and Mylai-Sri) need to be in the system.

Personal note: Wrote this paper when my family was visiting India
and I was really longing for Indian food  :-)
