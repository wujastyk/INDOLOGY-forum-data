Sorry if this is obvious but I don't understand this. Why two direct objects?

If you took as the basic analysis 'he makes/causes [Rama to see the book]'
where the whole clause 'Rama sees the book' would be the direct object and Rama
the subject of that clause, where would there be two direct objects?

(Or, to stay closer to the Sanskrit, something like 'he CAUSATIVE [Rama
sees the book]'
becoming 'he makes-see [Rama -- the book]')
