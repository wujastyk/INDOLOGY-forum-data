Software for scanning of Indian rarities?
It is possible. I do not know where to buy, but
you can adjust any of the programs like
OPLIMIT/RECOGNITA/OCRTRACE to read devanagari
manuscripts. You have to open the file where the
bits are fixed at certain positions and harmonise
it with devanagari-letters. If any of these
programs provides the model as FON or TTF or PFB
file, it will be easy. Some knowledge of
programming would be helpful.
