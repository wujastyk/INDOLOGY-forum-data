In Tamil Nadu, there are many different kinds of 'pancakes'.
As already mentioned tOcai (pronounced as dOsai) and appam are
used. Other examples are 'aDai' and 'aappam'.
In tOcai itself, there are many different kinds, made of  rice, wheat,
red-rice, kuccikkizaGku, ravai, maida etc.
Similarly there are many varieties in appam, aappam, adai. A rough
estimate may be some 25-30 varieties
