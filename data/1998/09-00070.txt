Dear Dominique,

I tried this web site, and even with a slow connection it took only 50
seconds to bring up the home page. I think this is reasonable for such nice
picture.

However, if you cannot tolerate this you should just choose INTERNET options
in your web browser and turn off "show Pictures." then this home page loads
in about one second.

I also get irritated by web site that take along time to load, however, your
language is much more offensive than waiting for a nice picture!!!

By the way, Bill Gates has absolutely nothing to do with how a person
creates their web site. And Microsoft was actually a rather late comer into
the INTERNET market, which had already developed its tradition of creating
slow web site.
