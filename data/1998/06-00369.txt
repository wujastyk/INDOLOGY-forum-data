REtroflex sounds
Lars Martin Fosse wrote
Why do people always mix up the islands Sardinia and Sicily? Because of the
greater television impact of the latter? Sardinian (sa limba sarda) and Pugliese
were the retroflexe candidates.
And as regards Sardinian, maybe the double .d.d is indeed allophonic, but
the .n.dh combination is not.
