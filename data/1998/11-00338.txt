reminded of our discussion about Indian inspiration in Western music,
I find it somewhat embarrassing to have to confess, that I recently
found some additional information in my own bookshelf. The book India
and Italy, edited by R.M.Cimino and F. Scialpi (Rome 1974), has a
small chapter (p. 180-182) on this theme. Here we learn that F.
Alfano (1876-1954) published also a revised version of his ZakuntalA
in 1944/45. Illustration 77 of the book gives the first page of
Alfano's manuscript, "lento e misterioso". Several Italian composers,
such as Alfano, Alfredo Casella, Ottorino Respighi et al. also
used Tagore's poems to compose songs.


I don't know it this has been mentioned, but Holst wrote a three-act opera called Sita before he wrote his Savitri. It was very much imbued with the Wagnerian spirit and on the grandest scale. Sita (1900-1906) won third prize in the Ricordi competition, but was never performed. Holst later abandoned the Wagnerian style, which may be one of the reasons why Sita was never performed.
