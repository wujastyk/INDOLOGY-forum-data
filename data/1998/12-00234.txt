thuggees?

A closer look reveals that MacMunn does indeed deal with "The Appalling
Story of Thuggism" (p.211-18 in the chapter "Darkest India").   This
section just isn't referred to in the index.
The writers on Thuggee mentioned by MacMunn include
Dr Sherwood, in the _Literary Journal_ of Madras, 1816;
Meadows Taylor, _Confessions of a Thug_;
B. A. Stewart (a note in the above book?)
Captain (Col.) Sleeman;
