'Siva and Avalokitezvara
Due probably to my growing senility I forgot to mention:
Rolf Stein, Avalokitezvara/Kouan-yin, un example de transformation d'un
dieu en deesse, in Cahiers d'Extreme-Asie 2 (1986): 17-80 [with English
summary]. As one would expect, Stein's paper is exhaustive and detailed, --
and reliable!
