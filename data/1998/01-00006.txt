Help with a sentence?

<<In a textbook I found the sentence:
``kah khalu pati-patnyoor madhyee yad vrttam tat sarvam jaanaati?
svasya maataa-pitroor api sarvam caritram jJaatum na zakyam''
and I don't know what to make of ``svasya''. I wanna translate
``who indeed knows all that which went on between husband and
wife? the whole life of one's father and mother even it is
impossible to know''... but for that I should have expected
``svayoor maataa-pitroor api''. Can you help? Thanks. And Happy
New Year to all.>>
	I would suggest the following: maataa-pitror is here parallel to pati-
patnyor, with madhye yad
 to be understood in the second line. Thus svasya
means "one's", i.e. it is not possible to know all the dealings even (api) in
the midst of ONE'S father and mother."
	And of course, happy new year.
