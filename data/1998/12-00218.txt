A remark on Georg v. Simson posting and a question in connection with pots.
Dro.na/dro.n_i might have lost its original connection with 'wood' quite
early.
Despite CDIAL 6641, where Pali don.i_ is explained as "wooden trough" -
don.i_ seems to denote rather a certain type of vessels ("trough, vat,
tub"). [Cf. The PTS Pali-English Dictionary, p. 331, where don.i_ "a
(wooden) trough...]
In order to be more specific about material out of which the don.i_ type
vessels were made, one had then - at least in some cases - to resort to the
use of attributive adjectives.
One such case is when tela-don.i_ is attributed by a_yasa_, making it of
course not "iron wooden oil trough" but simply "iron oil trough".
It might be of possible interest that in the Mahaparinibbana-sutta [5.11;
Sacred Books of the Buddhists,  Vol. III, Pali Text Society 1995, pp.
155-156] don.i_ is mentioned in connection with death:
"Then they place the body in an oil vessel of iron [ayasa_ya
tela-don.iya_], and cover that close up [pat.ikujjitva_] with another oil
vessel of iron. They then build a funeral pyre..., and burn [jha_penti] the
body of the king of kings..."
[In the footnote to ayasa_ya tela-don.iya_ the translator (T. Rhys Davids)
says: "Ayas was originally used for bronze, and only later for iron also,
and at last exclusively for iron. As kam.sa is already a common word for
bronze in very early Buddhist Pali texts, I think a_yasa (not ayasa) would
here mean 'of iron'..." And he goes on: "The whole process as described is
not very intelligible; and one might suppose that ayasa after all had
nothing to do with any metal, and was a technical term descriptive of some
particular size or shape or colour of oil vessel. But it is frequently
found in the MSS. when iron is clearly meant."]
Body [s'ari_ra], (closed) vessel, and oil seem to form a triad. Or tetrad -
if we add heat.
Could it be equivalent to the triad: foetus [garbha]/(closed) vessel/(warm)
liquid?
