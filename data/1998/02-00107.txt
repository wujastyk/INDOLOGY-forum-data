Saying that all these words are from Tamil only may not be correct.
For example Koel can be from telugu "koyila". Telugu word is much
closer than "kuyil". Similarly
English       Telugu
copra         kobbari
teak          tEku
coolie        kulI
anicut        Anakatta
cash            kAcu
What I see from the postings on this list from my tamil friends is
that they forget that there are three MAJOR, well developed
dravidian languages besides tamil in South India. Telugu at that time
known as "Gentoo" was extensively used by European and East India
company people. The borrowings cannot be only from tamil will be
a more reasonable position. But then.....
