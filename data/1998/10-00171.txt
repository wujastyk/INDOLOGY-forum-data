Kabul - vijtAzva - svayambhU
I have two questions:
1) What is the etymology of the name of Kabul (Afghanistan) ? Is it
Iranian, or might it be Indo-Aryan ?
2) Does anybody know of a son or successor to
 a) vijitAzva, son of king pRthu vainya (Padma P. e.a.);
 b) the teacher svayambhU (MahAbhArata).
