I'm no expert on this, but I remember reading somewhere that the
vijayanagara kings are  supposed to have used a few portuguese
musketeers in order to quell  rivals. This event would be roughly in
the first decade of the 16th century, since Vasco Da Gama, the first
westerner to find the sea route to India came there in 1498...So,
there were muskets in India by the early 16th century

 hoping to help
