some op/old books on India & British India
        I have only 1MB of space to store my mail. I appreciate the book
lists, however, if receive them with other large files from other lists,
then I run the risk of my box filling up, not receiving other mail, being
shunted off those lists and having to figure out which lists I have to
resubscribe to.
        So, yes, URLs are a good idea!
