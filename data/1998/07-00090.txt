I fail to understand. As far as I can see, the verb "fill" can be used in
different ways, see examples in Webster's Dictionary: 1. "to fill a jar
with water"; 5. "to fill sand into a pail". And I doubt that this double
use of the verb is recent, because you have the same in German: "einen Krug
mit Wasser fuellen" and "Sand in einen Kuebel fuellen". The same holds god
for the Norwegian verb "fylle".
