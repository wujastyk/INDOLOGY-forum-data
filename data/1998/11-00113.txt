I think this type of back and forth argument illustrates the problems
with trying to determine language relationships based on a few words
in historical sources.  A lot of it is subjective and based on materials
that may be highly corrupt.

For example, in Europe Timur Leng was corrupted to Tamerlane for some
time.  If someone were to come across the ashes of modern civiliztion
and analyze this name he might surmise that it as a compound of English
"tamer" and "lane," and thus: "way of the lion tamer!"
