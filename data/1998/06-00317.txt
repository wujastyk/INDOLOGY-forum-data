I forgot to mention that

(A)  Southworth (1979: 201) has parallel development of *rt > .t  in
Drav. and IA;

see: Lexical evidence for early contacts between Indo-Aryan and Dravidian.
In: M. Deshpande and P.E.  Hook. (eds.). Aryan and Non-Aryan in India. Ann

(B)  Hamp, Eric P. On the Indo-European Origins of Retroflexes in
Sanskrit. JAOS 116, 1996, 719-723,

wants to find a purely inner-Aryan development, quite similar to Prof.
Krishnamurti's scenario.

This is of course entirely correct and one of the staple arguments for
INNOVATION in Vedic Sanskrit after the split of Iranian/Vedic ~ Old
Indo_Aryan; similar cases in nom. rAT 'chieftain' < *rAc'-s < IE
*(h)rEg'-s, (Latin rex) etc. ---

Indigenists, I imagine, would counter-argue that (Rg)Vedic innovated here
AFTER the Iranians, IEs had left the Panjab, which puts this emigration
and sound change change (depending on your RV,4000 -8000 BC!) well into
the stone age period, when even the word for dog/wolf were hardly
differentiated and when they had no copper, pottery, not to speak about
horses and chariots....  or at least into the pre-Harappan period, in the
early 3rd mill. when equally, there were no horses, spoked-wheeled
chariots, little copper in N. India. etc. etc.

Something does not fit, it seems...


(NB someone some weeks ago mentioned the Siwalik type horse... That,
unfortunately, belongs entirely to the realm of palaeo-zoology. Long gone
before the Indus period, just as the palaeo-horse in the Anericas...)
