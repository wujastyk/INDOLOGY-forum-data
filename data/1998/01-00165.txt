Yiddish translation of Gita (?)
Yiddish is a literary language in which thousands of books have been
written. It has a long history in Europe, where it was the primary language
of millions of people before the Nazi Holocaust. The Yiddish translation of
the Bhagavad Gita cited by Francois Obrist was published in 1955 in New
York. I can well imagine that there would have been many educated Jewish
intellectuals in New York at that time who would have been interested in
reading such a famous Indian religious work in the language with which they
were most familiar.
Under certain definitions, Yiddish can be considered a patois. But looked
at from another angle, it is a full blown literary language in its own right.
