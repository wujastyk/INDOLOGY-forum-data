To Dr. Ashok Aklujkar
Dear Ashok,
Thank you for the information. My idea is not so much of stylistic and
other studies as of concepts. An instance in this regard is that of the
Yoga dictionary published by Kaivalya Dham, Lonavla, besides the one of
Sanskrit grammar already mentioned in my first posting.
Best wishes.
KSA
