Again the so-called "Scythian" culture was found among many peoples
including Altaic and Uralic.  In fact, we have much more hard evidence
of this culture among the latter peoples.  I might add that until fairly
recently the Scythian cultures were also considered "Turanian."

I using terms like "impossible" is not useful in the type of speculation
that is being engaged in with these theories.
