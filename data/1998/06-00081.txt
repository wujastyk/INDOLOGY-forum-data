What citations/titles/authors are you referring to here?  Is there
anything online?  Methodological models of what you're discussing is an
excellent idea.  Having waded into the complex issues you address quite
succinctly viz. stats. and indology in your dissertation, I am very
curious to see these works to which your expertise would refer us.
