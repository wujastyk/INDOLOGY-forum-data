The Cat

The Pancatantra tradition knows a story of a deceitful cat. It is
acting like a sadhu and so it deceives the other animals. But its
only intention is -- of course -- to eat them. The popular
edition of the Pancatantra I have at home gives this story in the
third book. I am not sure if it is already in the Tantrakhyayika.
If I am not totally wrong, you will find, at least, a similar
story in the Pali Jatakas; look into the PTSD, sub voce bi.laara.
All the best
