Dear Indologists,

Can anyone direct me to *any* discussion of the traditional style used by
commentators ( i.e., the literary style employed by the writers of
bhaashya, Tiikaa, TippaNii etc.).

I would be looking for:

        articles (e.g. something like Staal's "Scientific Sanskrit"),

        books  (perhaps introductions to academic presentations of such and
such a commentary),

        or traditional (Indian) analyses of the components of the
commentarial style.

merci d'avance,

Adrian Burton
