literature on commentarial style
Dear Indologists,
Can anyone direct me to *any* discussion of the traditional style used by
commentators ( i.e., the literary style employed by the writers of
bhaashya, Tiikaa, TippaNii etc.).
I would be looking for:
        articles (e.g. something like Staal's "Scientific Sanskrit"),
        books  (perhaps introductions to academic presentations of such and
such a commentary),
        or traditional (Indian) analyses of the components of the
commentarial style.
merci d'avance,
Adrian Burton
