However, even in the RV  Vasistha's culture does not seem particularly
IE.  The RV (II 5-3-7) states that the priests of the Saudasas were Angirasas,
and Vasistha was the priest of Sudas.

Well, according to tradition, Krishna Dvaipayana compiled both at the
same time.  Also, the Puranas are at least attempts at historical
writing.  One can't say the same thing about the Vedas.

The practice used in most other cases.  Why make exceptions here?

I would strongly disagree with this statement, but the argument
against it could get long and complicated.

Wrong.  The onus is on you to prove IE identification. Since we are
talking mainly about language, I would love to hear of something more
than a horse burial which was very common among *non-IE* peoples.
