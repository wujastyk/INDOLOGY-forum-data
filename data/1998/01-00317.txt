Paramparaa
Would someone be able to inform something about Ramezvara Jha and Zrii Gopaala Zaastrii ( Darzana Kezvarii). Both were active in Varanasi during the 70's, the first coming from Kashmir to teach Kashmirian Shivaism and smoTa theory ; the other,  20 years older and  his disciple, taught strictly PaaNinian grammar with no concessions to whatever Kaumudi. He considered the krama fundamental for the esoteric side of the Ashtadhyayii. I would be glad to know something of their paramparaa.
