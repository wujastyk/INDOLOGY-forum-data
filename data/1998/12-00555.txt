Subject: ghaTikA as college
Message-ID: <161227044182.23782.16311607569801501731.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I would appreciate if anybody can give me information/references about the
early uses of the word "ghaTikA" in the sense of "college" in
Sanskrit/Prakrit/Pali. (I know about the Kadamba inscription referring to the
ghaTikA in Kanchi.) Thanks in advance.
