SV: SV: On logic and fuzziness

Definition of distance is precise and well known.
        d(x,z) <= d(x,y) + d(y,z)
It means simply that if I take a detour (to go to z from x) via y then
the
sum of the two distances which comprise the detour (i.e. d(x,y)+d(y,z))
must be greater than or equal to the direct distance d(x,z). Any kind
of a function that satisfies this can be called a distance metric.
IT is easy to create phonological distances this way. What is lacking
is semantic distance.
If the concept of distance is used (which cannot be used now because the
semantic
distance is missing) all the powerful tools of math, analysis,
probability theory,
correlation-regression analysis, fuzzyl-logic, differential equations
etc
become available.
1. Are there any lists in which these people congregate? I would like to
join and
even invite them to building this semantic space even if only for the
Swadesh-100
list to test the ideas.
2. If there are people interested in building up this semantic distance
metric
I think they should join language at csam.montclair.edu by sending email to
majordomo at csam.montclair.edu and it can be discussed in detail there.
Economists are forced to deal with real world data from different
countries from
different time periods and different soci-economic systems and they have
developed
all sorts of mathematical tools to deal with all problems that crop up.
Linguists
have the same problem. They deal with data from different time periods,
from
different languages with different syntax, and different lexicons.
Best Regards,
Mark
