This requires some kind of a committee and which could/should start with
a small
number of words (like the Swadesh list) and then build bottom up.

Definition of distance is precise and well known.

        d(x,z) <= d(x,y) + d(y,z)

It means simply that if I take a detour (to go to z from x) via y then
the
sum of the two distances which comprise the detour (i.e. d(x,y)+d(y,z))
must be greater than or equal to the direct distance d(x,z). Any kind
of a function that satisfies this can be called a distance metric.

IT is easy to create phonological distances this way. What is lacking
is semantic distance.

You see, it is so terribly difficult to experiment with the past. (Not counting Thor Heyerdahl, who has proved beyond a shadow of doubt that people in the old days could sail anywhere in a shoebox).

If the concept of distance is used (which cannot be used now because the
semantic
distance is missing) all the powerful tools of math, analysis,
probability theory,
correlation-regression analysis, fuzzyl-logic, differential equations
etc
become available.

1. Are there any lists in which these people congregate? I would like to
join and
even invite them to building this semantic space even if only for the
Swadesh-100
list to test the ideas.

2. If there are people interested in building up this semantic distance
metric
I think they should join language at csam.montclair.edu by sending email to
majordomo at csam.montclair.edu and it can be discussed in detail there.

My own assumption regarding data sets is that there is a kind of critical limit: When you are past that limit, the data set is basically clear and unambiguous, even it is not entirely complete. (it is like an ordinary puzzle: when you have assembled most of the puzzle, you understand what the motive is, even if you haven't got all the details). Unfortunately, very often we are not even close to that critical limit. If you could offer us a practical remedy, most of us would probably be quite happy.

Economists are forced to deal with real world data from different
countries from
different time periods and different soci-economic systems and they have
developed
all sorts of mathematical tools to deal with all problems that crop up.
Linguists
have the same problem. They deal with data from different time periods,
from
different languages with different syntax, and different lexicons.
