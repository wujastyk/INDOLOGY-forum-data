Search for 2 Bengali books
I am looking for a patron for a copy of the following Bengali language book
on Bangladesh politics which does not appear in the Library of Congress
catalog, or Accessions List, or the Bangladesh National Bibliography (at
least I haven't found it there yet), or OCLC.  I told the patron that I would
make a broadcast in case someone owned a personal copy or knew of the
book otherwise.
Shaikh Mizanur Rahman, 1956-
Bangalira Mon, Bangalira  Bhasha.
Dhaka, 1972
The book is a parody of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's Bangladesh, My
Bangladesh, published in Delhi by Orient Longman in 1972.
The other request is from another patron.  She has reason to suspect that
a Bengali version of the autobiography of the American revolutionary leftist
Agnes Smedley, who was involved in politics in both India and China,
entitled Daughter of Earth, may have been published.  I have been unable
to locate any such thing after searching catalogs of Bengali libraries and of
translations into Bengali.  I have asked the patron to search Index
Translationum for herself.  I am not asking anyone to hit the books to find
this but if anyone happens to know of the book or to have a personal copy,
could they please contact me?
Thanks,
