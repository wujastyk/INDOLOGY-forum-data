This is my first message to this conference. I have reading from many,
many scholars and enjoying it.

A friend of mine asked me to find out something I have been wondering
myself about for years:

Lord Krishna stayed with us mayba 160 years, 5000 years ago. He stayed
in Mathura, Vrindavan, Dwarka... where can we find books, articles,
web-pages... as result of research for proves about his life?

Yours, Yashoda devi dasi
