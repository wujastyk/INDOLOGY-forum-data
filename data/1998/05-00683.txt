-vimzati? -vimzatikA?
Probably this is a stupid question, but:
Is there something more than free variation going on in the parallel use of
both VetalapamcavimzatikA and Vetalapamcavimzati? A relatively brief look
at the books I have which might mention this turned up nothing other than
the fact that editions and studies seem to use the two interchangeably (as
far as I could notice in a cursory glance).
