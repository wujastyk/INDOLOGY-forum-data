Sankara, Vivekananda &c.
Etymology of the word "education" : "drawing out", as opposed to
"putting in."
The humorist P.G. Wodehouse was often fond of portraying this
as an old cliched theme favored by stuffy dons who give boring lectures to
schoolchildren. Don't know if Wodehouse got the idea from Vivekananda
or not. :-)
