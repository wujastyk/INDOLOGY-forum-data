An early work, long lost, recently (ie since c1980) rediscovered.
There is at least one opera founded on KAlidAsa's play,

Lots of operas on Indian themes, ranging from the popular "Indian" operas
of early C19 England (Bishop's "Englishmen in India", Smith's "A
Trip to Bengal") many of which featured highly fashionable "Nautch" scenes
(performed by London dancers!), to later classics such as Bizet's "Pearl
Fishers", Delibes' "Lakme" and (I think) Massenet's "Le Roi de Lahore".
Sticking closer to Indian texts, there is Gustav Holst's "Savitri", and his
hymns from the Rig Veda (in translation). Untranslated is the Sanskrit text
(Bhagavad Gita) of Philip Glass's "Satyagraha": I'm
curious as to how European singers approach memorisation.
Also worth mentioning the work of three French composers, Albert Roussel
and Maurice Delage in the early part of this century, and of course Olivier
Messiaen. All three were profoundly influenced by Indian music, rather
than just text. Apart from merely the title of his enormous "Turangalila
Symphonie", Messiaen adopted rhythmic procedures derived from the
Sangitaratnakara, and a type of phrase structure which matches phrase ends
to form "musical rhyme" (comparable to the mukhra of North Indian Music).
Much European music matches phrase beginnings.
An interesting looking book, as yet unread by me, is Gerry Farrell's
"Indian Music and the West" (Oxford University press 1997). This is getting
a little far from core Indology!
