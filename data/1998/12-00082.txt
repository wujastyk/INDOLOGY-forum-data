Epic DAIVAM
The discussion on daiva should not omit to mention the provocative
and insightful treatment by Madeleine Biardeau in her "Nala et Damayanti:
Heros epiques," Parts 1 and 2, Indo-Iranian Journal vol. 27 (1984), 247-74
and vol. 28 (1985), 1-34. As I recall, the chief discussion would be in
Part 2.
