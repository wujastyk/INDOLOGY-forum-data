Does this mean that in Iranian, s>h and c>s occurred simultaneously,
without c becoming a shibilant first? I thought that assibiliztion of
c typically went through an `sh' stage first.

The fundemental question is the historical sequence of the three
changes in Iranian, without any two sounds even getting mixed up.
I don't see how to do it, if we insist that RUKI-s was always sh in
Iranian.
