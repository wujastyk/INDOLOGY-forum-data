        Dear S.PL.,
                The documents from the North known as "lekha"
        and "lipi" were generally written on "burjapatra"
        by painting the letters onto the leaf with "maSI" or
        ink. With such a method a sharp stylus -"elzuththANi'
        can't be used.
                The majority of the Tamil manuscripts have been
        incised on the palmyra leaf - "tAlipatra" or "Olai"
        or "Edu". The instrument "nArAcam" was used for punching a round
        hole at the left end of the palm leaf. A bundle of leaves
        comprising of a full document or a complete book
        could be compiled in order, and then tied by a ribbon
        of rattan thong which is  passed into the respective holes.
        This compilation is known as "cuvadi" or "poththakam".
                Rarely was the word used to mean the stylus.
        "ANi" or "elzuththANi" was the most commonly used word.
                The nArAcam was also a small sharp instrument
        which was used to pierce the ear-drums of people to
        make them deaf. This was a form of punishment.
