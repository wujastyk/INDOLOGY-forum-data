a reelaboration of Njordhr by Saxo (Dumezil : From myth to fiction; the
saga of Hadingus). Similarly, Romulus, at first a shepherd and a twin
(third indo-european function = abundance, wealth, fecundity, health,
pleasure, multiplicity) takes the part of the creator and becomes at the
end of his reign quite similar to Varuna. But his deification in
Quirinus, a third-function god, shows clearly he was not by essence
Varuna?s cousin. 

Rome and India have then a notable common heritage. But we find other
parallels with India after 1000 AD in the " cycle des Narbonnais ", a
legend probably vehicled into France by the Wisigoths. For example, we
discover the parallel of Rudra as a general of a ghostly army. See "
Archeologie de l?Epopee Medievale " by Joel H. Grisward (Paris 1981), a
most serious book.

How could the heirs of the Indo-Europeans keep alive during so many
thousands of years those military rites and legends without practising
war ? Did they truly expand several miles a generation ? I doubt it.
Could the " cycle des Narbonnais " be a heritage 4, 5 or 6 000 years old
? Maybe it could be better explained if the ancestors of the Germans (the
same for the Romans) did not lose contact from the ancestors of the
Indo-Iranians too far in the past.
