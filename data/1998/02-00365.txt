One thing that is interesting here, is that the quality of the Sanskrit
depends partly upon the scholarship of the person writing it, but possibly
also on the target group. When I did statistics on stylistic development of
Skt. in my thesis, I discovered to my absolute astonishment that Somadeva
(he of Kathasaritsagara) was practically undistinguishable from Epic
Sanskrit (regarding, of course, the phenomena I was measuring). Otherwise,
there is a clear tendency in "popular Sanskrit" (if I may coin the term) to
use syntactic devices we find in Prakrits and NIA languages. E.g. the use of
the passive with instrumental agent in the preterite, which eventually is
turned into the ergative construction of such languages as Hindi.

My own study only scratches the surface. There is, I think, much more to be
found. Go for it!
