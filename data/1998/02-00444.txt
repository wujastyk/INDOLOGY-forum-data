Because Prof. Kunjunni Raja has been strongly associated with The Adyar Library Bulletin for a long period, it may be that I attributed the Thakur article to him by mistake. I will confirm by writing to Prof. Raja when I have time, but most probably your information is all that there is to the bibliography on the matter. Thanks for the precise reference. -- aklujkar
