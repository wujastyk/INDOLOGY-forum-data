The above stated sandhi is part of Proto-Dravidian morphophonemics (ca. 3000
BC). It does not correspond in time to MI-rt > .t; I have to look up
Southworth's article again for rt > .t in drav. It is not a common dravidian
development. Hans Hock's arguments are mixed up in chronology. I have a mss
of his article presented in Hawaii (you were also there, Prof. Witzel!) but
not its published form.  He quotes me to support his assumption, but it is
totally misplaced. The Australian ex. is not relevant to the problem of
retroflexion in IA through diffusion. Incidentally my scenario does not
support an entirely internal development of retroflexion within IA. The full
transformation of the IA phonological system must have taken about two
millennia of contact with Dravidian and perhaps Munda. A similar change
happened within most of the Dravidian languages in which voicing and
aspiration became distinctive.  Bh.K.
