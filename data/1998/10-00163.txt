"The Tale of the Indo-European Horse Sacrifices."
Hi,

I am not Indian, I have done some elementary Latin and I did not feel
uneasy. :-) I gave the example of a French word so that you 'see' the
'clivage' of con-naissance. I am assuming that you are French, please
correct me. I am glad that Cocteau said that about 'connaitre'. He
said quite a few interesting things besides this, eg:- 'Le mirroir
ferait bien de reflechir avant nous renvoyer notre image' (or
something to that effect) = 'It would be better if the mirror could
reflect before sending back our image'. :-)
I have just been educated on the difference between 'jan' and
'j~naa' by Dr Wujastyk!
I was just giving the traditional explanation from a Banarasi paNDita:
'j' is the vyanjana connected with birth; in the broader sense. In
this context, there is no big difference between 'jan' and
'j~naa'. However, please bear in mind that I am an astronomer... :-)
I know that some people like to use Panini's grammar for many root
derivation purposes. The traditionally educated paNDitas think
otherwise. They have a more ahistorical approach.
Best wishes,
Girish
