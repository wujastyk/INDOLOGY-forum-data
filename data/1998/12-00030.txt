Vicious Debate
* The word "Musa" in Sanskrit is "Mouse" in English : So
* What ? But anyway, that's really beside the point.
  This relationship is one of the main concerns in
  historical linguistics.
*Well, that is their opinion. What [..] Bharatiyas should know is that
*mindless text-torturing is irrelevant and undesirable. What's
*important is not the origin of who wrote the Vedas but what is in
* them.
  For historians of religion and others who study ancient
  cultures, this origin question is very important.
