usually considered an innovation, must be ancient.  From this meaning
developed the semantics that are more widely represented in IE: "to
bring" --> "to carry".
   ? Drav. "to choose, collect" || S.Drav. *per_ukk-: Tamil, Malayal.
<per_ukku>, Toda <per_k->, Kodagu <pori"k-> || Telugu <pedz^ipi>,
<pedz^dz^u> || C.Drav.: Kolamo <petk->, Naiki <pett->, Parji <ped->,
Gadaba (Salur) <pidz^->, Gondi (Adilabad) <per->, Konda <per_->, Kui
<pebg-> (< *peg-b-) || Kurux <pes-> || See DED 293.
   Alt || Tur. *bary-: OTur., OUigh. <barym> "possession"; Azer.
<baryn-> (Gazax) <barym-> "to make use of, to receive advantage";
OTur. (TS 2, 104) <baryn-> "to earn a living", Turkish (Edirne)
<bary-> "to care for, protect"; Cf. Hung. <barom>, OHung. <barum>
"cattle" (<-- "possessions"), borrowed from OBulg. (Gombocz BTL
40-41) || Mong. "to take with the hands, to seize" (and further "to
offer s.o. s.t."): MMong. <va:r->, Kalmyk <ba"r'->, Moghol <bari->;
see Poppe Mong. 26, Zirni 89 || Cf. Ramstedt KW 38 (where, as in Ram.
56, a connection of the Mong. words is also suggested with Tur.
*barNak "finger").  In Turk., the semantic development was "to take"
   <> Cf. Ramstedt JSFOu 53(1), 23, Dolg. 12 (IE ~ Alt).  The basic
meaning "to take" is maintained in Alt., Drav. and partially IE.  In
Drav., *a > e umlaut apparently took place under influence of a front
vowel in the second syllable in the position before <r_> (as with
Drav. *e:r_- "to rise" < *Hora", #116).
