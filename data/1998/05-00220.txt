Kannada vacanas
S.Krishna writes on Sun, May 10, '98.
sangamEzwara is the nome of the diety. "kUDala sangamEzwara" means
sangamEzwara at the confluence of the rivers.
There seems to be a practice of constructing siva temples at
river confluences and naming the diety as sangamEzwara.
One such temple at the confluence of krishNA and tungabhadrA
threatened by zrisailam project has been dismantled stone by
stone and reconstructed at alampuram near Kurnool.
