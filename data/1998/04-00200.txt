Harindranath Chattopadhyaya
My friend and colleague Dr Jayandra Soni sent me the following
message in the hope that someone will be able to help him.
      Harindranath Chattopadhyaya
Dear Roland,
I am collecting any available material on and by Harindranath
Chattopadhyaya (1898-1990). This poet-philosopher, politician and
artist is famous, among other things, for his Quatrains of the Curd
Seller (1959), long out of print, and even some of acquaintances were
unsuccessful in locating a copy for me. I was wondering if you could
also pass on this request to your friends in the Liverpool list.
Perhaps someone there also may be able to help me. With thanks, Jay
