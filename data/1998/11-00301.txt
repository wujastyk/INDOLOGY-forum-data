Thanks to Lars Martin Fosse, Rebecca Manring
and Yaroslav V. Vassilkov for their answers.

Of course, when I said "European stages", I did not mean
to exclude the United States of America (to mention at least
one country outside Europe ...).

I think I should may be further extend my question
to performances of translations
into modern languages (including English)
of classical Sanskrit plays on Indian stages.

The general question being of course
"Where is Sanskrit theatre alive?"
in the sense that we can say that
Shakespeare is alive to-day in Paris:
1. you can go today or tomorrow
 to the Th?atre de la Ville and see
 a performance (in French) of
 "La Nuit des Rois" ("Twelfth Night")
2. you can go today or tomorrow
 to the Th?atre Lucien Paye and see
 a performance (in French) of
 "Rom?o et Juliette" ("Romeo and Juliet")
3. you can go today or tomorrow
 to the Th?atre l'Ath?n?e and see a play
 "librement inspir?e de William Shakespeare"
 under the title of "La Trag?die de Coriolan"

Where is Bhavabhuti alive?
Where is Kalidasa alive?
Why are they not so very much alive as Shakespeare is?
 (I tend to think this is partly because the field of INDOLOGY
  has been from the beginning confiscated to some extent
  by indo-europeanists but this is of course
  a very partial answer .... :-)
  and not a criticism ;-)
