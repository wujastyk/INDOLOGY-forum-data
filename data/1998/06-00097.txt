That would mean linking Brahuis (Dravidians) to the Central Asian cultures.
That's another interesting point that has been never much discussed here
(at least I can not remember) - the origin of Dravidians. I remember
reading somewhere (alas, I do not know where) the hypothesis of original
Dravidian homeland in Central Asia. Do venerable shi.s.tas have any opinion
on this?
