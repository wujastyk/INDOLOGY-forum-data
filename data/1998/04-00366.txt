Telugu history
I was under the impression:
Uday Reddy, reddy at reddy.cs.uiuc.edu wrote back:
+Well, actually, I think the Muslim rule in the North helped the
+Dravidian languages, in that the pressure of Sanskrit eased.  (It also
+helped the North Indian languages the same way.)  Almost all the big
+kingdoms before 1000 AD, Satavahana, Chalukya and Rashtrakuta promoted
+Sanskrit or Prakrit.  There was NO patronage for Telugu.  (Kannada
+fared a little better somehow.)  But after 1000 AD, things changed and
+Telugu developed enormously.  Basically, there was no Sanskrit
+imperialism after the Muslims came into India.
Uday is a native Telugu from AP.
Any thoughts?
