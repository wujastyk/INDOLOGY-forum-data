Horse, Indo-Iranians, nomads and origins?
May I humbly inquire, only because there seems to be some illogic going
on here: considering nomadic cultures, how can one postulate a "more
compact source of origin"? I assume one can hypothesize a geographical
area which is traversed by a nomadic culture, but if that area is
extremely large, a vast expanse of teritory,  then what?  How does one
identify in this case a "compact source of origin", especially since
nomads leave a less concentrated archaeological record of their presence
than do settled people.
Cautiously yours,
J. Kirkpatrick

While this might work archaeologically, and is convenient in so far as
it bypasses the need for refuting either an 'into' or 'out of' India
model I suspect that most linguists would say that a language family
needs a more compact source of origin for its members to develop
significant shared morphological and lexical features (based on the
geographical history of other language families that are presently
known).   Regards,
