Oops
As it so happens, I presumed Dr. Ganesan's inquiries regarding the
popularity of Srimad Bhagvat Gita were directed at me. That last response
was a slip on my part. I should have mailed him (Dr. Ganesan) directly and
not posted here as his questions weren't specifically directed at me but at
everyone in general. Sorry about that.
