Hindu iconography and communication of ideas
Friends,
I shall be grateful for guidance on literature on the subject of ancient icons
of gods and goddesses carrying weapons (apart from the classics of TA
Gopinatha Rao and JN Banerjea). In particular, on s'akti pi_t.has in NW India
and the iconography of Durga as mother goddess in ancient India and perhaps in
Mesopotamia.
Thanks and best regards,
Dr. S. Kalyanaraman
