Paired Horse and PIE breakup

Turkish 'yarim' = half. So this could mean 'half-sighted'.
One of the others (Scythians) calls a drink 'achy'. That means
'bitter' or 'sour' in Turkic.
'er' happens to be one word meaning 'man' or 'male' or 'husband'
scattered
throughout Turkic languages in many forms (erkek, erk, erkin, erkisi, or
even in
combination with other words like kochxar = male sheep, etc)
and there is no other word to take its place. IT seems difficult to
believe
that they did not have words for male or female  until the Iranians
taught them.
Besides this 'ar' can be found among Nilo-Saharans and may be from
the ME protoworld.
These are dangerous territories. 'Deniz'/Tenngiz' means 'sea' in Turkic
and is well established in other forms like 'tennger' (in l~r Turkic and
Hungarian). Herodotus says that the 'barbarians' call all large bodies
of
water 'eridanus', and 'iri' or 'irig/ is Turkic for 'large'. 'Tang'
means
the heavens, so the root seems to refer to 'large bluish expanse'.
Tengri,
or Tanri means 'sky god' more or less. Furthermore those words can
easily
be etymologized as 'danu-apar' and 'danus-tur' so people who created
them
are simply ignoring other evidence or are unaware of them. Furthermore
'krau' or 'kirau' means 'frost' in Turkic, and 'kash' means 'rock,
stone'.
There are other etymologies for "Caucasus" also, like 'Kolkh' (Colchis),
kash-kash (as in the Kaskha, enemies of Hittites).
Furthermore, this is an easy game to play. 'Tong' or 'don' means 'to
freeze' and could refer to the "don" river. Even more so, Miziev thinks
the Danube/Dunay/Duna is from 'Tynay' from Turkic 'tyn' meaning 'quiet'
i.e. the 'quiet Don'. The root 'tam/dam' means 'drop' and could have
easily referred to water falling.
Miziev says the Kimmers were also protoTurkic. In the same way that
Subar/Sabir/Suvash/Chuvash referred to 'river-men' (i.e. sub=water)
kam-er refers to river-men. There are rivers in Asia in Turkic
territories
that have the name 'khem/kam' in them. The confluence of the rivers
Zelenchuk & Kuban in the Caucasus is called "ullu kam" in
karachay-balkar.
The word for ship in Turkic is 'keme/geme'. The word for island (Miziev)
is ayirakam (river-splitter, from ayir=split, and kam=river). That makes
it even more likely that some form of proto-Turkic was in that region
before the Scythians.
There are linguistic criteria for many of these; ie.. for Avar,
Hun, etc. Kutrigur and Utigur are easily Turkic words.
There are others who have concluded it's Turkic i..e Pritsak. Right
now the Turkic side is believed. IT is furthermore believed that they
spoke l~r Turkic and not sh~z Turkic.
The Xiong-Nu may not even have been the same
That is not right. The Norse version of it 'atli' is a perfectly
good Turkic word meaning 'horseman'. This problem arises because
they first assume that 'atti' is Germanic for father when they
should know by now that 'ata' is Turkic for father in practically
every Turkic language, and words like ata, apa, ana, amma, appa, akka,
atta, are all Turkic words referring to parents. It is completely the
reverse; for Vernadsky takes perfectly good Turkic words and makes
them Slavic, i.e. Besmer (bezmez, or bezmer), Asperuk (es-berir or
esberik).
Too many Turkic scholars seem to be closet Iranists or all politically
motivated, or unduly influenced by IEnists and particularly Iranists.
People have done similar things and have also turned Turkic writing
into Iranian. For example, the Zelencuk inscription or the Alanian
greeting have been give as Iranian for a long time, but Miller had to
do hokus-pokus to get the Zelenchuk Inscription as Iranian. I now have
a picture of the inscription and what Miller did to it, explained by
Miziev. He erased letters and made other substitutions and created a
mumbo-jumbo whereas without erasing any letters one can create
meaningful sentences in Turkic.
