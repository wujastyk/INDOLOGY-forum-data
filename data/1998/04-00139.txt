[Announce] Ramayana in devanagari on Internet (fwd)
Ramayana in devanagari on Internet
namaskaar,
Valmiki Ramayana text is now online as devanagari web pages in XDVNG fonts
(devanagari fonts available for UNIX, PC and MAC - based on Velthuis
dvng font face) or as devanagari postscript files at
http://www.hscc.net/ramayana/
These are available for selection on a chapter by chapter basis.
This Devanagari version of the Ramayana is based on  Prof. John Smith's
modified CSX version of the original encoding by Prof. Muneo Tokunaga of
Kyoto, Japan. These pages would not be possible without Prof. Tokunaga's
monumental effort in encoding the whole RAmAyaNa of the Baroda Critical
Edition.
My sincere gratitude to both of them for their permission
to post this devanagari version of Ramayana on the Internet.
I request you to view the pages and offer suggestions for improvement.
Please forward the information to others who might be interested.
Thanks & Regards,
Shree
