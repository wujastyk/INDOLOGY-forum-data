epic marriage
In reply to Dominique Thillaud's question about the legality of
the wedding between Arjuna and Subhadra, Georg Von simson says:
 You may be right that the introduction of Kuntibhoja in
as
  My "prazna" on  this: Since Subhadra was "kidnapped" for the wedding
by Arjuna, do the DharmazAstra rules apply strictly? As my understanding
goes, the bride was always blameless in case of a "forced" marriage and
the rules governing "forced" marriages were different from that of
arranged marriages; so can the conventional rules be invoked for a
special case like this?
