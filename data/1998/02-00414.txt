CSX fonts
Hello,
Thanks for your answer to my question. I actually forgot to mention in my
last message that the Washington Indic .PK fonts work fine under TeX. But
then TeX is a world unto itself anyway.
I have actually solved the problem since I last wrote, purely by luck, by
changing over to a different Windows 95 text editor (Ultra Edit). This can
handle the Indic truetype fonts perfectly well. I should be able to use this
encoding directly within TeX, if I have understood the Itrans documentation
properly, and thus not have to rewrite about 2000 examples in my thesis.
I would still not mind knowing why those characters were missing in Linux
though.
Thanks for your help,
DB
