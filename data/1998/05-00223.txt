Asoka: a new link
Prof. Peter Schalk, Uppsala university asked me:
*I saw your list of publications. You mention: "I. Mahadevan and R.
*Nagaswamy has written on this inscription of Tagaduur Atiyamaan, a friend
*of Avvai." I know what Nagaswamy has written, but not Mahadevan. Can you
*give an exact bibliographical note?
Please see:
I. Mahadevan, 1994, Recent discoveries of Jaina cave inscriptions
in Tamilnadu, Rishabh Saurabh, Delhi, p. 116-134
R. Nagaswamy, 1981, Asoka and Tamil country: a new link,
The Indian Express Sunday magazine, 6 Dec. 1981
