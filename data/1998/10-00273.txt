Dear Tibor Kovacs,
you will find a lot of material and an interesting bibliography in
David Gordon White, The Alchemical Body, Chicago and London, The
University of Chicago Press 1996.
MIna/Matsendra/Macchanda  is usually mentioned as the founder of the
Kula school.
Debabrata Sen Sharma has edited the Matsyendra SaMhita which is
ascribed to MatsendranAtha. Calcutta 1994.
Regards,
Birgit Mayer-Koenig
