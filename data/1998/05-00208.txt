Horse argument revisited

'Srednij' using the official Akademija Nauk transcription (where <j>

The argument indeed does not necessarily imply unbroken association
with _domesticated_ horses, just with horses.
The *k^u in *ek^uo- is, as you say, also found in *k^uon-, *k^un-
"dog", which is not likely to be a loanword in PIE.  The combination
of *k^ or *k with *w (as opposed to the single labio-velar *kw) is a
rare one, but it does occur in some other words as well (*kuapno-
"smoke" [Grk. kapnos, Lat. vapor, Lith kvapas], *kuatH- "to seethe,
boil, ferment" (Skt. kvath-, Lat. caseus > cheese, Russ kvas, etc.).
There is no need from "internal reconstruction" to think that PIE
*ek^wos is a borrowing, but if it is, a ready source can be found in
Proto-Yeniseian *ku?s- "horse", Proto-Dagestanian *kwaccwV "mare"
(unlike Altaic, Yeniseian and NE Caucasian *are* plausible candidates
for being descended from the Ur-inhabitants of the steppe, c.
8000-5000 BC, before the Indo-Europeans moved in).  In any case, the
word predates the domestication.
Greek <hippos> (Myc. i-qo) is curious, and must surely descend from a
form with preposed *y- (*yek^wos > *yik^wos, by vowel assimilation),
cf. Tocharian B yakwe, A yuk.
