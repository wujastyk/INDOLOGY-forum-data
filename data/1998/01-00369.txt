Last I knew (about a year ago) there was still a legal wrangle going on
concerning the Bangalore estate.  (It abutted the land of the school where
my children went from 1994-95, so I went past it frequently.)  I believe
that Roerich's secretary or someone in that role made claims on the
property, and as we have recently discussed, such cases are not usually
resolved rapidly.  :-)
