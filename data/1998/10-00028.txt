Subject: Help with a zloka
Message-ID: <161227041639.23782.14891709629851032036.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I'm looking for a samskr*t zloka ( a fairly elementary zubhASitam) that
translates as:

"Good friendship is like the shadow of a tree in the afternoon; it
starts off by being small and lengthens as a function of time,
Bad friendship is like the shadow of a tree in the early part of the
day; it starts off by being long and reduces as a function of time"


  I would be greatful to anybody for the samskr*t original and the
source.

Regards,
Krishna
