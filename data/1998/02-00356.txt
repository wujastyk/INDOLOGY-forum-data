The "classic" for this form of the "Jesus-was-in-India"-theory is
Nicolas Notovitch's book: La vie inconnue de Jesus-Christ. Paris
1894. At that time this book aroused a great upstir in Europe,
it was very often reprinted and was translated in other European
languages as well. During a travel through Ladakh, Notovitch
allegedly found an old Tibetan book in the monastery of Hemis
which was translated from a Pali (!) original. A short time after
the publication Max Mueller wrote an article where all this is
clearly unmasked as a forgery.

You'll find a critical assessment in a book of Guenter Groenbold
who is an indologist and tibetologist (and known as a serious
scholar):
        Groenbold, Guenter:
        Jesus in Indien : Das Ende einer Legende. -- Muenchen :
        Koesel, 1985. -- 152 pp.

Groenbold took pains to unravel the different threads of this
theory which are often mixed together. For example, Notovitch
deals only with Jesus' "lost years", he did obviously not know
the story that Jesus survived the crucification and died later in
Kashmir. This form of the Jesus legend appeared first with Ghulam
Ahmad, the founder of the Ahmadiyya movement.

If one has sense of humour the reading of this sort of literature
is great fun, otherwise it is merely annoying.
