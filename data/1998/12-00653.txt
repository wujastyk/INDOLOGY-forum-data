SV: Hindu traditional view

[Lars Martin Fosse]
The AIT is not simply based on the interpretation of the Vedas (if that is
what you refer to as a group of religious hymns).  The AIT is based on the
combined interpretation of a vast material of a literary, linguistic and
archaeological character, involving Iranian as well as Greek, Italic,
Germanic, Slavonic, Baltic sources. In the final analysis, the AIT depends
upon the interpretation of the Indo-European material as a totality.
