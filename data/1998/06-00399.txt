Dear Dr. Thrasher,

Thanks for citing Agrawala's title! Infact I could find his work in U of
Tuebingen library, and infact two more elsewhere (one by Yadav, and the
other by ??). What I am precisely looking for is information about this
temple in the suburbs of Poona.

Thanks and Regards,
Sreenivas
