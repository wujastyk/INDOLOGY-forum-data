I may have made a mistake or overlooked something, but the macros for combining consonants don't seem to work. Is the font "Sanskrit New" (referred to in the macros Conjnct 1-3) something which will make the utility more complete or is it just an older name for "Sanskrit 1.2"? I.e., does "Sanskrit 1.2" cover all the possible combinations, so that a slight change in the macros will do?
