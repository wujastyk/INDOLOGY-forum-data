One basic text on this matter is an article by Hermann Jacobi. I do not have the precise reference, but it is included in his _Kleine Schriften_, publ. by the Von Glasenapp-Stiftung (in that famous series of green volumes of 'kleine Schriten' by various German-language Indologists). I remember having read it as a student with great profit.
