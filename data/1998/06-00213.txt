Although George already posted the Skt. for NighaNTu 1.11 and Nirukta
2.23, I am pasting it all together here along with a few more details
on VAc, for easy reference.


NighaNTu 1.11:


zlokaH | dhArA | ifA [f = Vedic L]| gauH | gaurI | gandharvI | gabhIrA
| gambhIrA | mandrA | mandrAjanI | vAzI | vANI | vANIcI | vANaH | paviH
| bhAratI | dhamaniH | nAfI [in some MSS nIliH] | mefiH | menA [in some
MSS meniH]| sUryA | sarasvatI | nivit | svAhA | vagnuH [in some MSS
gagnuH] | upabdiH | mAyuH | kAkut [in some MSS kAkup] | jihvA | ghoSaH
| svaraH | zabdaH | svanaH | Rk | hotrA | gIH | gAthA | gaNaH | dhenA |
gnAH [in some MSS gnA] | vipA | nanA [in some MSS nagnA] | kazA |
dhiSaNA | nauH | akSaram | mahI | aditiH | zacI | vAk | anuSTup |
dhenuH | valguH [in some MSS vagnuH] | galdA | saraH [in some MSS
rasaH] | suparNI | bekurA-iti saptapaJcAzadvAGnAmAni || 11 ||


George:

"p.s. I wonder if there is any significance to the variant reading for
saras: rasaH."


Out of the above 57 names of vAc, Nirukta elaborates only on one:
sarasvatI, which "is [the only one] used both in the sense of 'a river'
and of 'a deity' in Vedic passages" (nadIvad devatAvacca nigamA
bhavanti).

As I see it, this is the sense of "whith reference to these," which is
L.S.'s translation of *tatra* in Nir. 2.23 below.


Nirukta 2.23:


vAGnAmAnyuttarANi saptapaJcAzat | vAk kasmAd | vaceH | tatra
sarasvatItyetasya nadIvad devatAvacca nigamA bhavanti | tad yad

L. Sarup's (complete) translation of Nirukta 2.23:


'The following fifty-seven (words) [in the NighaNTu] are synonyms of
