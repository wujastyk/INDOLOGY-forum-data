>Dear Collegues
>
>I was asked to teach a free Course on Indian
Society and Culture to
>students from a big variety of courses:
Philosophy, Linguistics,
>Anthropology,History, etc.The course is open to
all the students of the
>University. Before I know wich are the backgroud
of my students I was asked
>to write a previous programme. My problem is how
to elaborate a programme
>for students of such a diverse background and
without any knowledge   about
>indian cultura. The ignorance about India in
Portugal is generalised. I
>have already teached a couse on Indian Cultura
and Society to students of
>Antropology wich was easear for me as I am an
antropologist though with a
>very strong componente of Indology, knowledge of
Sanskrit , hindi, Indian
>liteature, philosophy and history.
>By chance any of you ever had to teach such a
kind of course to students
>with various educational background? Could
someone give me some sugestions
>on the content of the progrmma and how to start?
I would like to give a
>general and integrated knowledge of Indian
cultura, its past and relation
>to the present culture and society in order to
motivate students to work on
>Indian matters.
>
>
>Thanks for help
>and patience with frivolous inquiry.
