kanakadAsa came from a zrIvaiSNava background.. From what I know, he
came from a wealthy buNT i.e. (shepherd?) family near mangaLUru and was
orphaned early in life. HE then wandered around and finally settled down
in uDupi and most of his songs were composed in uDupi. I was also under
the impression that since his ideas are accepted as part of the dvaitic
corpus, he was more a dvaitin.  Were his parents zrIvaiSNava?  Was there
a lot of zrIvaiSNava activity at any point of time in the uDupi area?
Can you please elaborate on this....

Vidyansankar Sundaresan says that there was no stylistic change from the
"ankita" of the saraNa and the dAsakUTa schools ..Firstly, kanakadAsa's
kAginEle kEzava , AFAIK has nothing to do with uDupi
whose krSNa temple he was associated with( viz the kanakanda khiDkI
episode) but with the village of kAginEle where he was born and left
at a fairly young age; I therefore believe that this ankita has nothing
do with the temple i.e. uDupi with which he was associated. Out of the
many dAsas who named themselves after viTThala, I am not sure of how
many actually visited/became sannyAsins/had their iStadEvata as viTThala
of pandharpUr( Their region  of activity was more in the vicinity of
north-eastern/central karnATaka i.e. rAyichUr
and in Southern/Western karnATaka) where even today there is a strong
dvaitic presence in the temples. I therefore believe that there was a
big stylistic change in that the poets were refering to themsleves in
the first person and included their signature even when writing about
MULTIPLE dieties which is certainly not the case with the zaraNas.


  S.Palaniappan wants to know the origin of the name "kUDala sangama".
