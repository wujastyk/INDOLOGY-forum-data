"vELAppArppAn2": potter-priest or non-sacrificing brahmin?
Hi,
The superb analysis linking archaeology, accounting,
literary texts and Tamil heritage is fascinating.
Is it clear from the Harappan artefacts that the
professions of a potter and a blacksmith were
differentiated at that time, ca. 3000 B.C.? Is
it possible that the fire-worker worked with
faience, silica, silver (there are two silver seals!)and copper plates
?(Note: he even incised on bronze implements). Is there any other
contemporaneous civilization which used copper plates to record the
conveyance of property rights?
Regards,
Kalyanaraman.
 The potters' connection to
Plates, other> inscriptions, and potters." Tamil Lexicon even mentions
a sub-caste among
