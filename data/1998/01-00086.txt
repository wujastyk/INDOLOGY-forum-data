See the following two articles in M. Jansen and G. Urban (ed.), Interim
Reports vol. 2: Reports on field work carried out at Mohenjo-Daro,
Pakistan, 1983-84 by the IsMEO - Aachen University Mission, Aachen: German
Research Project Mohenjo-Daro, RWTH, and Rome: Istituto Italiano per il
Medio ed Estremo Oriente, 1987:

pp. 169-181: G. Mustafa Shar, The Mohanna: An unknown life on the Indus river.
pp. 183-185: Salma Sultana Begum, Boats on the Indus.

I used these when giving the Sindhi terms in the caption of a photo by my
photographer Jyrki Lyytikka published on page 13 (fig. 1.9) of my
"Deciphering the Indus script" (Cambridge U.P. 1994). I notice now that I
have failed to give these references in the notes and bibliography.

Best regards, Asko Parpola
