[Announcement] New devanagari font (fwd)
re devanagari font
Dear Sirs,
   We have recently finished a devanagari font.  It is comprised of 365
charaters and was designed for Sanskrit.  Though you might be interested in
knowing of it.  It is available through Theosohical University Press.  We have
a sample page at:
