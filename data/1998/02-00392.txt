read your message). From which it follows that you, being me, would have
no reason NOT to indicate that the publication in question might be
useful; from which we can conclude that, ESPECIALLY if you were me, you
would be more than likely to "recommend" this book :-)

Anyway, thanks for the information.

Now, me being me, I recommend without any hesitation another publication
which recently came my way -

Shigeaki Watanabe: koten Caarvaaka-ha no ninshikiron - danpen no keifuu
(the epistemology of the classical Caarvaaka school: Genealogy of
Fragments). Journal of Naritasan Institute for Buddhist Studies 17:
Papers in Honour of the Reverend Chief Abbot Shoseki Tsurumi on the
Occasion of His 77th Birthday, 1994, pp. 11-131.

I can't remember whether Watanabe actually gives titles of Lokaayata
texts (which was the original question), but he gives plenty of Sanskrit
passages which *might*, in turn, mention titles (which I would know, if
I had the article right here, but I don't).

Counterfactually yours,
