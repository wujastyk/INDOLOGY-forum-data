Query: 11th World Sanskrit Congress in Turin?
As far as I know a proposal to organize the 11th IASS conference in Turin
came from the Ce.S.M.E.O. (via Cavour 17, 10123 Turin, ITALY, tel.
39+11+546564). I have no more information in detail at present. I suggest
anyone interested to contact directly the Ce.S.M.E.O.
Best regards,
