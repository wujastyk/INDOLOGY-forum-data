A couple of years ago I wrote a paper on navagraha worship
in Sanskrit texts under the tilte:
`Planet Worship in the {\em Y\={a}j\~navalkyasm\d{r}ti}'.
Unfortunately this papers is still waiting for publication.
For your reference, I just cut and paste here a table of contents
of my paper and titles of Sanskrit texts which I used (in LaTeX format).
If you need further information I will write to you privately.

I hope the paper is published in a year.
