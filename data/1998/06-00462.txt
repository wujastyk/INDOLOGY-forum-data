Thank you for this information.
Am I right in assuming that "aTTabuya karan" in Kanchi is the same as
described by R. Champakalakshmi (1981):"appears to date from at least
the sixth century A.D. as there is a reference to it in one of the hymns
of PEyAlvAr..."-?
I didn't know anything about the other shrine in Tiruvallikkeni until
you wrote me.
Is there any publication or photography available of the scene that you
described ?
Sincerely,
