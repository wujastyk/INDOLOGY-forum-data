This is also my advise.

At the time of my last visit to Tanjore Library (which has no curator but
only an officer-in-charge), two years ago, I was not allowed to make
photographs of MSS (and I even had to overcome  many difficulties just to
consult two or three MSS I needed). If the MSS that interest you are among
those already microfilmed under the IGNCA project, you can ask for a
duplicate (in Tanjore, not in Delhi). An answer in the positive is not to
be taken for granted; however, in my case I was lucky enough (but only
after much insistence, getting angry, showing a letter of K. Vatsyayan,
etc.) to obtain a duplicate in three days.

With best wishes (literally),
