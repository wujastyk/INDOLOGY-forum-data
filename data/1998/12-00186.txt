Himachal
Hello All,
I'm trying to track down the Sanskrit source for the following quote:
"There is no mountain like Himachal, for in it are Kailas and Manasarovar.
As the dew is dried up by the morning sun, so are the sins of mankind
dried up at the sight of Himachal."
E.T. Atkinson in his Himalayan Gazetteer refers to the above as coming
from the Manasa Khanda (purportedly part of the Skanda Purana), and C.A.
Sherring in Western Tibet and the Indian Borderland says that it's from
the Ramayana.  If anyuone could help clear this up for me, I'd be very
grateful.  More specific references to where in either text this quote can
be found would especially be appreciated.
Thanks,
Paul Cooper
