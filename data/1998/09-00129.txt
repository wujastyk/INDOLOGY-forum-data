Best computer for Sanskrit?
Hello,
        I am an amateur, but in my brief experience, I have found
Linux to be the best platform for this kind of work. The xdvng
devanagari fonts allow me to browse devanagari websites without
effort, the itrans package is excellent for creating new web
pages. The Emacs editor also has an excellent support for composing,
viewing and saving articles in Devanagari fonts. Unicode support in
Linux is also pretty good. Linux is far more stable than any version
of Windows I have used.
        I am using Redhat Linux v5.1, running on a Pentium-400. All of
the above software was free, and I bought the operating system for
about 50 bucks, but it can be downloaded via the Net for free also,
from www.redhat.com. Let me know if you need any more information.
