Um, this examplifies quite neatly just how useless a background in nuclear
physics is in a question concerning historical lexicography and philology.
As has already been pointed out, the linguistic evidence points to the
word having entered Indian languages from Portuguese.
Words don't just "transform" from one thing into another.  There are
phonological laws involved, and not everything is possible (including
"master > mEstrI").
All the best,
