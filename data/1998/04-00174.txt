It strikes me that two of the Kh. Shina words with /q/ cited by you are
frog words; Turner (CDIAL #9746), re ma.n.dUka- (presumably source
of Kh. Shina ma'noqu) refers to "many aberrant
forms in NIA...due to taboo".  Perhaps this is relevant.  Note
also that 'thooNqar',
'a species of frog' is the only word listed by you with /q/ in medial
position.
