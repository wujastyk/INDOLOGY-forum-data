learning sanskrit

I don't know anything you could use in conjunction with Hart, but in
addition to what you have already found, I would make the following suggestions:
You may find the following book useful: Walter Harding Maurer, "The Sanskrit
Language. An Introductory Grammar and Reader", Curzon Press 1995.
It contains a number of graded reading exercises that are fairly simple. The
only weakness is that the exercises have not been translated. You may still
find it useful.
You could furthermore read the prose sections of the Mahabharata in
connection with van Buitenen's translation: Mbh I.3.1ff; 3.190ff. These
texts are easy. Lanman's reader contains a number of fairly easy texts with
comments. The selections from the Hitopadesha are good for beginners. You
might want a copy of a the translation.
The major upanishads have been translated by Patrick Olivelle recently. You
could read the Skt. text in conjunction with his translation. Upanishadic
language is not too difficult.
