    There are some peoples in the world who believe that foreigners
(preferable Europeans) originated from sexual union of a runaway criminal
and a female pig.
    In Sumer (and probably China) the state ideology supported a myth
according to which all the merchant goods imported into the country came not
as a result of trade exchange, but were just a tribute or a sign of submission
from neighbouring nations to a local king (Emperor) - the "Ruler of the World".
    The well-known purANic myth which ascribes to all nations living to the
West of the Sindhu and to the North of Hindukush an origin from
excommunicated criminals belongs to the same type of "political folklore".
    Do you really think ethnocentric and racist fables of this kind can
"contribute to our discussion of Aryan homeland"? Or may be you do think
that they can contribute to better mutual understanding between people
of different nations?
