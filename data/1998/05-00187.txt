Does IE have distinct words for wild and domesticated horses?
Regarding solitary dating of horse remains, there is an obvious bias
as to which ones are accepted and which ones are not. For example,
it has been mentioned that some horses have been found in an IVC
context.  I might also mention that remains of Equus Sivalensis
possibly going back as far as 8000 BCE have been found in a Neolithic
burial with associated artifacts in Southeast Asia!  (See Maria

Microlith Cultural Level, Lemery Archaeological Site_  (Manila:
Ateneo de Manila University: 1981).
