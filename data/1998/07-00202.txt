There were two followups by V. Rao to which SP answered.

  To me, this finding of relationship between Dravidian phonology and
  Fortunatov's law has important implications for the sociolinguistic
  history of India and origin of retroflexion in IA.
  Is the Dravidian origin of retroflexion on a much firmer ground?
  What do Indologists think?
