Indra is the LokapAla of the east direction. The directions are generally
surveyed starting from the east and clockwise. In Tantric ritual texts one
often sees the expression indrAdI"sAnaparyantam meaning "from east to
north-east" (ex. AjitAgama XXIX.195). In this way indrAdayaH surAH may be
the LokapAla-s.
