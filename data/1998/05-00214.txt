So what?  If modern Central Asians look like ancient Central Asians,
it's because biologically they are still largely Iranian.  What does
that have to do with the "original IE stock", whatever that means?
What *do* you believe is the "stock believed to be the original
speakers of Indo-European langugaes"?
Inscriptions, manuscripts, a body of literature...
No it isn't.  See: W. Krause/W. Thomas, "Tocharisches Elementarbuch",
2 volumes, Heidelberg 160, 1964.
You are simply inverting the arguments of the outdated "Aryan
invasion" theorists.
It's a steppe isn't it?
Suttee?  You are simply inverting the arguments of the outdated

Like the ancient Germans/Slavs?
All typical of *any* horse-based steppe pastoralist culture.  Says
nothing about the language.
I wouldn't be a linguist if I believed that!  Yenisey-Ostyak, the old
name for Ket, is closely allied to the extinct Yug, Kott, Arin,
Pumpokol and Assan languages, together forming the Yeniseian family.
They are unrelated to either Altaic or Uralic, and in fact the
Yeniseian family is best considered a small isolate family (links to
North Caucasian and Sino-Tibetan have been suggested, but are not
entirely convincing).
There is no such thing as a Ural-Altaic family, that's a 19th century
construct that has been utterly disproved.  There may not even be an
Altaic family.  Current consensus is that Mongol and Tungusic are
related, and probably further linked to Korean and Japanese.  The
similarities between Turkic and Mongol-Tungus(-Korean-Japanese) are
now thought to be due to areal diffusion.  Turkic is best treated as
an isolate for the time being.
