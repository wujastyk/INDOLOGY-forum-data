Indo-Aryan invasion
Lars Martin Fosse wrote:
When I say Indo-Aryan I mean Indo-Aryan which already had developed out of PIE at least by 3000
BCE. In that period we see developing a culture in North-Western India which alone can have caused
the observed linguistic uniformity: the Sindhu-Sarasvati-culture. Also in many aspects of material
culture it shows an extraordinary internal uniformity and standardisation. After the collapse of
this culture India has seldom seen a comparable period of unity, but strong unifying and converging
forces stayed at work till today. After all, the modern Indo-Aryan languages are not that much
diverse and have with the partial exception of the Dardic group developed together along similar
lines.
