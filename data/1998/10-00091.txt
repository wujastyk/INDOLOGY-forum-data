Ramayana comparisons
A rather late but, I hope, still useful response to John Grimes' query.   In addition
to the items mentioned by Yarozlav Vassilkov, Christophe Vielle and others, there are
the following items that spring to mind immediately.   Others could be found by
consulting the _Epic and Puranic Bibliography (up to 1985)_ (Purana Research
Publications 3) Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden, 1992, or my _The Sanskrit Epics_, E. J. Brill,
Leiden, 1998.

These are of varying quality.
