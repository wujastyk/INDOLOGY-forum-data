Tamil words in English
The statement "'a' --> Gr. 'o' is incredible" is not correct; in fact it is rather
frequent. However, that does not mean that this rule applies in this case: oryza is not
from arici. Your derivation from Iranian is probably the right one.
Arici itself is probably a loanword from early Indo-Aryan *vrIjhi (p vrIhi). There are some
names for 'rye' in European languages which suggest a possible Indo-European connection:
Greek briza (from Thracian?), Lithuanian rugiai, German Roggen, Dutch rogge, English rye.
