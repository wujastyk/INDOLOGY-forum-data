Subject: The Great Tope of Manikyala

   I've not been keeping up with the literature on (buddhist) archaeology
   in Pakistan for the last fifteen years, but am still being haunted
   by an old question:

   What has become of the 'Great Tope' near the village of Manikyala,
   located to the south-east of Rawalpindi/Islamabad (33' 28", 75'15"),
   since it was "discovered" at the beginning of the last century?

   I think a remark of Debala Mitra (Buddhist Monuments, 1971) on
   the old finds in this stupa (coins of Kanishka and Huvishka), is the
   last information I have about it.

   A reasonable state of preservation of this stupa would be one the
   main reasons for an eventual trip to Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.

   I guess there may be more appropriate Lists or Groups for dropping
   my question. Most lists about Buddhisme however seem to be devoted
   more to spiritual matters than just old mounds of bricks.

   For any more recent information on this stupa, references to it,
   or suggestions for other platforms to put my question,
   I will be very grateful,

   Jaap Pranger

   The "Great Tope" was opened first by General Ventura
