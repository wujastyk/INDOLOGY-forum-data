I suppose, you know Garbe's and Finot's editions. In around 1900-1920
B. Laufer wrote several monographs on gems (and other articles of
ancient international trade) using Chinese, Greek and Latin, Indian
and Arabic sources.
My book, K. Karttunen, India and the Hellenistic world, Helsinki 1997
contains some further references and discusses the stones from the
viewpoint of Greek and Latin literature (p. 233-252). See also G.
Wojtilla, Indian precious stones in the ancient East and
West, Acta Orientalia 27, Budapest 1973, 211-224.
