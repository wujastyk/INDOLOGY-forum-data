Yiddish translation of Gita (?)
 Let me remind
Yes but Hebrew was ( and is ) a language which is deeply rooted in the
foundations of Jewish mind and  culture, being its very linguistical
archetype, intrinsically connected with its various expressions. Not so with
Yidish, which derives from a language with a largely different  set of
values.
Well in that case it's just your own problem.
