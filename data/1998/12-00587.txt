There is quite a bit of literature on this subject, and some have
attempted to link this Tamil homeland with the land of "Lemuria."
Lemuria is a name given to that submerged land that was supposedly
inhabited by, among other things, lemurs.  A great deal of "new age"
theories revolve around Lemuria and its counterpart Atlantis.
