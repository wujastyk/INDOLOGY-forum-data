I doubt very much that this is a valid method of interpreting the text of
the Mahabharata. Irony is a rhetorical device, and we may expect to find it
sometimes in the dialogues, which are often of a polemical character. But
does the narrator himself ever use irony in the narrative parts of the
story? Please give convincing examples! Heroic epithets out of context can
be explained as a feature of the formulaic style of (originally) oral
composition and not as examples of irony, I would say.

Best regards,
