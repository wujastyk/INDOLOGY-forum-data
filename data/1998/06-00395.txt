Inquiry: spoken Tamil grammar?
An American friend of mine (who speaks Japanese fluently) has been trying
with little success to find a grammar of SPOKEN Tamil. (None of the 10 or
so books he has procured provides paradigms for conjugation in Spoken
Tamil.) Any information would be greatly appreciated.
