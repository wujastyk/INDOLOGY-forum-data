One can question how these cultures are labelled "Aryan,"
which must mean they were IE speakers.  Since the cultural
complexes do not relate closely with historical Indo-Aryans
and they left no writing, then the basis seems biological.
However, we can certainly question whether the 'liberal'
interpretaton of Gimbutas' "steppe type" and [primitive]
'Mediterranean' as Aryan is correct.  There seems to be
a tendency to classify any skeleton that does not fit into
the "typical" Mongoloid pattern as Caucasoid. However, in
the above cases, the phenotypes are much closer to typical
Turco-Mongols or Dravidian/Australoids respectively than to
"typical" Caucasoids.
However, the important evidence of settlements built upon
the remains of destroyed Indus cities by chariot-equipped
armies remains lacking.  The Painted Grey Ware Culture, for
example, often cited as the best candidate for aryanhood
was almost entirely located outside of the IVC territority.
