Postscript Devanagari Font
Dear Indologists,
I was absent from this list for some time, so please excuse if I ask a
question recently asked: I am looking for a Postscript Devanagari
Font. Does anyone know of a good font? I would prefer a shareware-font,
but I am also able to buy one, if no good shareware-font is available.
Only it must be a postscript font and executable under different
programms. I know of Wikners TEX-Devanagari-Font, but I believe it is only
useful for TEX and not for other programms - or am I wrong in this?
I am looking forward to your help!
