    The pictures of KRSNArjunasaMvAda appear rather late in Indian art, it is
true. But does it mean that theism and bhakti are late phenomena in India, too?
By the way, KRSNa is historically THE FIRST of the Mbh personages to appear
in Indian art (Agathocles's coins and a terracotta from Sugh, both belonging
to the 2nd cent. BC). KRSNa then dominates in Hindu iconography of the KuSANa
period, and Govardhanadhara KRSNa theme is popular in sculpture of 4th-6th
AD (see V.P.Dwivedi. Mbh in Indian art. - In: Mahabharata: Myth and reality.
Differing Views. Delhi, 1976, pp. 126-134). Is not the bhakti cult of VAsudeva
evidenced in the same 2th century BC by the famous "Heliodoros" column? Is not
the theism of the GItA firmly rooted both in theistic tendencies of early
SAMkhya-Yoga and in theistic UpaniSads? Participants of this discussion are
probably right asserting that MASS bhakti cult of the Middle ages could
develop under some Buddhist or foreign influences. But this is not the case
with GItA's theism and bhakti.
        Best regards,
                                                Ya.V.
