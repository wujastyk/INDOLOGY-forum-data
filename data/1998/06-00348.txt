No; Hans Hock also asked me if we could somehow derive  all retroflexes and
alveolars [which do not occur word-initially= the basis of the hunch] from
sandhi of some liquid+dental. Only _t and .t are derivable in a few cases of
inflection and derivation by sandhi. What about l,.l, r,.z which also do not
occur word-initially? There is no way to derive them through sandhi. So
non-occurrence word-initially is only a phonetic constraint (the tongue-tip
can be raised for coronal articulation only after a syllabic segment) and
not reminiscent of a historical event.

My Hawaii paper, Patterns of sound change in Dravidian, is published in The
Yearbook of South Asian Languagea and Linguistics 1998 (ed. Rajendra Singh),
Sage, 1998. I have discussed some PD morphophonemics in it.

personal pronouns and kinship terms and did not find much support for a long
range genetic relationship. I believe that the time tested comparative
method will fail in establishing long range genetic relaionships, because
aspects of  diffusion from other families in contact cannot be accounted
for, as different from gentic phenomena. I have just started reading Bob
Dixn's new book The rise and fall of languages. He has some interesting
insights on this question. Bh.K.
