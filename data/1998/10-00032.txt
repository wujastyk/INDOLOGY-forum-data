translation in english requested.
hi all
I am working on the great poet KALIDASA and his
works in sanskrit.
Can anybody help in finding out the Translation for
his poetic work
'SYAMALA DANDAKA'.
I need a soft copy of it (or if it is available
on any web site that will be helpful)
thanks in advance.
krishna
