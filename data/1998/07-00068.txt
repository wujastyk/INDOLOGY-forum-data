tuebingen catalogue
To all South Asia Scholars,
we are happy to announce that our Online-Catalogue has an English
interface now. Our library is a university library with the special
collection of South Asian books and periodicals. The catalogue
contains the libraries' books from 1980 onwards as well as the
very old books from 1500-1850. We are continually trying to fill in
the gap by converting the pre-1980 titles into machine-readable form.
Here's the URL:
