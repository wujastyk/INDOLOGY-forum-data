Relationship Between Temple Architecture and Cosmology
Mani,
Can you please clarify the source of these rather
interesting specifics ?
Can you or someone else in the list point to me the earliest
sanskrit work that refers to kshIrAbdhi and its details
such as whether it is southern production or eastern
or Kashmirian production, when it was composed  etc.
Thanks
Selvaa

*Vishnu in Vaikuntha is said to be in a sitting pose, with one leg

*Typically, Vishnu is known in this form as parama-pada-nAtha.

*It is true, however, that Srirangam is known as bhUloka-vaikuNTha.
