arma-, armaka 'ruined site'
The text which Burrow translates here is not Rig-Veda but Taittiriya
Brahmana II, 4, 6, 8. He discusses it in 'On the significance of the term
_arma-, armaka-_ in early Sanskrit literature', in _Journal of Indian
History_ (University of Kerala), Vol 41 Part 1 (April 1963) pp. 159-66.
In this article he says that these words refer to ruined sites, and gives
occurrences of them from Rig-Veda Samhita to Panini. The commentaries on
Panini explain it as vinaSTagrAma or zUnyagrAmanivAsa. Burrow concludes (p.
166):  'They confirm the theory that it was in fact the Aryans who were
responsible for the overthrow of the Indus civilisation, they show that
for centuries the most important of these ruins were conspicuous features
of the countryside and they supply interesting information about the
location of some of them.'
