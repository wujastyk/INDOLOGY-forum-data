How is this:
AAvazyaka-cuurNi for the illustration of the term
utpattikii buddhi we read
how a young monk defeats a female wandering
ascetic, after she had made the proclamation:
Whatever someone does, I also can do it (jo jaM
karei taM mae kaayavvaM).
The young monk, creating a lotus (in the sand)
with his urin, won the contest.
 (teNa [khuDDaga] saagaariyaM daaiuuNa kaaiyaae
paumaM lihiyaM. saa na tarai. jiyaa)
