Brhadaranyaka Upanisad III. ii .12
What disappears after final liberation is the association of an
individual's soul with
a name and form (this is how I read Mundaka 3.2.8; Mundaka 3.2.11 states
that this truth was declared by the seer Angiras), but a name can not
disappear if sound is taken to be
eternal and uncreate.
