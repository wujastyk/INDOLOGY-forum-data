Dear list members,

There is a new copyright law (HR2281) making its way through the U.S.
Congress that could make it illegal to share certain published materials
through the internet.  A strong opponent of this law is Pamela Samuelson, a
law professor at the University of California, Berkeley.  A conference on
these proposed changes will take place in UC, Berkeley, towards the end of
April, and there is a Web site for the conference that explains aspects of
the law.

For those interested, the url is:
