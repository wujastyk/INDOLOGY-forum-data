In telugu the word that is used is 'mEstrI'. The word is used to
indicate a person who is the leader of a group of labourers
who are engaged to do a particular job.(For example construction
job or quarrying etc.) The word appears to be derived most probably
from the word 'master' or 'mastery'. It is also used to indicate
an expert in a trade. Thus 'tApI mEstrI' stands for 'master mason'.
