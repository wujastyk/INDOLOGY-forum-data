Did you ever think about what we learned:
the most worst etymology of a word is the
derivation to a root
the best one in contrast is the similar derivation
of a second word

>Dear INDOLOGISTS,
>I have two questions for you:
>1. Is there a word/grammatical classification to
describe two separate
>Samskrt words which have the same meaning(paryAya
pada) and  the
>spellings are slight variants of each other? i.e.
pr`thvI and pr`ithivI
>mean "earth" and the spelling is slightly
different, but both are
>separate words.
>Other examples are : mukunda and mucukunda( both
mean "viSNu"),
>vasudhA and vasundharA( both mean "earth") and
probably zabarI and
>zaurI ( the lady who appears in the rAmAyaNa,
though I'm not sure if
>"zaurI" can mean "zabarI"). How have these words
been derived?( spelling
>is nearly the same but the words are treated  as
separate)
>
>2. Can anyone point me towards the
derivation/origins of the word "AI"(
>mother) in marATHI and assamese? The word AFAIK
does not exist in Hindi
>and Bengali( the languages spoken in between
Maharashtra and
>Assam) but is strangely present in these two
geographically
>discontinuous areas. Are there any other examples
of such words?
