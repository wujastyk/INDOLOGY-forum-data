Here you are right. 2 is not meant here as the exact passive copy of 1. In fact, your
sentence (2a) is a better example. In your example 2a, too, the locative phrase has been
moved to subject position.

This is not the point, as 1) is an active consturction in Tamil. I wrote in a shorter notation here to save time and space on the web, but as you see, the contrary became true. I shoud have said PAST-PNG, or PAST with person-number-gender agreement. It's an active past tense.

This is true. As you see in your example, ocean cannot be a subject in a passive construction. In Dutch, it seems to be possible, but on closer look the verb then has changed to a medium like one:

1) hij wandelt op de straat
he - walks - on - the - street
2) de straat wordt bewandeld
the - street - is - walked on

That `bewandeld' is not a simple perfect passive form of the active `wandelt' in 1) is seen in the alternative active construction of 1) without the preposition:

1b) hij bewandelt de straat
he - walks on - the - street
