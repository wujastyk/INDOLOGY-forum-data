what we would expect to find.  Quite a bit different from the Hun
comparison, where we can find nearly exact matches between the texts
and the archaeological evidence.
Another important question is whether the IE migration/invasion is
linked with a biological intrusion. Were the IE peoples physically
similar to ancient Persians.  A pertinent question considering
Kennedy's statement in _Eastern Anthropologist_ that no biological
"Aryan" series has been discovered at the ancient sites.
While I have no problem with a gradual diffusion of IE influence into
India, the chronology and the supposed Vedic=PGW that are so
popular now are full of problems.
