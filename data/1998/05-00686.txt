sarasvatI (etymology)
Miguel Carrasquer Vidal answer:
        Both.
        My research is mainly based on Greek files but Skr. saras (if
cognate) could suggest a greater extension. I'm not sure that the
opposition salted/sweet is the key and, when kRSNa evokes His preeminence
in all sort of things, He says (BhG X,24d = Mbh VI,32,24d): "sarasAm asmi
sAgaraH", implying that the ocean is a saras and, even, the better.
        Knowing if salt > sea or sea > salt is not clear but I could prefer
the second choice by the simple evidence that the salt comes from the sea.
This fact is perhaps sustained by the gender: hals "sea" is feminine, but
the salt is commonly masculine, frequently neutral as the fruit of a tree.
        An other puzzling fact is the Skr. lavaNa, perhaps a witness of the
same semantic shift if we think to Latin lavere, Greek loutron ...
        Probably a file to open again.
