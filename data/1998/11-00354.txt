  I was informed:
  "In earlier Sanskrit upon chanting mantrams, one has
  to say "Om" which means 'yes'. Only in the later
  times, tathaa takes its place." An example will be
  appreciated.

  Not only in archaic Tamil, even today "aamaam";
  It is just "Am" repeated twice "Am Am = yes, yes".

  Jaffna dialect of Tamil possesses many archaic
  features of Old Tamil. In YaazhppaaNam/Jaffna Tamil,
  people say 'Om' for 'yes' all the time.

  I think the praNavam's meaning as a+u+m was
  formulated later.
