Chin-sheng (688-740 AD), T'ang dynasty
I checked OCLC database with author as Wang Gang-wu or
Wang Gang Wu. Nothing shows up.
As a subject I get 3 titles: all unrelated to
Buddhism, T'ang dynasty etc.,
Can please Harbsmeier be asked to give
few titles?
More biblio info please.
Thanks,
N. Ganesan
My colleague C. Harbsmeier (sinologist), who happened to be in my room
when
your message came, suggests that you consult the publications of Wang
Gang-wu (former president of Hong Kong University) to find relevant
information about the author in question.
Best wishes
