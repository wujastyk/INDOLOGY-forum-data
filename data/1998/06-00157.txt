Dear Vidyasankar:
Thank you for this information, certainly relevant, and prompting me to ask
if there are any published commentaries on this ritual you mention.

>Note that in the annual upAkarma rituals (usually in the month of
>SrAvaNa), the new yajnopavIta is also first wrapped around the knees in
>the manner of the yoga-paTTa, before being worn over the shoulder. There
>may be other mantric associations with the manner of using the
>yoga-paTTa.
