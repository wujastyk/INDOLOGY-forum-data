Scenarios and percentages... Should RV be expected to contain
EVERYTHING as Subrahmanya had observed in another context?

George Thompson had observed earlier that, RV's 'internal'
philological evidence can be used as a touchstone for 'external' data.

Maybe, some rigour in methods should be discussed here, before
'fitting' RV texts and poesy with the 'external' evidence from other
disciplines such as archaeology, historical metallurgy or earth
sciences.

Take for example, the problem of 'locus' and the two sarasvati_s
scenario. Which sarasvati is referred to, in what context and what
time sequence (of, say, movement, if any, between haraqaiti and
dr.s.advati_-apaya_- sarasvati_) can be inferred from the texts?
