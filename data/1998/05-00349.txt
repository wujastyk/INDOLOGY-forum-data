Horses/Indus seals
Dr. Lars Fosse writes:
The bull is frequently represented in Indus seals. Does it
have anything to do with the Nandi vaahana of "Siva in later Hinduism?
Have seen in articles that "Siva is largely pre-vedic and
pre-Aryan.
Vedic folks sought many (100,000?) cows. Have seen that even the universe is
born out of a Cow. gOdaana is important in dharmasaastras. Is there any link of
cows largely, but NOT bulls, to vedic material?
Thoughts, corrections welcome.
