pot-shaped lamp in temples supported on a stand
Hi,
Tamil lexicon has this entry:
ce_n-ai-k-ka_l stand of a pot-shaped lamp used in temples.
Can someone on the list provide more information on this?
Particularly intriguing is the prefix ce_n-ai.
s'en is a support for vine, pergola (Khotanese Iranian)
Regards,
k.
