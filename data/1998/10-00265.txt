Tantric siddhas - Mina
Dear indologists,
is there anyone who could give me information about the relationship of the siddhas as mentioned at the beginnig of the Hatha-yoga-pradipika and the 84 mahasiddhas of the Vajrayana tradition? I am especially interested in Mina - is it true, that he could be related to Matsyendra and Minapa?
 Is there a serious book dealing with the subject?
 Which other lists / sanskrit manuscripts is he included?
Thanks   Tibor Kov?cs
