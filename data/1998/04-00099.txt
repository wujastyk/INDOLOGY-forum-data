Betreff: RGVedic AryAs
possibilities re: the word AryA
all know for ages.
found in which AryAs were also
'Scientific Americans'.  Afterall
which missed Industrial
undermanagement. US is
patents issued/pending.
Java is today.  I can not
and left all other tribes
Vivekananda.  A literature as vast as
(not including other ancillary
Vedas) can not be a small
safely by just one tribe.  If
number of tribes fighting
it.  So AryAs and dAsyus,
possibly many other tribes who hated
knowledge.  Even purANAs say
like US.
Hindus had compiled all that
preserved the different views.
then we must also assume
in RGVeda.  Ignoring other
AryAs &c are not any historical
historic people, but authors
compose their theology.
India that mentions AryAs?
