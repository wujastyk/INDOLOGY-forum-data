Subject: Query: 11th World Sanskrit Congress in Turin?
Message-ID: <161227040240.23782.3711665019936706807.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I have had a message from Prof. Bhate in Pune asking whether I know
anything about the 11th World Sanskrit Congress, which she says is to be
held in Turin. I have not heard anything about this; there aren't any
announcements on the Indology home page, and I can't find any reference in
recent discussion either.

Can anyone help?
