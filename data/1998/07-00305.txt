As far as I know (I'm not sure about Edinburgh), the only University in
the UK to offer a four-year course is Cambridge. You can get some basic
information off the web page (www.oriental.cam.ac.uk): the course covers a
large range of different types of literature, and involves study of
background culture as well. It can be combined with Hindi if wished, but
is more usually done by itself.
