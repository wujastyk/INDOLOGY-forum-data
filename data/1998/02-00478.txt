The reason the TrueType font differs from the METAFONT is because certain
character positions are rejected or reserved in Windows, so any character
appearing in that position will appear empty. Tom Ridgeway, who made the
WNRI TrueType and Postscript fonts, made copies of certain characters in
duplicate positions to account for this behavior of Windows. These WNRI
fonts really need to be revamped.

Here's another suggestion: Move completely over to TeX and your problems
will be solved! Ask anyone... :-P
