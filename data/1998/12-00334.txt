don't like this theory and for what reason. I could make a similar
unsupported statement that theory 2 is popular among "many" "xyz" (where
both "many" and "xyz" are undefined or vaguely defined) because it
justifies a territorial claim on Pakistan.

Of course, I am using a and b above only for illustration. Seriously, I
am sure it would be instructive to study the political dynamics of the
popularity of various alternative speculations on the "indo-aryan"
origins. But simply speculating on those dynamics without bothering to
adduce any basis serves no purpose other than to add another (possibly
more palatable to some) political layer to the existing political
layers.
In short, Samar Abbas, if you don't have a political agenda here and you
are simply indulging in random speculations, I respectfully suggest you
are wasting your time. If you are actually a student of the politics of
origin theories, then again I hope you are able to substantiate your
claims more rigorously than you have done here.
