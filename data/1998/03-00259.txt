Indo-Aryan migration vs Indigenous origin - scholarly debate

Dear George,
I never asked for apologies and I certainly don't subscribe to the
theory that westerners are the source of all evils !
My posting - which does not appear to have been off the mark considering
the reactions - meant to sound out the experts on this list and to ask
for their views on the alleged Aryan migration/invasion into India
which, we were told until recently, destroyed the Indus civilization.
This seems to be disputed strongly nowadays, admittedly by writers such
as Frawley who may have some rather contemptuous views on the West
generally and Indology in particular.
In his recent posting, Krishna made a number of points to criticize the
book which I thought were quite good but just telling the Frawley-like
people to go to hell is unlikely to solve the REAL questions:
a) Was there an Aryan migration/invasion of India which destroyed the
Indus valley civilization ?
or
b) Is it a fairy tale concocted by certain scholars in the last century
and if so why ?
