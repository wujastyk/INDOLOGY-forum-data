Correction to smoking, seasoning and cooking in Dravidian
In my earlier posting, the discussion on DEDR listing of "pukai" should read
as given below.
DEDR 4235 shows "Ta. pukai smoke, mist, vapour, steam; (-v-, -nt-) to smoke
emit vapor or steam; (-pp-, -tt-) ?to cause to smoke?;.... pukAr ?mist, fog,
haze?.....Te, poga, pova smoke, fume; pogayu, povayu to smoke; pogucu, pogacu,
pogapu (K. also) pogapu to smoke, fumigate, fry, season with spices; pogapu,
pogupu, frying, seasoning with spices......" (DEDR has missed to include the
meaning seasoning for the Tamil entry.)
Please note the correction. Thanks.
