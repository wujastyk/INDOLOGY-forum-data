Saras... (Soma vessel)
Geldner's handy summary again which I could not do at home [snip]
5:> (I translate from the German and summarize:)
* pressing the soma on a stone with the help of another stone
(wooden) pressing boards >  (it sometimes seems that this pressed
fluid runs down directly into a >         watery vessel) << I may add
that Ahalya does all of this with >    just her teeth... and Indra
comes running >>
  and is cleansed of its filament remnants>  >   on this sieve, Soma
moves about in circles and flows down through it, >   with
'spouts/beams/rays' (Strahl = dhAra) into the large Soma >   vessel or
vessels  below it.
drinkable. >   Water is either poured into the vesel or it flows down
via the sieve
The RV soma vessels apparently were all made of wood; later, <<in the
"wood".
speak > about Soma running like rivers to the samudra ... not into
caves/holes....
look > for REAL survivals/matches, such as the system of weights...
When I.Mahadevan presented his paper in Tokyo, the discussions
included questions on establishing parallels with the pravargya
sa_magri_ replicas kept in Pune.
It is too tempting not to jump into this soma problem, briefly.
[Hopefully, Munshiram will bring out my mss. already announced in the
forthcoming publications list.]
RV is poetry par excellence with allegories, puns and metaphors.
An alternative metallurgical interpretation of soma is possible
(adding to the scores of flora-based decipherments compiled by Henry
Falk); to be cryptic:
*s'ulva connotes copper.
*ma_ks.ika_ connotes pyrites.
*ams'u connotes projecting sharp branches (this is how *a pyrite ore
block will look).
*the only process described in RV fits the process of reducing the ore
(purifying?) to produce potable (not drinkable!) somnakay (Gypsy) or
assem (Ancient Egyptian as reported  by Joseph Needham).
*Not to forget (1) the Tamil/Siddha alchemical tradition of
rasa-va_da; (2) links between Sarasvati river and gold; and (3) the
anecdotes of the golden fleece.
