Indo-Aryan migration vs Indigenous origin - scholarly debate
Charles Poncet says:
In this context does anybody have the adds of Dr Klaus Kostermaier of
UManitoba? IF so, with consensus may we invite him to take part in this
AIT/AMT debate? He was the academic who gave Messrs Kak,Feurstein
and Frawley a glowing review; this review is normally passed off by this
school as *proof* of it's mainstream acceptance.
  I'm sure we would all benefit from finding out why Dr Kostermaier says
what he says.....
