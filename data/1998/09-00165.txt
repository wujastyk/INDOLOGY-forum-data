CFP: Schools and Scholars section of IJHS
                                                           Call for Papers
_International Journal of Hindu Studies_ seeks contributions for a new
section of the journal devoted to Schools and Scholars. This section will
publish critical appreciations of major scholars and schools who have
contributed to the development of the field of Hinduism. Schools and
scholars considered under this rubric do not have to be religionist by
disciplinary affiliation; and we will publish commentaries both sympathetic
and sceptical.
Contributions submitted for this section of the journal will be evaluated
through the usual _International Journal of Hindu Studies_ double-blind,
peer reviews.
Completed manuscripts and inquiries about material for possible publication
should be send to the Editor:
