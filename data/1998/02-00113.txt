Shalom to all,
I would like to thank E. Harzer Clear and G. von Simson for referring me
to M. Mayrhofer's etimological dictionary.
Mayrhofer also reads Naciketas as "naci+ketas", like Chrpentier. But
unlike him, he relates the name to the root "cit" and knowlege, and says
nothing about Makaraketu, the epithet of Kamadeva.
Does anyone know about any text or commentary that connects Naciketas
with Kama, beside Charpentier's note in his translation of the Katha
Upanishad?

Thanks in advance for your help.
