Dear colleagues
I have been asked to make a presentation on  the  use of computers for
research in Indology in a multinational meet. I will be grateful
to you all for whatever information on this subject.Your ideas and
suggestions are also most welcome.Needless to say that I will be
consulting the Indology website for initial information.Thanks in advance.
