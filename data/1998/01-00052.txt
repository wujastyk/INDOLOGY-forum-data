Kuyava
        In relation to the discussion of Kuyava, a previous message
brought up the word kUyavasA.  I am not sure if the two words are related,
but certainly the latter expression has a parallel in the word sUyavasa
which is understood by Surya Kanta to mean "full of grass".  Related
expressions are sUyavasAd, sUyavasin, and sUyavasyu.  Most likely, the
personal name Kuyava is not related to either of these words.
