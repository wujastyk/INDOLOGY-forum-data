This is probably similar in spirit to the correlations that Indians are
so fond of. It goes back to upanishad days, e.g. idamdra, svam apiti
etc, and you will find such things not only in Sanskrit but almost every
other spoken language. I doubt if you will find much of a modern sense
of etymology in it.
