I can't claim to be a learned scholar on this, but this is my take.
The coexistence with worldly activities takes place, once you
do acts for the sake of doing and for the sake of achieving.
Achievements are external perceptions of your deeds, you not

He himself defines the stages of liberation in vivekacuDamaNi.
The aspiration of liberation is the last stage of a yogi's life.
All activities indeed cease at that time.
