AS far as I know, archaeological remains have been found of almost "Nordic"
looking people in Sinkiang (pl. correct me if I am wrong about the place).
The bodies are well preserved, and they should indicate that migrations of
Indo-European looking people took place. But, of course, the dead don't speak.

There is an Internet site about this, but I have lost the web-address. Sorry.

On the other hand, the horse-and-chariot concept may have passed through
non-Indo-European hands before reaching China. So we shan't know for sure.

Too bad.
