Indo-Aryan Invasion (proposal for virtual sattra)
I would like to suggest another paper appearing in the same volume as
Erodsy's (The Indo-Aryans of Ancient South Asia: Language, Material Culture
and Ethnicity). The paper is written by Michael Witzel and is called
"Rgvedic history: poets, chieftains and polities"). Then not only the
linguistic and the archaeological dimension would covered, but also the
historical.
Best regards,
