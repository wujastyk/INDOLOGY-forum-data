Horses and chariots again.

The attestation in a great number of IE languages points to a rather old
meaning "to take something (in a vehicle) somewhere" (terminative action),
which has become durative already in (late) Proto-IE and thus made an
s-aorist necessary (Vedic avaaT, subj. aor.  vakS-at; Greek (dial.)
eFekse, Latin vexi, etc.):
Present: Vedic vahati 'drives', Avest. vazaiti 'drives', Greek (dial.)
FeksetO 'must bring', Latin veho 'drive', Old Norse vega 'move, drive'
(plus engl. waggon, etc.), Lithuanian vez^u 'drive'. Old Church Slav.
vezo, (vesti) 'drive', Tocharian B wask, A wAsk 'to move, twitch' (new

Funerary rituals do not have a connection with local myths? E.g. what
about the injunction against cremation in Christian societies not so long
ago (since you need all of your bones to be resurrected)? Or the various
Hindu practices?
In myth you do not need *real live* persons. -- A transplant of sort -
by horse head - was certainly performed on the Sintastha man after his
death, just as it was done to Dadhyanc, to insure his (mythical) survival
after Indra had cut off his head.
The Sintastha man also has a flute next to his feet - it is in Yama's
realm that the flute is blown (RV/AV)....
Fine but, please, do not bury me with a horse head, though I, like
everybody, would like to speak/or to hear straight from the horse's
mouth...  especially if it is the secret of the (succesful) ritual, as in
the case of Dadhyanc AatharvaNa.
