Since tamil does not have a letter for 'd' seperately
muttusvAmi dIkSitar is alright. But what about muthusvAmi
dIkSitar? The word muddu or muttu stands for charming.
muddu paLani, muddu kumAra stand for charming child
subrahmanya. ( cf., 'muddukumAra jananIM' in "bhajarE
chitta bAlAmbikAm" in kalyANi)
Men of arms who are in the process of acquiring power usually do not
have much 'culture'. Usually culture comes much later when they settle
down. This is true whether the they are telugus or tamils.
Krishna and Godavari deltas were already in the hands of Vijayanagar
empire. These are richer than the Kaveri delta. Krishnadevaraya sent
Nagamanayaka to the south when the then pandya king sought his
assistance because of an usurper.
kSEtrajJa who is considered as erotic pada personified belongs to
this period. His sahityam is unequalled to this day. I do not know
what was the state of tamil padam at that time. But I think that
tamil padams had a new life after the kSEtrajJa. The great musicologist
vEnkatamakhi about whom the tamilians boast is in the court of
raghunAtha nAyaka.
The love of Nayak kings for telugu one may consider as love for the
mother tongue. But what about the unreserved patronage of maharastrian
kings of TanjAvur for telugu. This you cannot ascribe it to partiality to
the mother tongue. Sahaji's telugu writings attest to the beauty of
telugu as a language refined. ( Why even the great subrahmanya bhArati
gave his attestation to the sweetness of telugu).
Are the nAyak kings responsible for this decline of tamil literature
or the decline has already set in? If it has already set in,
making nAyak kings responsible for it is searching for scapegoats.
In telugu, kIrtanam was already there. As far as I know Bhadrachala
RAmadAs never visited tamil country to learn about kIrtanams.
