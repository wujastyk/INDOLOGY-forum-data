I am proud too that there are indologists who have the courage and
integrity to keep on open mind and re-visit the earlier hypotheses,
based on new 'data'. The progress we make in reaching the 'truth' will
be a lot faster if this method is used to restate the hypotheses in an
iterative exercise... There is, of course, the other problem of
'fairness'; this is perhaps related to a researcher's repertoire.
George Thompson has said it beautifully; if a discipline is alien, it
is better to keep silent. Something not always practised at times by
some.
