Author:        Chattopadhyaya, Debiprasad.
Title:         Lokayata; a study in ancient Indian
                  materialism.
Published:     [New Delhi] People's Pub. House [1959]
(2nd ed. 1968)
Just to add this, I didn't *recommend* the book I mentioned earlier at
all; I simply suggested that it *might* be of use to somebody who was
searching for Lokaayata-related materials. (Also, *that* book was
published after Franco's "perception and disbelief", so I was actually
curious how Franco could have referred to it, but that question seems to
be answered now.)
