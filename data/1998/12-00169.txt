Sanskrita font
The font developed by Rolf Koch <roheko at t-online.de> is a very
nice looking font and appears to follow phonetic principles.

<<Please have a look into the paper: Udayana and VAsavadattA according to
the Avazyaka tradition in INDOLOGICA TAURINENSIA vol. 21/22 (1995-96),
pp. 188-92. This devanagari print is based on my devanagari-ttf font. If
you like it, please contact me privately. It is free. Just copy the font
into the directory windows\fonts and find out the keyboard layout by
yourself.
