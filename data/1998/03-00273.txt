Indo-Aryan im/e-migration: Horse argument

        Perhaps a difference between knowing horses and having a cultur

material of the Scythian graves?
        This list is strictly comparable with the list of lions' remains in
Mycenian Greece: few artifacts, one or two teeth and bones. Archeologists'
opinion is that the lion was a rare imported prestige pet.
        The important use of eagles and bees in Napoleonian insigns don't
prove the 1800's French people was consecrated to the falconry and
beekeeping. Mr Subrahmania says the archeology is scientific: I agree, but
perhaps that's not true for the interpretation of archeology's results ;)
