Sarasvati (texts & arch.II)
But what about the Vedic hymns?  Supposedly these hearken back to
a time when little Indian influence had affected the language.
 Anyway, my point
Maybe not in the case of gradual demic diffusion.  However, a mass migration
of whole communities in wagons (and chariots?) from the Volga invading a
foreign land is something to sing about.
