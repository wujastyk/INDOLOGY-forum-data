     Is this different from what is given below? If so,
     I am very interested to know.
     BTW, I found a very matching theme in kaavyadarsha.
     Many thanks,

*Verse 47 of the Uttaramegha of the Meghaduuta reads as follows (apologies
*for not supplying the Sanskrit -- I do not have access to it at the moment;
*the translation is one that I did many years ago when studying Sanskrit

*specifically, it is set within the wider context of the torment of
*separation (viraha).
*"I embrace, o excellent one, the southern blowing Himaalayan breezes, which
*split at once the pods of the shoots of the Devadaaru pine trees and are
*redolent with their milky sap, thinking that they might well have touched
*your body earlier." Meghaduuta 2.47
