Indian art texts
Consider the following textx from Sitaram Bhartia Institute of Scientific
Research, 1101, New Delhi House, 27, Barakhamba Road, New Delhi  110001:
(a)  MAYAMATA, trans. by Bruno Dagens. 1985.
(b)  ARCHITECTURE IN THE AJITAGAMA AND IN THE RAURAVAGAMA (1984)
(c)  BIBLIOGRAPHY OF WORKS ON VASTUSASTRA (1986)
(a)  Still the best text is Stella Kramrisch.  THE HINDU TEMPLE. 2 vols.
Originally U. of Calcutta, now reprinted by Motilal Banarsidass.  Also, as I
had one of my art and architecture students do recently: a boolean search on
First Search using combinations such as architecture and India, temples and
India, festivals and temples, and word and/or subject searches such as
vastupurusa, vastushastra (vastusastra), etc.
