passive of causatives (moving IO to SU in Skt)

Another pair which ought to be good (as it is given as an example in

 raamo vedam adhyaapyate      'R. is taught the V.'
I hope there is no problem taking the accusative 'raamaM' as an *indirect*
objet of 'adhyaapayati'. The same could apply to the first pair since (as
far as I know) a construction with double accusative is in principle
possible for 'darzayati' and it becomes a matter of whether you wish to
see the passive sentence as the passive counterpart of the double accusative
construction or of the accusative and dative construction like I do above.
(Note: indirect object in the genitive also possible)
Btw, why Rama and Nala? Isn't it supposed to be Rama and Krishna? :-)
Also why John and Mary in the Japanese example???
