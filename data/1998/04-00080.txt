Brilliantly misplaced emotions of Prof Thillaud!!
I am no authority in any language including sanskrit or even my own mother
tongue Telugu.  I have no business to judge any language.
I am sorry I did not explain myself clearly.  My mention of India banishing
the use of the word 'untouchables' is a parallel to the banishing of the 'N'
word for African Americans.  Let any newspaer use that word today, and its
offices will be sued for billions of dollars.  (I agree that the use of the
word 'banish' is not scholarly.  It was not 'banish', the right word must be
'politicaly incorrect'.).
India has its right to discard words that do not suit its culture.  We will
mend ours and request others' language if necessary.
Prof Anil, do you still see 'extremism' in my words?
Regards,
Bhadraiah Mallampalli
