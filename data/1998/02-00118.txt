Origin of Dravidian languages
You must avoid one pitfall; the earliest available written record has
nothing to do with the branching and subgrouping of languages. Tamil,
Malayalam, Kannada, Tulu (?), Kodagu, Toda, Kota, Irula, etc. belong to one
subgroup which I call South Dravidian I; Telugu, Gondi, Konda, Kui, Kuvi,
Pengo, Manda, etc. belong to another subgroup I call South Dravidian II (or
South-Central Dravidian). Although  the literary language Telugu has a later
written record than Ta.Ka., (there is evidence of loss of earlier
literature, perhaps Jaina works in Telugu), its branching off from SDI goes
back to at least one millennium BC. Both SDI and SDII go back to an
undivided period of say 10-11th century BC. The rationale of this can be
found in several of my papers, particularly my review of Zvelebil's 1970
book in Lingua in 1974 and my article on Areal and lexical diffusion of
sound change in the journal Language (1978). Bh.K.
