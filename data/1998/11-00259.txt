Horses and chariots again.

I always have problems understanding how nomads in a treeless steppe can
1. find trees with which to create chariots
2. create smelting ovens, make bronze/iron, make tools with which to
create wooden planks, spokes, axles etc
Nomads in history have usually had a symbiotic relationship with
settled peoples. They provide cheese, milk, meat and buy the rest
from settled peoples. What makes it so difficult to believe that the
settled peoples built wagons especially constructed for steppe
nomads?
This is standard reasoning it goes like this:
1. You find Greek vases etc in Spain, Italy etc. Conclusion: Greeks
colonized this place.
2. YOu find Phoenician materials in Greece. Conclusion: Greeks traded
with Phoenicians.
I don't see any reason to believe that "Scythian" treasures were built
by Scythians, any more than nomad carts were build by nomads. One has to
believe that the technology has to be available to the nomads before one
can believe that is true.
