The stuatus of puur is controversial. It seems to have cognates outside

uur is unlikley to be of IE origin.
There is another problem in language contact situations: The meaning of
similar sounding words in different langauges can be influnced by one
another. This is why ``this in IA and Dravidian. so IA borrowed it
from Dravidian'' are too facile. This is precisely what the problem is in
discussions of retroflexion. I will expand on this when I get time,
may be tomorrow.
