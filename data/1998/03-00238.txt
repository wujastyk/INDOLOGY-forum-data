Hello
Dear Dr. Houben
I gave  several references under the heading "Re: Indo-Aryan invasion"
dated 3 mar 1998 in Indology. Pl. sift thru' them.
Some of them will be very relevant, I hope.
The subgroups were a) language change b) place names
c) substratum theory d) retroflexion.
For example:
what about
a) von Munkwitz-Smith, J. C.
Substratum influence in Indo-Aryan grammar,
PhD thesis, 1995, U. Minnesota.
Regards
N. Ganesan
