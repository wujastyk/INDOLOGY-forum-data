I didn't see the report but most probably you are refering to the famous
Akhal Teke horses, the *blood sweating* or *heavenly* horses adored by
the Chinese. There should be a vast literature on them. A short article
is available online at: http://www.silk-road.com/artl/maslow.shtml
There is even an *akhal-teke-network* on the web ;)
