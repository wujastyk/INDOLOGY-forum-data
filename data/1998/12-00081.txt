Is the Aryan Invasion a Myth?

If the Sintashta remains were indeed chariots, then that is a valid

This seems to presuppose (the word "added") that the Sintashta
"chariots" were derived from the Near Eastern ones.
However, what if the Near Eastern ones were developed from Sintashta?
That would mean reducing the number of excess spokes (streamlining?),
producing less weight, work and waste.
