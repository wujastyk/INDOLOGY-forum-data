It's not Indian and not in Sanskrit, but there is a story involving the cat
as a byword for greed in the Masnavi of Jalal al-Din Rumi, translated by
R.A. Nicholson (London:1924-40).  There is a short Urdu version on pp.
42-45 of Urdu:Readings in Literary Urdu Prose by G.C. Narang (University of
Wisconsin, Madison:1968).
