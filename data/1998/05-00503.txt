centuries before this era.  From this we are attempting to
extrapolate on events of anywhere from 1,500 BCE to 3,000+ BCE
using mainly text interpretation..

For example, our belief that the supposed "Vedic" peoples used horses
is based entirely on the Vedic texts. Since we do know the dating of
the entire corpus for sure,  how can we make any theories using these
texts?  Is the use of the Vedas as historical sources even valid?

ps -- regarding the use of saagara for lakes, doesn't this
have a long tradition in the literature?  Maybe I'm thinking of
something else, but I'll investigate.
