He certainly does not make that clear when he states "nowhere

Trying to pinpoint bias in linguistics work is a bit more difficult,
especially when this is done in a more subtle manner.  Yet one can still
find prima facie bias in various theories out there.  The idea of what
I call the "Mt. Ararat" origin of languages as postulated in various
circles is one example.  When linguistics mysteriously backs
up easily refutable genetic and anthropological theories, one has to be
very suspicious.
Also, it is more an idea of Western outlook altogether.  If there is a
tendency in academia to see Western culture as superior and central, how
can we trust any segment of it to be totally free of that bias?
Having done personal research into eugenics, I cannot agree.  While some
segments of the Europe did apply eugenics to inferior members of their
own race, at the same time they looked as other races as being entirely
inferior.  In fact, racial intermixture was often seen as a cause for
"bad genes" in the white race.
The situation in the Northern European countries was also very much
different than that in the rest of Europe which was decidely pro-natal
when it came to Europeans. However, eugenics was seen as a viable
solution for peoples of color.
If you read eugenics literature closely, you will find that there is a
strong bias toward racial genetic inferiority/superiority.
