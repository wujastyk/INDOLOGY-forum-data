Uttara Kuru
Greetings,
Does anyone here have opinions on the location of Uttara Kuru?
Please give your proposed boundaries and why you think that
way.  I'm interested mainly in theories placing it somewhere near
the subcontinent and not in Siberia, the North Pole or the Western
hemisphere.  Respond to the list or by email.
Thanks in advance,
Paul Kekai Manansala
