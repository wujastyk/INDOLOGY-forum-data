Subject: ASCII-ization of Dravidian sounds.
Message-ID: <161227036592.23782.6795445329267685446.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear Indologists,

I need to cite some proto-Dravidian and Dravidian forms in an email, but am
at a loss as to transcription.  Is there any agreed-upon rendition of such
sounds as {_r, _l, _n} with underscore -- apart from the kludge I used just
now?

Please "Cc:" my own address bpj at netg.se, since I only get the list in index
form (have to call long distance to download mail!)

Sarvamangalam,
