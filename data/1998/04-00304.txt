According to the mythological explanation of the story, the Earth needed to
get rid of many kSatriyas in order to lighten her burden, so the gods
incarnated for that purpose. It was all divinely ordained.
In KRSNa's words (to Arjuna):
Conquer your enemies... I have [already] killed them long ago.  Be the mere
instrument...!   BhG 11.33.
