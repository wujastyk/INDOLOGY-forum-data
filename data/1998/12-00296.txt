Since the time I mentioned Dr. Ambedkar's writings, I have come across a book,
"Indigenous Indians: Agastya to Ambedkar" by Koenraad Elst, first published in
1993 by Voice of India. This is a pro-Indigenous Aryan viewpoint. Has anybody
reviewed this work? There is a chapter called "Dr. Ambedkar: A True Aryan".
