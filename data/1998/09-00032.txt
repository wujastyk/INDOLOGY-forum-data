Dhvanyaaloka quote
The DhvanyAloka of Aanandavardhana with the Locana of Abhinavagupta,
Harvard univ. press, 1990, p. 343 gives
2.27f
"Anandavardhana: An example of the poetic suggestion of fancy
(utprek.saadhvani) is this:
       In spring the Malabar wind,
       swollen by the breathing of snakes
       that encircle sandalwood trees,
       makes travelors swoon.
For in this example the capacity of the Malabar wind to cause
travelors to swoon in spring is [actually] due to its stimulation
of love. But this capacity is fancied (utprek.sita) to be due to
the swelling of the wind by the poisonous breath of snakes wrapped
around the sandalwood trees [of Malabar]."
Can someone please give the sanskrit original? Is this
poem by Anandavardhana himself or a different author/work or
anonymous?
The Malaya breeze occuring in sanskrit poems especially
in love situations anywhere will be appreciated.
Does Kalidasa or Subhaa.sitaratnako.sa use Malaya breeze
in general love descriptions or in more specific vipralambha
situations? I found two more instances: Da.n.din and Jayadeva.
With kind regards,
N. Ganesan
