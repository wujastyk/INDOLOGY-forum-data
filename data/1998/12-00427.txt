Indian children born abroad -- RSS and Vivekananda
This thread on  RSS and counter-RSS has little to do with Indology as
perceived in this forum.  Any scholarship and debate emanating
from such groups are necessarily biased.  If any one has studied
the Hindu non-vedic literature (Srimad Bhagavatam and other puranas)
some further light on migration and geography might evolve.
Thank you for your non-indulgence..
