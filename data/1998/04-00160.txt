navagraha worshipped as deities
The following is a beautiful poem from
Tevaram, traditionally sung at Saiva Vellala
homes of Tamil Nadu at auspicious occasions.
I have heard it as a child from the
charming voice of Shanmuga Diikshitar
of Perur, Coimbatore, in cousins' weddings,
grahashaanti homam at home etc.,
Seeks Siva's protection from planets' ill-effects
if any.
I request Dr. Jayabarathi to translate this, please.

Pre-seventh century prayers to planets are there
in Puranaanuuru, ParipaaDal, Silambu etc., They occur not as
navagraha prayers, but to individual planets
in several occasions.
I will post them when I find time.
