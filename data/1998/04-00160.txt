The following is a beautiful poem from
Tevaram, traditionally sung at Saiva Vellala
homes of Tamil Nadu at auspicious occasions.

I have heard it as a child from the
charming voice of Shanmuga Diikshitar
of Perur, Coimbatore, in cousins' weddings,
grahashaanti homam at home etc.,

Seeks Siva's protection from planets' ill-effects
if any.

I request Dr. Jayabarathi to translate this, please.

                         - campantar (early 7th century)

Pre-seventh century prayers to planets are there
in Puranaanuuru, ParipaaDal, Silambu etc., They occur not as
navagraha prayers, but to individual planets
in several occasions.

I will post them when I find time.
