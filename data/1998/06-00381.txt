Subject: Feedback on CSX+
Message-ID: <161227040244.23782.7915608039518811294.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

A couple of weeks ago I posted details of a proposed new encoding, CSX+,
based on and almost wholly compatible with CSX, and requested feedback. I
have received a number of comments, which I summarise below, together with
my responses.  Two of them concern bad-mannered behaviour on the part of
this or that specific piece of software. My overall feeling here is that
it would not be wise to take too much notice of such problems, so long as
they are relatively minor: if we do, (a) we may introduce
incompatibilities, (b) we may fail to include all the characters we want.
Further, (c) future releases of the same programs may anyway behave
differently (for better or for even worse).

(1) B.Philip Jonsson pointed out that y-dieresis is in fact used in
Afrikaans, and John Clews added that it is "used in French, and very
frequently in Belgium". However, neither they nor anyone else suggested
that it is worth retaining it in CSX+, and I continue to propose that it
should be eliminated in favour of something more generally useful for
Indologists.

(2) Birgit Kellner remarked that (Japanese versions of) Word for Windows
assume that character 150 is a dash, and freely introduce line-breaks
after it. In CSX and CSX+ the character in question is u-circumflex; my
hope would be that this is sufficiently rarely used for the problem to be
marginal. (I have not heard of any complaints from existing CSX users.)

(3) Anthony Stone reported that WordPerfect 6.1 for Windows replaces
character 171 (a-macron-tilde) by left guillemot and character 187
(currently r-underdieresis) by right guiullemot. (The guillemots are, I
think, used in WP's "reveal codes" mode.) He himself added that WP is
anyway less than ideal for other reasons for dealing with Indological-type
material; the two characters affected are relatively uncommon ones and I
propose to leave them where they are (but see next paragraph).

A change has been made in the draft standard for transliteration of Indian
languages: it is proposed to drop r-underdieresis in favour of l-underbar.
l-underbar already exists in CSX and CSX+ (character 215), so the
elimination of r-underdieresis frees up one more slot (187). I propose to
devote that slot to R-underring, which will be needed by Sanskritists
using the standard transliteration.

I am pleased -- and surprised -- to find that CSX+ now contains capital
versions of all the characters that are at all likely to require them. At
least, I *think* it does!

A revised definition file for the whole CSX+ encoding is attached. I shall
allow a few days for final comments to come in; after that a set of fonts
implementing the new encoding will be built, and an announcement will
appear on both the Indology and Conv-dev mailing lists.

# CSX+ encoding for mkt1font and vpl2vpl
#
# Enhanced version of CSX (Classical Sanskrit eXtended encoding)
# for the representation of Indian languages in Roman script
#
# CSX+ aims to be downward compatible with CSX, save for moving aacute
# away from the slot (decimal 160) used as non-breaking space on PCs.
# It also seeks to implement the (draft) ISO/TC46/SC2 standard, while
# retaining a useful set of European accented characters and adding
# dashes and directional double quotes.
