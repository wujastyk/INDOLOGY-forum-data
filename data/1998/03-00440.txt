Rig Vedic Racism
Lars Martin answer:
Dear Lars,
        I agree. I was simplifying. Perhaps this modern sense begins with
the colonization of Africa and America and the "soul problem". But that was
just a christian racism and I suppose Mendel's theories giving firstly a
scientific approach, alas used later as a pseudo-scientific justification
to various horrors :(
