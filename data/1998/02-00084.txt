Hultzsch's translation was published in 1925.  It might be interesting to
see whether A. Cunningham's earlier version (1877) and other early
translations used the word "curry"--I don't have a copy at hand.  But in
any case I would assume that
"curry" was widely current in Anglo-Indian use by Cunningham's time.

The "major rock edicts" were recorded at (at least) nine different places
around
India (at latest count); the version I cited is from Girnar (near
Junagadh, Gujarat) [This is meant to also answer J. Thakur's earlier
question about Girnar.]  But the original text was presumably composed in
the capital,
namely Pataliputra (modern Patna) in Magadha (=Bihar); so you are right to
think that the usage in question is essentially "northern."
