Hello everyone,

The new discussion on this topic seems to be more informed and
interdisciplinary.  I appreciate the efforts.

The study of migrations of people is Anthropology.  Ideas from various other
disciplines such as linguistics, geology, history, archaelogy may be used in
the discussion, but the last opinion (if not a decision) at any point of time
must always be reserved for academic anthropologists.  Are there any on this
list?

Any interpretive effort involves changing the model to suit the facts, instead
of selectively presenting the facts to suit the model of one's liking!

All the best.
