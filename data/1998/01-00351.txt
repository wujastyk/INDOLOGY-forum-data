The Cat
Patrick Olivelle's new book _The Pa?catantra: the book of India's folk
wisdom_ (OUP, 1997, ISBN 0-19-283299-9) has a nice section in the preface
where he discusses the traditional Indian/Sanskritic attitudes to various
animals (xxii-xxv).   Of the cat he says,
Cat: (domestic/wild) useful in catching mice....  Cats are cunning, with a
calm and ascetic appearance hiding their murderous intentions.... 
All the best,
Dominik
