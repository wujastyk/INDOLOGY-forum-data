Since there seems to be so much talk of scholarship or lack of it - 
there is a interesting new book "The Footnote - A Curious History" by 
Anthony Grafton. The book is illuminating and humorous.

The Footnote - A Curious History" by Anthony Grafton
Published by Harvard Univ Press       ISBN: 0674902157

The Footnote is described as -.... "The weapon of pedants, the scourge of
undergraduates, the b?te noire of the ?new? liberated scholar: the lowly
footnote emerges in this book as a singular resource with a surprising
history that says volumes about the evolution of modern scholarship."

The footnote has indeed played an important part in Indological scholarship
as well for eg: anaasa
