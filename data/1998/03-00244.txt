Since there seems to be so much talk of scholarship or lack of it - 
there is a interesting new book "The Footnote - A Curious History" by

The Footnote is described as -.... "The weapon of pedants, the scourge of

footnote emerges in this book as a singular resource with a surprising
history that says volumes about the evolution of modern scholarship."
The footnote has indeed played an important part in Indological scholarship
