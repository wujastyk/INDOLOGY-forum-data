         I've heard that 'aayiram' (meaning thousand in tamil) is a
         borrowing, presumably from skt.(sahasra). Can someone point to
         the arguments for this ? The Tamil word for hundred is
         nURu and, as I understand it, it comes from the verb 'nURuthal'
         (imperative/infinitive verb 'nURu')
         meaning 'to split into many parts'. A  related word is 'noRungu'
         (=crush).
         Semantically it is 'split > small > many'.
         Similarly the word 'aayiram', as I understand it, comes from the
         verbal root' 'aaythal' ( imperative/infinitive verb 'aay').
         Even today it is used in the sense of 'minutely split/separate'
         by those who work in the kitchen when they are preparing
         'keerai' (indian spinach or greens). The standard expression is
         'keerai aaythal'. Or when they are separating tiny stones from the
         rice etc. The standard expression is 'aayntu kodu'. The word
         'aayiram' is semantically almost identical to
         the word 'nURu' for hundred. 'Minutely split/separate > many'.

         Similarly I don't know how the word ENi = ladder is shown
         to be a loan word.  I wonder what the arguments are ?


@that R > r led later to some r's being represented as R. Hypercorrect forms
@are generally less systematic and give the impression of a reversal of sound
@change.

@mataca:nai is clearly a hyperstandard writing. If it was a sound change it

@The above with -c- are hypercorrect forms. If y became c why not vasal and
@vasil.

@What you say proves my point.


    How ?

@
@
@>The placement of DEDR 5259 Ta. vayiRu belly with an implied *-y- seems to be
@
@>correct even though Kannada has basiR. Colloquial Tamil has forms like vakuRu,
@>vavuRu, but no vacuRu.

     Palaniappan, I've come across both forms 'vasuru paciccaa thaana varuvaan'
     and 'vavuru paciccaa thaanE varuvaan' ( literally 'if stomach feels
     hunger, he will come'). The 'u' in 'vasuru' is short
     and it is difficult to say whether it is 'i' or 'u', as heard.
     The word 'vaasal' (entrance) is a modification of 'vaayil'. Strict
     transformation would lead to 'vaasil', but it is not uncommon.
     For example (1) payiRu becomes pasaRu (= a lentil),
     (2) mayiRu becomes 'masuru' (hair).
     etc.
     The transformation is y > s - as is well known in
     Tamil. What is the best source for the arguments of
     K's theory of 'hypercorrection' ?
@
@No. -c- is older as I said earlier. Konda and other SCD languages preserve
@the s form, Konda vasking(velar nasal)'entrails'. You seem to think that the
@oldest forms are only foound in Tamil in every respect. What is your basis
@for taking -y- in vayiRu as older? what am I doing again; take a lsesson on
@comparative Drav phonology? Who cares? Linguistics is not a layman's hobby.

    Palaniappan and Gansesan have been making excellent and detailed comments,
    and I'm really suprised at Prof. Krishnamurti's unwarranted remarks to
    their postings in this listserv.

    What is the basis for taking the Konda example as older ('preserve') ?

    Thanks

    P.S. (1) I'm very glad to see that Palaniappan and Ganesan are recording
         their thoughts here and I'm sure they will be useful to many
         sincere researchers.

         (2) I wonder whether anyone else can comment on Palaniappan's
         observation about omission of Velu Pillai's work.
