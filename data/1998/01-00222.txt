Thanks to Mr. Behr for the website about Xinjiang mummies.

Geographically, Tajikistan and Southern TianShan mountains are very
close to India. Tajikistan is just north of Kashmir.
Only the state of Kashmir lies between Punjab/Haryana and Tajikistan (a very
thin
slice of Afghanistan juts in).
The Tajikistan/Western China region is expected to be a archeologists paradise.
There is a possibility that older archeological sites may also be found.

It has been found that there was Indian influence(Buddhist) in this area. There
is also a possibility that there could have been pre-buddhist influence.

>>ps: No link _whatsoever_ with Uttarakuru
The link with uttara kuru cannot be summarily dismissed as it fits geographical
description. Only future archeological findings can confirm or dismiss it.

Also, on surfing the websites of the "Silk Road Foundation" and others, I found
that there is hardly any representation from scholars representing the Indian
point of view. This is important because the region is so close to the
Indus/Saraswati region.
Without proper representation of scholars from the Indian perspective there
is a possibility that collected data can be retrofitted to preexisting
notions rather than causing a reevaluation.
