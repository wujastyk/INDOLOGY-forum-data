religions and development of belief systems that emphasized tolerance
and acceptance. This is true for Hinduism, Islam, Christianity and other
religions to varying degrees.

        The best example of this is the Bhakti movement with
Meera Bai, Ramanuja, Kabir, Chaitanya Prabhu, and many others who
attempted to revive certain sectarian beliefs. The Bhakti movement also
assisted people in developing the notion of devotion and pleasure so one
may overcome cynicism and hardship of the religious wars that was going

at that time. This is not unlike the gospel music developed among the
Blacks in the United States that was devotional, entertaining,
pleasure-centered but was also a way of coping with slavery.
