In connection with this question, it would be useful to mention that the
proceedings of the 1996 Michigan-Lausanne International Seminar on the
theme "Aryan and Non-Aryan in South Asia: Evidence, Interpretation, and
Ideology" are close to being published.  The camera-ready copy is all set
to go to the printer, and we expect the book to be out in the next few
months.  It should provide a state-of-the-art discussion on a number of
related topics.
