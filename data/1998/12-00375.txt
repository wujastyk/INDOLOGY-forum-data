Indian children born abroad -- some (more) clarifications

On the VHP in the USA (and how it cultivates an image that in some ways
is quite different from that in India) see Arvind Rajagopal, "Expatriate

Since this is the _Indology_ List, we naturally discuss matters relating
to India and Indians, and from time to time also to expatriate Indians;
but Partha Banerjee has a point: this is _not_ merely a problem for NRIs
in the US (and so it is not really an Indological matter, though some
details may be of Indological interest). Basically similar, though
perhaps less poignant examples of frantic identity searches and
assertions can be given from European immigrant groups in North America
(see, for example, the support for the IRA among ethnically Irish groups
in the US).
