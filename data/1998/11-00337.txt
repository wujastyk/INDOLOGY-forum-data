Dear colleagues

 During the days I have not opened my e-mail the questions seems to
have moved beyond European stages, but perhaps an answer to the
original question is still in place. To make the post not too long, I
just list those cases I know of, without adding information about
theatres, directors etc. I am certain that even these are but a
small part of actual cases.

English
1899 ZakuntalA, Monier Williams' translation (1855) staged in London.
1912 same, in Cambridge, by Indian students.
1913 same, in London.
1924 MRcchakaTika, in New York, directed by Morgan and Irene Lewisohn
(famous).

German
1820 a stage version of the ZakuntalA by W. Gerhard published. I do
not know, whther it was actually staged.

published. It was staged several times in different parts of Germany
(e.g. Breslau).
