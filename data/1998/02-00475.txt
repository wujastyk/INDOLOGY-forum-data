CSX fonts
Hi,
Thanks  to all for your help with my problem.
Although I have solved it to my satisfaction, there are still a couple of
things I don't understand; I downloaded the Times-CSX font as suggested, and
it almost works with the Harvard Rigveda, except that the acute-e appears to
be missing. How come these fonts appear to have characters missing?
The solution in the end was to use the Washington Indic truetype font as a
screen font, and then compile the document in TeX using the Washington Indic
PK font. Surprisingly the two fonts are coded slightly differently; the
a-acute is in a different place. I simply programmed a macro in my text
editor to do a search and replace before I compile the TeX file, and another
afterwards. I will definitely have a look at the alternative TeX fonts you
suggested, although I've never used .vf fonts before; is there anything  I
should know before I start?
Thanks again,
Daniel Baum
