Oriya-TeX (fwd)
Re: Oriya-TeX
Hi Dominik,
This morning I've send Malayalam-TeX to the CTAN archive [i.e.,
ftp://ftp.tex.ac.uk], so it will be available soon in the directory
"languages".
New in this package:
- changed transcription scheme
- metafont code now included
- status changed to freeware (but I retain the copyright)
- various minor fixes and updates
The fonts have changed, so existing .pk and .tfm files should be
all replaced.
[...]
best wishes,
Jeroen Hellingman
