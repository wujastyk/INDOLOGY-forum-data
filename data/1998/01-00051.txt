Help with a sentence?
You know dear Jakob,
a lok. abs. is not very fair (since here you get
your subject: but what would be the subject in the
sentence you mentioned firstly, if you disconnect
sva from kaH: svayoor ...... zakyate to handle as
a separate sentence, how to translate this? In my
opinion there is no sense - it could be with sense
if there is like in the Jainprakrit also something
as a gen. abs. = meaning of lok. abs.), but I give
myself being overpowered (geschlagen). 1 point for
you. Let us return to your first question: do you
accept my advice for taking sva as a reflexiv
pronomina or not? If not: What will be your final
translation? In any way I am surprised that this
special point raised such a discussion it should
really be mentioned in the Sanskrit Grammars or
not?
You asked for help on your sentence, I sent you my
opinion. I myself have no more questions. But let
me win the next point, please.
