It is not clear that the IVC people "invented" the swastika. They have
certainly used it.

It would appear that this symbol was already known to the
Proto-Elamite cultures. Also, in the course of discussion of their
art, at least one writer  has speculated that this symbol is an
abstraction of a kneeling adorant with outstretched hand(s).

I do not have the reference off the top of my head but you can consult
with profit Harappan Civilization: A Contemporary Perspective, ed. G.
Possehl.

Thanks and Warm Regards.
