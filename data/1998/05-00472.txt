South India geography

<<I am reading a small poem in which a number of south Indian place
names are given. Where are the following places? Could some list member
give corresponding modern names?>>
1. mahAsurAlaya (in Kerala) - is this Sucindram?
It seems to me that this place(since there is reference to kEraLa) would
be more some place that is connected to bAli who was "Conquered" by
vAmana....
  ISn't this tiruvanantapuram..there is a well known padmanAbhasvAmi
temple there where viSnu is shown to be reclining...At the same time,
the place mentions the name "ananta" as in anantapadmanAbha or
anantazayana...
AFAIK, this is a reference to the river "penna/pennAr" whose southern
branch meets the sea near kaTalUr; the northern branch meets the sea
near nellUru in Andhra pradEza.
context mentions the village of Satyamangalam.
Isn't this the pAlAr river, which for all it's *milkiness*( namewise)
is perenially dry? I think this flows thru the South Arcot District..
BTW, Vidyasankar, could you please share the zlOka with us?
