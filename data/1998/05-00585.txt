In response to the recent post of Lakshmi Srinivas:

Thank you for this summary. I am not familiar with Mahadevan's work. The
Vedic filter [pavitra] was made from sheep's wool [aNvANi meSyaH] or a skin
[avya tvac], and not from more obdurate materials like ivory. I don't think
that one would find deeply drilled holes in the bottom of a Vedic pavitra.
Does Mahadevan address this difference?

Best wishes,

George Thompson
