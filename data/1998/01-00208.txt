Poison
Hi there Indologists,
I was wondering if any of you savants in the field of Ayurveda and rasAyanazAstra would be familiar with any of the following terms, all of which are supposedly poisons:
(1) amiras, Amirasa
(2) isvarya ras, IzvarIya rasa
(3) kulkarn, kunkAn
All of these words were heard orally and are thus likely incorrectly spelt. Any information to any reasonable approximation to any of these terms would be helpful.
Thanking you sincerely,
Jan Brzezinski
