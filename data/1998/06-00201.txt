Draft transliteration scheme on the Web
I do not care what Palaniappan uses for Tamil. For Prot0-Dravidian, z-subdot
makes better sense. As already pointed out by prof. Antony P. Stone, subbar
is used for alevolars consistently, _n, _r, _t. Let us not confuse
transliteration between Tamil and Proto-Dravidian. Let Tamil scholars
continue to use whatever they want. I appeal to Dr. Stone to provide
z-subdot for the benefit of those who decide  to use it.In my TVB I used
only l-sub-macron, but changed it later. LVRAiyar and French Scholars
consistently used z-subdot. The latest book on Dravidian languages
(Routledge, 1998) prefers z-subdot.If Tamil scholars think that the
phonetics of _l and PD *.z are the same (I do not know on what evidence!),
they can use either of  their pet symbols. While the use of symbols can be
arbitrary, there can be a method even in madness, just like using h for
aspirate stops, p:ph, k:kh, etc. Bh.K.
