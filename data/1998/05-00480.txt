I think I answered that already in my original posting: See the first few
lines above. As usual, SIMPLE answers are not available. The ponds
can refer to the cut-off ponds (u-shape lakes) or to the series of ponds
where the river ends in the desert.
The Avestan word is from vouru "wide" (Skt. uru) and ka.s'a "incision,
bay" (Skt. *karta, from kRt 'to cut"): 'having wide bays'.
It is a mythical lake or ocean, similar to the heavenly samudra/sindhu of
the Vedas. (Note the eastern and western hendu-s= sindhu-s of the Avesta)
