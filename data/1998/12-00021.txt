The significance of the decimal system is its naturalness; we have
10 fingers. That makes it easy for computation learning. For the
same reason, the use of base 20 in early societies is just as
natural. For primitive societies in which the illiterates were the
99%, base 20 is easy because you can go to your toes after you
are finished with your fingers. For two people the maximum is 40,
and that is why in Middle-East stories the number 40 is used in
many stories/legends as a kind of "maximum number". It would have
taken some sophistication to standardize on 10, and it did.
It was probably so because metal was stil expensive. Drilling
for spokes requires metal and so does the axle. Without those
you'd have serious problem. Leather would wear out quickly and
was probably a cheap-grade substitution.
The biggest problem is in getting planks from trees. How does
one cut along the tree to make planks? It would have been a major
undertaking for a society to make those things. It is not the
kind of thing that can be made by roving bands of herdsmen. IT is
too ridiculous to consider. It is possible that meteoric iron might
have been discovered (accidentally) and used for a short while and
maybe the knowledge spread, but mining is a serious business. Making
fires hot enought for baking bread is too much for nomads. How are
they supposed to smelt metal?
The metal rim on wheels and metal axles would not make it
worse, but better. After all friction and unevenness is
probably worse than having a few pounds to roll.
Yes, there is.
Yes, but it would have to be discovered and then created and then
spread. It is not impossible for axes, drills and hammers to be
bought by nomads for repairs after the technology has spread
everywhere. They might have been able to find wood during some
of their travels, or cannibalize old carts but to actually propose
that the nomads were importing wood, running mines, smelting
operations, etc is too much to believe, especially when none of
this was being done in civilized, sedentary societies in which
one might expect this kind of organization to exist.
Horse-dung and Cattle-dung is used for cooking and heating
probably even now. Nomads probably always lived on the fringe
of settled societies or were partially agriculturalists.
Probably in some desperate times or special circumstances they
started picking wars on settled peoples and that is what we
notice, not when they are dragging their cows around not
bothering anyone.
YOu have to drill wood for spokes. YOu also need to probably
cut planks to make the round part of the wheel itself that
the spokes go into. It could be from a sapling but then it
would have to be choopped and made into something like a flat
piece and that would require tools also.
YOu can probably make arrows from saplings. You break it off,
strip the bark and then heat treat it slowly and patiently
until it is as straight as you can make it. YOu can't break off
a branch; it would be too crooked, but some tree saplings shoot
up straight for relatively long heights.  I can't recall the name
but these trees grow really tall with relatively little growth
and branching sideways.
Best Regards,
