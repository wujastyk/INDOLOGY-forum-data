Epic DAIVAM
In Book 10, beginning in chapter 2, K.rpa tries to convince A"svatthAman
not to attack the Pandava camp during the night. Throughout most of his
speech in chapter 2, and occasionally later in this Book, he says that
both daiva and puru.sakAra are necessary for an activity, or maybe even a
desire, to become accomplished. Here, daiva is clearly juxtaposed to
"human action", so I have understood its meaning to be, here, "divine
action". Elsewhere, of course, its meaning may differ.
