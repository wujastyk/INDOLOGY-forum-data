Bhairava on coin
This is a possibility which I have overlooked. I shall look into it and
shall get back. Unfortunately, unlike many of the northern dynastic
coinage, medieval southern dynasties never bothered to write complete
names or titles on the coins. They were simply happy with few specific
puches corresponding to their dynasty. If there were legends, they were
very short (after all, there was hardly much space left after all those
multiple punches on a flan of a coin of 4 gms).
