The Cat
Better late than never, I hope, you'll want to track down a copy of the
following:
Heras, Fr. H.. "The Hypocritical Cat." Tamil Culture I (1952): 286-319
wherein the dissemination of this story is traced from the Mahabharata as
UR text, all across the Middle East and throughout European literature!
[If you'd can't find it, I'll can send you a xerox copy.
Hope this helps,
Michael Rabe
