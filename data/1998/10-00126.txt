  Dear colleagues,

  while translating Nyaabhashya I came across this phrase: annam vai
praa.nina.h praa.naa.h.(NBh I.1.2 p.76.16 in Nyaadarzanam, with
Vaatsyaayana's Bhaashya, Uddyotakara's Vaarttika, Vaacaspati Mizra's
Taatparya.tiikaa & Vizvanaatha's V.rtti, New Delhi, Munshiram
Manoharlal, 1985). It seems certainly to be a quotation, but I was not
able to identify source from which it was taken. Could anybody of you
help me in this connection? I'll be very grateful for any relevant
infromation.

Dmitry Olenev.
