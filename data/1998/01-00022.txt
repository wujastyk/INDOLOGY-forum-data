Subject: MacAuley's criticism of PurANic oceans
Message-ID: <161227034599.23782.9825251299550561399.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Greetings.

I have heard that MacAuley makes some critical remarks about the various
oceans of ghee, liquor, etc. described in the PurANas.  Do you know in what
publication he makes such statements?

Thank you for your help.
