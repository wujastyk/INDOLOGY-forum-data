[ANNOUNCEMENT] Sankhyakarikas uploaded
Ferenc Rusza (f_ruzsa at isis.elte.hu) has generously provided the electronic
text of the Sankhyakarikas for free download from the INDOLOGY ftp server
(ftp://ftp.ucl.ac.uk/pub/users/ucgadkw/indology/texts).
Rusza's etext is richer than usual, including variant readings from many
editions, and an index verborum.
I'm sure all INDOLOGY members will join me in thanking Ferenc for his hard
work and generosity in making these materials freely available to
scholars.
