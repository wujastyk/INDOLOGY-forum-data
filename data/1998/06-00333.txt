Thanks for the clarification!

Of course. I only mentioned it as parallel development (like in
Scandinavian, Sardinian). And, just in case that Aust. once had passed
through India (in the out-of-Africa scheme) and had left a substratum
there... which particular (retr.) scenario obviously does not work now.

I believe in a similar scenario but I  am still at the stage of
collecting data/proofs. Hence my questions, to go beyond Zevebil 1970
(Comp.Drav.Phonology)


To provide two somewhat "outrageous" scenarios:

(1) If PDrav. _t, .t etc. are securely PDrav. (as also in Zvelebil/DED)
is there any INTERNAL evidence in PDrav. that they might have developed
(in *pre*-Proto-Drav.) from various Sandhi positions / particular phonetic
surroundings.

I gather, not?


(2) if  (1) does not work, and waht I also had in mind:  has anyone an
opinion on:

 Nostratic **t  > PDrav. *.t,  etc.?

A brief check of various sounds/and groups in : Illich-Svitych, Opyt...,
Moskva 1971-6 follows.

If I understand him correctly, he reconstructs Drav. retroflexes as
conditioned by *intervocalic position* in Nostratic. I am somewhat
hampered now as I have left my Russian Dict. in the office.

I am quoting from Illich's dictionary (nith his no.s) , merely adding DED2
numbers (hopefully correctly), as he only has DED1 page numbers (which I
don't have here)

        (Afro-Asiatic, AfrAs,  for his, older, Hamito_Semitic)
        (NB. Nostr. .t, .k,   etc. are of course NOT retroflexes)

(He has many more  cases of _r, .r,  -l, .l)

Any opinion?   Or is that *too early* to ask?


This is important:
If one accepts the Nostraticists' position, then the Dravidians, too,
started to retroflex their tongues only *after* entering the
subcontinent.... as nearly everybody else.
