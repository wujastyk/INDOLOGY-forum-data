People do concede an earlier defeat if they win at a later point in time. At
least in inscriptions. The Velvikkudi grant of the neTuJcaTaiyan2 does mention
the Pandya country being overrun and ruled by kalabhran. Ofcourse a Pandyan
king regains the kingdom. Strangely, Classical Tamil texts do talk about an
expedition of Mauryas into Tamilnadu which northern sources do not seem to
mention. Kharavela's inscription mentions a Tamil confederacy lasting for a
long time and finally being defeated by Kharavela. Tamil texts are silent
about Kharavela.
