A comment on writing Indian scripts using email text. While Harvard and Kyodo
have a joint convention using capitals for sounds such as N R S T...
I have found a simpler method and less of a strain on the eyes. Following the
earlier transliteration practices of affixing diacritical marks on tops of the
english alphabet, I sugges the following simple rule (which I have used for
the entire Indian Lexicon at the Sarasvati web):

Affix the diacritical following the english alphabet.

For example, 
A can be written as a_
S as s.
z as s'
N as n.
T as t.
R as r.
A half-nasal Hindi haa:n as ha~_ Tamil ZH as r..

Best regards,
Kalyanaraman
