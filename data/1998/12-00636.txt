Looks like one would show anything to put forth a claim that
Dravidian culture foreshadowed IA.  Could be true, but not thru
Smith.  Poor connection.

I do understand these a little more than you would assume.
I doubt if you have studied people of India.  Books don't
say what people think.  I suggest that you go and visit
the villages.  You would discover.  Interview as many
people as you can to get a sample.  You may do that
in the US to get a sense.

These look like attacks than any substance.  Please refrain
from making casual political comments.
What the mutts do has nothing to do with what people think.
Please don't get agitated and get off-track.  By the way,
your earlier postings had some good new stuff.

My knowledge of Dravidian material is miniscule.  To discover
the linguistic connection from Tamil to Sanskrit and find
the foundation of IA in Dravidian culture will be a very
significant contribution indeed.

Have a peaceful new year..
