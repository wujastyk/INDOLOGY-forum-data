Apparently the present generation of Indologists are not familiar with the
arguments of Jules Bloch why OIA has ghoTa(ka) 'horse' > Hi. ghoDaa, etc.,
which has no IE-etymology (unlike Skt. as'va-). He derives ghoTa- (with
guNa) from a  root *ghuT- which he derives from Pre-Drav. *ghutr-. He then
derives Ta.kutirai, Ma.kutira, Ka. kudire and Te. guR(R)amu, Konda guRam
'horse' from the root *ghutr- saying that pre-Dravidian had not only voicing
contrast but also aspirates! ( I have given references to Jules Bloch's
article in my TVB).The Dravidian words are quite ancient and were not
borrowed from anyother known langauge. He suggested that Telugu preserved
the PDr. voiced stop while the South Drav languages had devoiced g- to k-.
He also derived Skt. gaard-abha- 'donkey' and Ta. kaZutai, Ka. katte, Te.
gaaDida from *gard- again Te. preserving PDr. voiced stop.  Apart from the
linguistic ingenuity of these etymologies, which not many scholars (maybe
nobody) questioned then, at the semantic and cultural level,this hypothesis
presupposes that 'the horse' could be native to pre-Aryan India! Of course,
donkeys do not pose a problem; they are cultural universals! Bh.K.
