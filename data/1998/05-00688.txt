Dear Sir, whatever your fields of learning, apparently they do not include
either Vedic philology or archeology of South Asia.
Indeed, a few months ago, when suggestions were being made for articles/books
to be read before participating in an email-discussion related to Indo-Aryan im-

unfortunately not mentioned.
