That is indeed something to take into account.

"Tamil" is a well established form in English.   One may see "Tamizh"
already, but there would be no real need for "Tamiz" to come in.   (The
standard is not going to suggest a simplified transliteration with the
diacritics simply omitted.    Without diacritics,  Tamil .t usually becomes
t and t becomes th.   Also .s usually becomes sh and "s becomes either sh
or s.)

Now I am getting things clear in my mind!   The proposed standard is
required to deal with the transliteration of written symbols in actual
scripts.    As I understand it, treatment of PD is in fact transcription
[of sounds], which will  *not*  be covered by the standard.    So I see two
possibilities:

(A) l_macr-b in the standard.   This allows z_dot-b to be used for the PD
phoneme if a  distinction is desired.    

(B) z_dot-b in the standard.   No such scope.

Certainly the forms with two dots below are ruled out on readability
considerations.

I do not see any majority wanting z_dot-b for transliteration of scripts as
opposed to transcription of sounds.   I myself noticed the logical aspects
in its favour, but they are not decisive.    It now looks to me as if
l_macr-b might be best for transliteration, but I wait for responses to
this posting.
