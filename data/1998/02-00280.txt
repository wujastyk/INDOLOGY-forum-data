There is already a Japanese work:
        Shizutani, Masao: Indo bukkyo himei mokuroku.
        Kyoto : Heirakuji shoten, 1979
        (Catalogue of Indian Buddhist inscriptions)
It is said to contain a comprehensive (but not exhaustive) list
of inscriptions. It was unavailable in the German interlibrary
system, so I haven't seen it directly, though. In the late
eighties I contacted a bookseller in Tokyo who gave me the
information that it is out of print.
Perhaps it may serve as a good starting point -- even if one does
not read Japanese.
All the best
