In my earlier post I had written:
 in other words while the zaivas and vaiSNavas simply debated the status
ofthe languages, the buddhist texts seem to have put a religious spin
onthe existing conflict by talking about the revelation of the
"vIracOziyam" by buddha.
>----------------------------


I meant to say "the revealation of Tamil by Buddha" as stated in the
vIracOziyam....I apologize for the error.

REgards,
