While skimming last night a few pages beyond a passage I was reading for my
own research, I noticed a further early source for the example
gandhavattvavat, which Jeson Woo made the subject of a query on 29 August
1997.

UddyotakaraH introduces gandhavattvam in conclusion of his comment on
NyAyasUtram 3.1.3 (NyAyadarzanam, ed. T. Nyaya-Tarkatirtha, 1985: 716.8-11:

On 29 September 1997, I submitted this reply:

Some time ago (29 August), Jeson Woo inquired:

Within a few days Horst Lasic identified a source, and I contributed a comment.
Today I would like to give further evidence that the example was known, and
how it was understood. jayantaH uses the example at nyAyamaJjarI (ed.
Suryanarayana Sukla) 2.26.5-6:

arthakriyAsamarthasya tvaduktaM sattvamastu vA |
tadapi vyAptiZUnyatvAnna heturgandhavattvavat ||

cakradharaH explains this (nyAyamaJjarIgranthibhaGgaH 192.18-20): *na
heturgandhavattvavat* | yathA gandhavattvaM nityatvenityatve vA na hetuH
tena sahA[nya]trAdRSTeH evaM sarvasya sAdhyatvAt sattvasya kZaNikatvena
