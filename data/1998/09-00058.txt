Hi,
In addition to the posting of Krishna on Mahadevan's survey in an Indian
History Congress, there was a comprehensive review of Rao's decipherment by
Mahadevan in Puratattva. An excellent bibliography which also references mine
is in Parpola, Deciphering the Indus Script.
Regards,
kalyanaraman.

Indus script. There is supposed to be a review of his work in the American
Journal of Oriental Studies. I would be grateful for bibliographic references
to this review, and also to any other reviews and discussions of Rao's books
("Lothal and the Indus Civilization"; "The Decipherment of the Indus Script").
