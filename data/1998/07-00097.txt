Indo-Kafiri-Iranians
I have several questions relating to the Indo-Kafiri-Iranian languages.
1)  Is there a reliable? chronology for the separation of the Dardic
and Nuristani/Kafiri languages from those of Indo-Iranian ?
2)How similar are the languages to each other and do they form a
common system of communication ?
3)Is it possible to detect substratum influences within the same
language family:  such as Kafiri and Indo-Aryan ?
I apologise if these questions should be directed to the Indo-Iranian
page.
