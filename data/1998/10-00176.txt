Hinduism and the Internet
I have had an enquiry directed to me about whether there is anyone currently doing
research on Hinduism and the Internet.   This is specifically in connection with an
international conference on media, religion and culture to be held in Edinburgh next
July (20th-23rd) but also for more general information.   Does anyone have any
information that I could pass on?
