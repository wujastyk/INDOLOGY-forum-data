Take a look at "Samkara and Suresvara: Their exegetical method to
interpret the great sentence. `TAT TVAM ASI'", S. Mayeda, Adyar Library
Bulletin, K. Kunjunni Raja Felicitation Volume, pp. 147-160.

IMO, this is only a restatement of the stuff found in the
Naishhkarmyasiddhi. Not much of historical details, since that's what
you seem interested in.
