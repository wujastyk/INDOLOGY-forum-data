Hi,
Please check out the site:

This is a comprehensive compendium, together with a bibliography of
western and Indian sources on astrology, covering a spectrum of the
history of iconography based on both Gopinatha Rao and Jitendra Nath
Bannerjee, framework of Indian astrology, sample horoscope preview,
excerpts from Encyclopaedia Britannica related to ancient astral omens,
navagraha stotras and krtis, ashtottara-nama-vali for each graha, the
recently introduced Navagraha Temple Tour to the nine unique, mammoth
temples of the Chola period in Tamilnadu,links to the UNESCO world
heritage site for Konarak (sun temple), an audio clip on Gayathri, and
links to NASA for the planets of the Solar System.

Kindly provide info.on the astral phenomena and events described in the
Mahabharata, and kaalaganana as enumerated in the Sankalpas, so that these
can also be annotated and added, to provide a perspective
on the concept of and history of time as perceived by indologists.
