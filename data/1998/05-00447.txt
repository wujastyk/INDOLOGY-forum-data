I do not wish to enter the thread of your discussion but something
just caught my eye.

Correct me if I'm wrong but I understand Mughal has only surveyed the
dry bed of the Hakra in the erstwhile Bahawalpur State (Cholistan),
not excavated any site there. For example, Ganweriwala continues to
remain unexcavated.

Warm Regards.
