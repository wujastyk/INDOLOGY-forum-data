The observations are scintillating and thought-provoking indeed. The postings
are as relevant as the observations made by KV Sarma in the Adyar Bulletin on
vedic culture in San:gam literature to evaluate the cultural contacts in
ancient South Asia.

The following lexemes may perhaps also be relevant in the context of kOtu =
pottery.

got.ri = muddy, dirty (Kui)(DEDR 2067); kut.t.am = pond, depth (Ta.)(DEDR
1669); kun.d.a = pit (Skt.)

khuda_, khoda_ = to dig (B.); godu = hole (K.)(CDIAL 3934) khot.ranu = to dig
(S.); khotar = burnt sediment of milk (N.)(CDIAL 3512) kot.ara = hollow of a
tree (Skt.)(CDIAL 3496) khod.ra_ = id. (Kur.)(DEDR 1660).

kottan- = a mason (Ta.)(DEDR 2091).But, cf. od.ru = a caste that make mud
walls (S.); od. = a caste of Hindus who dig and carry earth and build mud
houses (G.)(CDIAL 2549)

In legend, Agastya is also known as the sage born of the pot. Another issue,
however, is the date of Agastya. 

Best regards,
Kalyanaraman
