Want to know the references on identifying Sarasvati of the
Rig Veda as the Ghaggar river. Who did this identification first?
Did s/he publish it?
See the old posting in Indology. If Aristouboulos in 330 BCE
is referring to Indus valley civilization (IVC) ruins,
the ruins are already 1200 to 1400 years old.
This fits well with the dating of the vedas to 1200 BCE,
in my opinion. Some scholars even say Rig veda is 1000 BCE.
BTW, recent scholarship shows that upani.sads have been dated
too early. They are really few centuries later than the
conventional wisdom.
Would like to see references on the dating of the
drying of rivers in Indus valley.
