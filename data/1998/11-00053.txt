Hello everybody,

we are preparing the third volume of our on-line journal KOLAM
(http://www.uni-koeln.de/phil-fak/indologie/kolam/frame.html).

We would be happy to receive contributions in the form of articles (also
with illustrations), and comments on the previous 2 volumes, as well as
suggestions.

With best wishes,
Ulrike
(for the editors)
