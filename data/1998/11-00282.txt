The ending "Amma" for men
You have the fomous scientist nAyuDamma.
Ending in amma for kRSNa seems to be a term of endearment
for Lord KRSNa.
We have the telugu folk song
" kiSTammA! gOpAlabAlA kiSTammA!
bhaja nanadAkumAra bAlakiSTammA - gOpAlabAlA kiSTammA!"
I think kRSNamanIdu is also a usage.

sarma.
