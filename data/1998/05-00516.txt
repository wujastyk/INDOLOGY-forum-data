My suggestion: Do the investigation, then we ca talk. Also see R.
Zydenbos' example. And a lot more, plus the saagara "ocean"  often
indicating lakes nowadays !

Unfortunately, the Rgveda does not knwo about South India and the closest
ocean was the Arabian sea, definitley SOUTH of the Panjab, at least after
the continental drift.

The next northern ocean I have read about in Indian texts is the "ocean of
sand" in Kalhana's Rajatanrangini 1150 AD...

Certainly, but this is not a mathematical problem with "elegant
proofs"...

As A. Hillebrandt (under the pseudonym Fritz Bon-sens)
wrote about the Rgveda a hundred years ago, in the tradition of the great
Euheumeros:

"Indra war ein grosser Raja -- so wie es auch heute noch in Indien viele
Rajas gibt..."

<Indra was a great Raja, just as today, there still are many Rajas in
India...>

The RV is not a geography handbook. But complicated IA/IE poetry.  Each
passage needs detailed investigation. All I did was to cast some
(intra-textual) doubt on the "proof passage" of the "great Sarasvati" in
the *later* RV.
