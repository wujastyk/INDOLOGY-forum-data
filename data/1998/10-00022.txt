[SV: some op/old books on India & British India]
Couldn't we have a kind of "license" system here? In other word: Why don't we
invite some booksellers to post their lists on Indology? I should think that
the number of qualified indological/orientalist booksellers can't be that
enormous, and consequently, the list would not be swamped with unwanted
mailings.> 
I agree with Lars Martin Fosse entirely. Without such postings, we will be the
losers. If there is a problem on the size of word count in a mailing, I will
be happy to host the lists on the web with an URL reference on the indology
mailing list and add a link at the yahoo sarasvatisindhu club site.

Kalyanaraman
