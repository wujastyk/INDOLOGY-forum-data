Uttara Kuru
This was an interesting program. Some of the pictures on the cave walls
reminded me of Buddha. Also, the TILAK or BINDI on the forehead suggests
that this may have HINDU connection. However the text did not mention
anything on this possibility.
Ancient indian travel to central asia are recorded.
