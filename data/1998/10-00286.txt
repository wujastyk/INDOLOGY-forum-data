Puri: Jagannatha Temple: Relics
     Re: Puri: Jagannatha Temple: Relics
<I just recently came across a 19th c. reference to relic bones in the
<Jagganatha Temple in Puri, which are supposedly associated with Krsna.
<Considering the pollution associated with death and the body in
Hinduism
<this would seem to be  highly unusual, not to say unlikely.
<Does anybody know anything about this Puri legend or any other Hindu
<veneration practices of  body relics ?
<Was Puri a Buddhist site at one time?
    For this query posed a while ago by Mary Storm, few responses
    came by. Recently, I found one interesting quote by
    Swami Vivekananda in his article, The Sages of India.
    He says Puri was a Buddhist site.
