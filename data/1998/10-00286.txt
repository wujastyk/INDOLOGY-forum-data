<I just recently came across a 19th c. reference to relic bones in the
<Jagganatha Temple in Puri, which are supposedly associated with Krsna.

<Does anybody know anything about this Puri legend or any other Hindu

<Was Puri a Buddhist site at one time?

    For this query posed a while ago by Mary Storm, few responses
    came by. Recently, I found one interesting quote by
    Swami Vivekananda in his article, The Sages of India.
    He says Puri was a Buddhist site.
