JNU Guesthouse/hostel
Dear Indologists,
A very unacademic question, if allowed by the moderator, but even scholars have to eat and sleep: does anyone have infromation on guesthouses or hostels connected with JNU, New Delhi and how one can apply to stay there?
Many thanks in advance
Thomas de Bruijn
