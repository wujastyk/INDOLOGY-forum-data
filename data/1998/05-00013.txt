*Ganesan, I have no problem with your quoting this footnote
*from A.K.Ramanujan's book, which I know all too well from
*multiple readings of the book, as evidence of a certain
*historical tension between Tamil and Sanskrit over the
*centuries... Zvelebil has some additional remarks on this
*issue in the last or penultimate chapter of his "Companion
*Studies to history of Tamil literature".

 Thanks, Srini. Zvelebil has some points.
 I have lots more from Tamil literature which I will give you some day.

*But let us try to be accurate when quoting and not add words
*of our own, even if it were for clarification !

*There is no "we, the brahmins," in the footnote... the line
*simply reads "It looks as if we will be the same wherever we
*are".  Unless it is an extreme case of printer's devil, that
*is what my personal copy of the book says too - I just confirmed
*it.


Before making the original posting, I confirmed whether
the Tamil original says the conversation is  between brahmins.
The reference is M. Venugoplasvami Nayudu, tiruvEgkaTattantaati,
Coimbatore, 1934.

You might have noticed that in addition, I misspelt a word
"thais" instead of "this"; (I do not mean Thai people :-) )
I broke up the conversation into separate units; and gave the
K. K. A. Venkatachari's full citation.
This citation does not occur inside the AKR story, but is given
elsewhere in his book. Real sorry for not adding these details.

"muraTTuc samskritam" is the "rough-sounding sanskrit" of AKR's words.

Let me quote another 13th century zrIvaiSNava commentary portion.
Can you please translate this?
"vaTa ticai pin2pu kaaTTi - vaTakkut tikku aariya puumi
aakaiyaalE, camaskrita muraNaraay, aazvaarkaL iirac collum
naTaiyaaTaata tEcamAkaiyaalE, attikkait tiruttum pOtu,
pin2pazaku ellaam vENum en2Riruntaar".
(To be clear, the details are: in the old book of M. V. Nayudu the sandhi is not
exploded, no gaps between words, no punctuation either.)

Thanks,
N. Ganesan
