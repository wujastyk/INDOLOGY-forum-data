Dear Member,
Thank you for your interest in my Sanskrit composition. Here is its
transliteration:

kah kaa vaa 'yam iyam veti mohayantii budhaan api /
mahaamaayaavinii kaachid bhaashaa jayatu laukikii //
vaagatiitas tayor aatmaa striipumvyaktivivarjitah /
ye vidus te 'pi maayaayaam klishyanti kraantadarshinah //

Best wishes.
KSA
