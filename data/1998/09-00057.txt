Iravatham Mahadevan as I remember it, reviewed his work as part of an
overall review presented at the Annual Session of the Indian History
Congress in 1996(I believe) under the title "nEti! nEti!"( NOT thus!
NOT thus!). In addition, there also exists a more "populist" review
by Shireen Ratnaugar in the "India Today" if I remember right, but this
seems (atleast to me) a simplified version of the former...


Regards,
Krishna
