Dr Hardy
I happened to get hold of a book "The Muslims of British India" by Dr P. Hardy
(1972).
I am very impressed by the amount of research but the book does not give any
details about the author. I would like to know his whereabouts and if he has an
email address so that I can contact him personally.
Have a peaceful and prosperous day.

Thought of the day:
 The Family: that noble institution responsible for 70 percent of
 all murders, over 80 percent of incidents of child abuse, and a
 full 100 percent of all cases of incest.
