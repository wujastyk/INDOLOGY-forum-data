The Airyana Vaejah was described as mountainous country in which was

an "aboriginal" people in the Vedas.
A lot of focus in this argument is placed on identifying the soma
or haoma of the Rgveda and Avesta. Most strongly deny that the soma
used in modern brahmin rituals is the same as the Vedic soma.  Indian
sources state that soma comes from Mujavant or Mujavat.  There is
a Mount Mujavant in the Himalayas.  However, there are numerous other
theories on the origin of soma.
