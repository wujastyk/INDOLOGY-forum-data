The _International Journal of Hindu Studies_ is planning a 'Millennium in
Hinduism' issue to appear in the year 2000. We encourage potential authors
to consider the theme as widely as possible and to engage with past and
future millennium events, as well as the phenomenon of millennialism, in
Hindu religious traditions. Possible theme topics include: yuga theories,
Kalki avatara, creation of the golden age in ritual space and time, gurus
and mahants who are perceived by their followers to usher in the golden
age, sense of apocalypsm in the Mahabharata, and pralaya and the
re-creation of the universe.

Contributions submitted for this special issue will be evaluated through
the usual _International Journal of Hindu Studies_ peer reviews.
Manuscripts, including notes, should not exceed 40 pages in length. Please
submit four copies. All submitted work should be double-spaced, including
extracts, notes, and references. Footnotes should be as few as possible,
and typed double-spaced at the end of the text.  Documentation should
follow the style recommended in sections 16.3 through 16.28 of the
_Chicago Manual of Style_, 14 ed. Authors are encouraged to submit tables,
figures, maps, photographs, and other illustrations along with their
manuscripts; please consult the editor for specifications.  Additional
guidelines on manuscript preparation will be sent upon request.

The deadline for submission is January 30, 1999. Completed manuscripts,
inquiries about material for possible publication, and correspondence to
the editor should be send to the Journal's editorial offices:
