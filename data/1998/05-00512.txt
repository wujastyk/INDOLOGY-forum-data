Thank you fo your informative data! I just have a few minor points this
time:

Certainly, but some data are better than others: RV 3.33 with the
confluence of the Beas and Sutlej, for example.

yes, especially if wee add LOCAL investigation, for example of
archaeological sequences (as you mention below, too),  as to date certain
palaeo-channels "in use", filled with water, and running rivers. As I
said, you do not build straight on the flood plain unless the river is
small and there is only a small chance to get flooded.

Fine, for the "great Sarasvati" (*perhaps* remembered later on).

The question still pending is : when. *Local* geological, archaeological
etc. investigation at the Satlej bend is necessary.

from Sindh? Shaffer speaks of late/post Indus people movement from the
*Panjab* into the Kuruksetra/Haryana, and upper doab area.

If you mean: during the main periods of the Indus/Harappan civ. is there
any evidence for movement away from Sindh? Recent excavations at Harappa
(Kenoyer, Meadow, Wright etc,) indicate that there was a continuity of
development from the pre-Indus ("Ravi phase") civ. to the Indus civ.
