Vivekananda &c.
I wonder if there is not a confusion here. I do not have access to the texts quoted below, but it seems to me, in quotation, that the reference here may well be to SCHOLARLY ERUDITION rather than what we would call "spiritual knowledge". Obviously, Shudras could hardly become knowledgeable about the scriptures if they were precluded from reading/hearing them. At the same time, I see that Shankara makes no attempt to water down verse 9.32 of the Bhagavad Gita in his commentary. This verse explicitly asserts that the "supreme state" (paraa.m gati.m) is open to women and Shudras too, and Shankara merely rephrases the assertion, substituting "gacchanti" for "yaanti" and "prk.rshtaa.m" for "paraa.m". He was undoubtedly a man of his time - as we all are! - but I feel that one can over-emphasise his arid traditionalism, unless, of course, one includes such verses as the above from the Bhagavad Gita in his "tradition". Ramakrishna too behaved rather unbecomingly to our eyes in leaping away when his feet were touched in devotion by an ex-courtisan. But these are surely minor warts on great men, who could afford a few little conditioned weaknesses from their past environment. Would that we all had such minor blemishes!
