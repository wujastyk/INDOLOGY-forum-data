R.si Loma'sa
No, Lomahar.sa.na (the suuta, father of Ugra'sravas who recites the
Mahabharata) does not seem to be the same person as Loma'sa, the rishi who
accompanies the Pandavas on their tiirthayaatraa (Mbh. III) as a kind of
religious guide who tells them a lot of stories. See also Vettam Mani,
Puranic Encyclopaedia, Delhi 1975. Apparently, little else is known about
this Loma'sa.
