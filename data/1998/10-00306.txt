Testing devanagari script in e-mail
Yes, that works but it is quite a nuisance!  You cannot even see html file
unless you  try to forward message, then double click it and it opens in
Explorer, then view source coed in notepad. Then edit out <pre> and save and
close file. Then double click it again as html and it opens as devanagari.
Are you sending it in normal html?? do you have any other settings?? There
was a message on Indology about how to send devanagari files (even without
fonts) on INTERNET, did you read that?? I think this an  extremely important
concept to develop!! Thanks for working on it!!
