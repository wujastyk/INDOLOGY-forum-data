medieval Vedic texts? The RV and te other Vedic texts were composed much
earlier: as even quotations in Panini and the Pali canon show... I give
up!
Better to get the data right before drawing such hasty conclusions.
As for text interpretation: if we do or jb of understanding these texts
well, we can restore even damaged texts correctly, as indeed happend to me
long ago in my thesis, when I discovered the actual wording restored by
me, hidden under some broken off section of a birchbark manuscript that
was not visible in the film I used...
Every interpretation is of course an approximation, until you use time
travel and talk to the local people, lots of them... We have been at it
for some 150 years now... and know something about these texts, for
example all, those points I critized above. And more importantly, we know
quite well what we do *not* know, for example about the 'little tradition"
in the RV. (for that we read te Atharvaveda etc.)
There are no Avestan inscriptions. We would be so happy. If only the 3/4
of the lost Avesta corpus could be found in Balkh, allegedly written there
before "Alexander destroyed the texts"! Facts, again....
With our data coming straight from the Vedic period itself we do not
extrapolate backwards for 3000-odd years... we *listen* to what Visvamitra
or Vasistha composed. (Such tapes & records have been published).
Using your wording, we "do know the dating for sure" - I suppose the
medieval MSS? That, we know for sure indeed. (otherwise the passage makes
not sense to me)  --- But we can also make very good educated guesses (and
do even better) about the historical situation of the time of the
composition. Of course, we can use poetic texts and mine them for some
historical information: Using the famous line from the Psalms where the
author (Salomon, I think) compares his girl friend's teeth to the parapets
of the walls of Jerusalem you can make some deductions about (a)
Jer.having a type of wall, and (b) about the ideal nature of teeth/ a
smile usual (or conversely the uneven nature of teeth) at the time...
Again, well known procedures.
By your standard we should give up the use of texts such as Homer's, the
Bible, Roman annals, old Chinese history, the Kojiki etc., since all of
them have "medieval MSS" (well, a few are a bit earlier). Tell that to the
Israelis,  the Chinese etc. !
The term "Vedic peoples" is not a good one. 'Tribes speaking Old
Indo-Aryan' or the 'Vedic variety of Old Indo-Aryan' would be correct.
"Vedic peoples"  would be those who use that language, and adhere to the
cultural norms spelled out in the texts. All well known (Kuiper,
Southworth etc.)_
