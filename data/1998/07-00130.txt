t vs k, c, and p. Consider the root kEL- to hear. From it are derived forms
like kELkkunnu, kELppin2, etc. Note L does not change into T. On the other
hand, with the suffix tt, it is kETTu and not kELttu. Similarly with the root
vaRaL - to dry up, we have vaRaLcca dryness, but vaRaTTuka to dry up, vaRaTi
barren woman.
So I do not see anything unique about the above situation in Sanskrit which
cannot be explained with a Dravidian origin of retroflexion.
