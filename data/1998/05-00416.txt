Sarasvati
I agree.....the dating of when Sarasvati stopped flowing from
the mountains to the sea is critical because that would make the Rgveda
prior to it.
Hope that Prof Witzel comments on this issue.
I would also like to request Mr. Houben to add this work to his list:
J Harmatta.
The Emergence of the Indo-Iranians: The Indo-Iranian languages.
History of Civilizations of Central Asia. Vol 1.
Ed: A.H.Dani and V.M Masson.
