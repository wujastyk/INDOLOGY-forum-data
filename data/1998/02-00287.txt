Naciketas
from
Belloni-Filippi.
to
it.
Thanks for the remarks.
The old stories of Naciketas - the variations in Taittiriya Brahmana,
Katha Upanishad, Mahabharata, Varaha purana - call him "Naciketas" and
speak only about his father as family, never mentioning his mother.
In the MSS that I have seen until now, which seem to be variations of
the story in Varaha Purana, there are two main differences:
1 - "Naciketas" is turned into "NAsiketa" (with some variations), and
the name is derived from "nAsa" - nose.
2 - The story gives an extended history of Nasiketa's mother -
Candravati - and of his conception and birth through the nose.
I believe that these differences have got a significance beyond the
literary interest. That is the reason why I would like to find the first
source in the scriptures where the changes took place.
As i have mentioned, most MSS claim their origin in Bramanda Purana, but
I have not come accross any text of this purana where the
NAsiketopAkhyAnam could be found.
I shall be grateful for any information in this matter.
Thanks in advance.
