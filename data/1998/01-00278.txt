Telegu inscription
The self-oblation in Pallava inscriptions must be checked from the
monumental book:
T. V. Mahalingam, Inscriptions of the Pallavas, Delhi, 1988, 818 p.
It is time to put the vast number of inscriptions, available in plenty
in South India,  on the web. Like Univ. of Koeln website of
tamil texts, the Pallava, Chola, Pandya, Rashtrakuta, Chalukya
and Vijayanagar inscriptions must be made available on the net.
Hope thatday is not far off to check about self-oblation thru
URL addresses!
If Mary Storm writes a paper or thesis, I want to know
the reference.
Thanks,
N. Ganesan
