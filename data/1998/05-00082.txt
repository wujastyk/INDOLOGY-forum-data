        There was also a peculiar practice in Tamilnadu. In some of the
        cases of Sannyasis and Siddhas, after the bodily physiological
        activities cease, a coconut was broken on the top of the head.
        This was called , the "kapAla mOksha"  among the
        Tamils. This was done in order to release the soul from
        the body. After that the remains were buried.
