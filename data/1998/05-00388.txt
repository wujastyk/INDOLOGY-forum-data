The main preoccupation of the Indian army during this period was the
Notheh-West Frontier (now NW Frontier state of Pakistan) where the Army
foruht Pathan tribesman from Afghanistan. Also around this time, the
British Indian army had border skirmishes with Persia. It may be that, for
the forces along that border, it would be an obvious tool. I know that the
officers Scinde Horse and various other forces along that border had to
know Hindustani/Urdu and perhaps Persian. But I don't believe that the
Bombay and Madras armies in the south needed to know Persian so perhaps
that Welsh miner was in one of the (few) totally European regiments in the
NW frontier.
