An appeal to Indologists (Was Re: Indo-Aryan invasion)

I think both Viktor V. Sukliyan and K.V.N Gopal have a point and their
preoccupation with preserving a precious cultural heritage is entirely
accurate.
I would like to interject a note of optimism, however.
 It seems to me that our Indian friends may simply be doing what we did
in Europe : we "unlearned" Latin and Greek in our schools; we
"unlearned" classical litterature and poetry. We "unlearned" attending
theaters when they play Shakespeare, Racine or Goethe.We "unlearned"
going to classical concerts unless some star is plkaying, etc. All of
this of course was to the benefit of the Mac Donald's culture which is
prevailing nowadays.
Yet this does not mean that our cultural heritage disappeared. It simply
became common ground of joy and study for fewer people than before. May
be this is what is happening in India ?
