A few years ago I was reading a lot of books about
the ancient history of Tamils and also of Sri Lanka.
While less frequent than the "East India" theory, I did
also encounter statements that the ancestors of today's
Sinhalas came from Gujarat.  Unfortunately, I can't
cite the references.
By the way, Thor Heyerdahl's "Maldive Mystery" also has
something to say about this, though it is far from being
a scholarly book.
