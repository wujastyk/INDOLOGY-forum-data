negations and their names
I recently was warned by Katsura Shoryu that it is incorrect to write a
hyphen in the expression Paryudasa- and Prasajya-pratisedha. According to
Katsura,  "there is no cp. like 'paryudasa-pratisedha'. 'paryudasa' means
'negation.'"
However, I have found the term in Mahavyutpatti 4510; to this Katsura
suggests it may be a retranslation from Tibetan. OK. Again, I pointed out
that in Frits Staals' Reader in the Skt. Grammarians, p. 496, note 55,  so
great an authority as Louis Renou uses the same term. OK. Even Homer nods.
QUESTION: does the compound paryudaasa-pratis.edha exist in actual Sanskrit
texts? (I would expect that if it comes up, it would be in grammar or
logic, but any actual attestation would be of interest. )
Much out of my depth, jonathan
