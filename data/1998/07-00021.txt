Sorry, some words were left out in the above. Here is the full text.

But he does say, "While this paper does not try to deal in full with the split
 in Dravidian which has been referred to here, it should also be noted in this
 context in passing that this split is also paralleled in Indo-Aryan by such
 interchanges which occur in Pali and the Prakrits as between D and l as well
as between r and L and by occasional alternation in Old Indo-Aryan forms
between D, L and l."
