Certainly the development of <s^> (Ascii-IPA [S]) out of PIE *s after
<i>, <u>, <r>, <k> has nothing to do with Dravidian, as it also
happened in Iranian, Slavic, Baltic and possibly Armenian.  The
development of this <s^> ("sh") to <s.> (retroflex) has nothing to do
with Dravidian either, but with the development of PIE *k^ to the
palatal shibilant <s'>.  This, as has happened relatively recently in
Polish, Russian and Mandarin Chinese, caused the old shibilant to be
backed to <s.> (Polish sz vs. s', Russian sh vs. shch, Mandarin sh
vs. x).  In Proto-Slavic RUKI /s^/ was backed to /x/ (velar
fricative) [except when palatalized] instead.  In Baltic RUKI /s^/
was allowed to merge with /s^/ < *k^.  In Iranian *k^ appears as /s/,
presumably by way of k^ > c^ ("ch") > c ("ts") > s [without a stage
as s^].   In tabular form:
        *s^ (RUKI)  *k^ (SATEM)
Skt.    s.          s'
Iran.   s^          s < c
Slav.   x           s < s^
Balt.   s^          s^
