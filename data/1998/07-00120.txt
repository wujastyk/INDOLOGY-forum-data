another Indian pancake question
a side question:
        In Divyaavadaana (Cowell & Neil 258.9) occurs the word
ma.n.diilaka(a).  While apparently ma.n.daka is a kind of thin pancake-like
bread, I cannot discover the meaning of ma.n.diilaka.  (It is of course
possible that the text is corrupt...)
Any suggestions?
