Subject: another Indian pancake question
In-Reply-To: <MailDrop1.2d7d.980709193228@langmac6.york.ac.uk>

a side question:

        In Divyaavadaana (Cowell & Neil 258.9) occurs the word
ma.n.diilaka(a).  While apparently ma.n.daka is a kind of thin pancake-like
bread, I cannot discover the meaning of ma.n.diilaka.  (It is of course
possible that the text is corrupt...)

Any suggestions?
