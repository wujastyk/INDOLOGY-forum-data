Query on the term *mistri*
French is out since the `s' of that word had ceased to be pronounced
long before the 18th century. One down, three to go.
And is it usual for English long `ah' (the vowel of `master') to
be borrowed as `E' in Telugu? Are there other examples of that?
I'm curious why the long `I' in `mEstrI' and a short `i' in `sOjiri'?
Also what's with the `r's? Were there lots of Scots in India? :)
