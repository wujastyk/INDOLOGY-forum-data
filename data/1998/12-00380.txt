Indian Gemmology
Dear Scholars,
I'm going to study Indian treatises on Gemmology, and with this aim I have
already collected some basilar books edited in the last century by western
scholars. Moreover, I got also several articles on the subject published on
the Indian Journal of History of Science. Would anyone suggest other books
or articles on this subject? Many thanks in advance. Riccardo Garbini.
sincerely yours,riccardo
