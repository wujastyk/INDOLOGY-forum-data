Subject: On logic and fuzziness
Message-ID: <161227042445.23782.752009708827984294.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

"Fuzzy logic" may be a useful concept in some, if not all, possible worlds,
but if you do not know the relevant languages that you are discussing, then
it is not a matter of fuzzy logic. It is simply fuzziness, with no logic
whatsoever.

What is the probability of one's being right about *anything* having to do
with Vedic or Avestan or Hittite, for example, if one does not know these
languages?

On this list, as opposed to others that Mark Hubey may be on, a preliminary
prerequisite is a basic command of the relevant languages. That is my
opinion, at least.

Of course, I may be wrong.
