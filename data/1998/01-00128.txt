Dear Subrahmanya,

would you happen to have any bibliographic references to the papers you are
referring to?

Anyway, thank you for an interesting attack on "my camp". I think you speak
for a lot of people in the sciences, and I think people in the humanities
are reaping the reward of years of neglected communication with people
outside their field. If such attacts can start a fresh round of
communication, nothing would be better.

Best regards,

Lars Martin Fosse
