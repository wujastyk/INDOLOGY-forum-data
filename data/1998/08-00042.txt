Search for a book by Swami Sahajananda Saraswati
Hello,
I'm having some difficulty locating a book by Swami Sahajananda Saraswati
titled "Brahmar.si-vam"sa-vistaara". Swami Sahajananda was a peasant
activist during the 1920s-50s who wrote extensively about the Bhumihar
Brahmans. In that context he talked of the Sarayuparin Brahmans, which is
what I am interested in.
I searched OCLC but could not find this title. I did, however, come across
his autobiography, titled "Meraa jiivana sa"nghar"sa". If anyone knows of
this text, or whether a particular library possesses a copy of it, I would
really appreciate being contacted.
Thank you.
Regards,
Anshuman Pandey
