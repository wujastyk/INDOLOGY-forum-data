Physical impediment, and fighting prowess, in Mahabharata
Dear Sarma!
        Actually I can't read Sanskrit--even if it's romanized. Also I figure
there's a font I'm lacking to be able to read your transcription as I think
it must have been intended. However, I can see from the Drono references
that you've sent me the right stuff--so thanks a lot! I'd best be off to
the library...
        Regards,
                Russ
