If the river had the name Haraxvaiti even in Iran where it is supposed
to be mighty river (vasiSTa remembers it as such!) how can you justify
the interpretation of the name as a river made up of ponds, not mighty and
disappearing? A mighty river could not have been given the name Haraxvaiti
which represents only a small river made up of ponds.
The word Vourukasha is very close to Bharukaccha (modern Broach). Does
this have any significance?
