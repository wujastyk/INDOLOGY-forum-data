Deciphering the Indua valley script
Dear List Members,
 Will somebody please point me to the latest in terms of decipherment of
the Indus Valley Script? I would like to have your ides and opinions on
the new( ~ 10 years old) theory about it's being related to Sanskrit.
May I also request for references and papers on the latest status as
regards the "Aryan Invasion Theory?"
 Looking forward to your replies and thanking you very much
Regards
Krishna
