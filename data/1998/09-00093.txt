Shangar
Dear Indologists:
I am researching vernacular words for adornment in Indian languages. The Sanskrit word shingar means both romantic love and adornment. In Gujarati the words are split and the word shangar (an apabrahmsa from the original Sanskrit) means adornment especially of a woman.
I would be grateful if anyone can let me know the equivalent of the Gujarati "shangar" in other languages.
