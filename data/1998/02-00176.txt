"Lord of animals" - Bibliography
Greetings!
An acquaintance of mine, Professor in Catholic Theology, is looking for
references/information about; "Lord of animals" (hope I got the right word
in english! in German: Herr der Tiere) in various religions and asked me,
if I could tell something about it from Indian context. I only know that
"Siva" is known as the Lord of Animals in Hindu mythology, and as a native
Telugu, know the story associated with the SreekALahasti (temple).
Could the list members please point any books/articles on: Siva as the
Lord of Animals. Please send a copy of your reply to the addresses given
below too!
Thanks in advance!
Regards,                --Sreenivas
P.S. The book: _For the Lord of the Animals_ by Heifetz and NarayanaRao
         Velcheru is only a translation of a Telugu "Sataka".
