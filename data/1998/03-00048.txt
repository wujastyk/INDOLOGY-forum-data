Indo-Aryan Invasion (focussed discussion)
I enthusiastically accept Jan Houben's additional proposals. Erdosy's
article is also crucial, and is probably already well-known to many members
of the list, as Hock's no doubt is.
I will also stop to think a bit before sending any more posts to the list.
Looking forward to the discussion that [it is hoped] will follow,
