The Great Tope of Manikyala
Isobel Shaw in _Pakistan Handbook_ (1989) reports that:
        "Manikalya Stupa is about two kilometers east of the main road
halfway between Mandra and Riwat. You can see it from the main road, but it
can easily be mistaken for a clump of banyan trees. A rough track leaves
the Grand Trunk Road on a corner a little way south of the radio masts and
crosses the railway to the stupa.
        "Manikalya Stupa is one of the largest in the area. The solid dome
supported on a square platform is still intact, but there are no carvings
or decorations left other than the simple pilasters ariound the drum, which
were restored in 1891.
        "You can climb the stupa from a break in the stone facing on the
east side and scramble to the grassy top for a good view over the plains
below. The deep hole in the top of the stupa was dug by treasure hunters,
who removed whatever relics and valuables it once held."
With best wishes,
