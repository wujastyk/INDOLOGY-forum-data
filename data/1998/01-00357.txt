the Cat
One more post-classical variation of the "Ascetic Cat" theme if represented
by a popular subject of Bengali "Bal-talar chhapapat" - printed (and then
hand-tinted) pat-s or pictures from Bal-tala, made in North Calcutta in the
last century. Such pictures are
called "Biraal-tapasvii" - and depict a cat masquerading as a sadhu - but
holding a fish in his teeth.
