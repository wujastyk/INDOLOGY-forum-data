Can anyone provide the text of a poem Tagore composed on the last day of
the 19th Century? The first line begins"The bloodred sun sets..." I have
seen it under the title "The Sunset of the Century" but suspect that was
assigned by an editor.

Any help would be appreciated. Please contact sconyerd at franklin.edu
