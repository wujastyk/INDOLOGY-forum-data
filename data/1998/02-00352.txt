Tamil words in English/AIT
Dear Prof. Sharma,
here is another belated answer:
This is perfectly true: There is no reason why a scholar should not take an
interest in matters outside his own field of scholarship. However: If you
do, you must learn the basics. Otherwise, the debate becomes a colossal
waste of time.
Again, perfectly true.
This is pretty much what I was trying to say. You don't necessarily need a
degree in math, but you need to know the relevant math.
Since history is written in this
Not at all. Provided he had read the relevant literature, he may of course
participate in the discussion. The problem with some persons who participate
in debates outside their (academic) ken, is that their qualifications do not
match the stringency of their voices. They talk nonsense, and not answering
nonsense, as you suggest, can be a dangerous policy too. Today's world is
full of nonsense: commercial nonsense, religious nonsense, political
nonsense. Much of it fairly harmless, but when e.g. a religious leader
manages to convince his flock to commit suicide collectively, the nonsense
is not harmless any more. Sometimes, it is the moral duty of knowledgable
people to speak up, even if it feels like a waste of time.
