Indo-Aryan im/e-migration (scholarly debate)
You're greatly overstating your case, since the idea that horses could
enter India through trade and such is quite possible. Also there is
nothing in particular that connects the earliest IE speakers with
horses.  Archaeological evidence suggests domesticated horses
originated in Central Asia, but it does not suggest the language of
the people who did the domesticating.  We also have no idea of what
language was spoken by the people who introduced horses to India,
if they were indeed introduced. The ancient Indian horse is genetically
different than the Central Asian horse.
However, the most important point is that the movement of horses or
any other domesticated animal does not imply the migration of people.
There are numerous examples of this in history. In fact, it happens
all the time today with new breeds of domesticated animals imported
from one country to the next.
