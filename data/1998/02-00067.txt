Indus/Sarasvati Doab
This refers to Michael Rabe's inquiry...
A beautiful map of the sites of the civilization (Mature Harappan
and--in the NW-late Kot Dijian cultures)is presented in Asko Parpola,
"Deciphering th Indus Script", Cambridge UP, 1994, p. 7. [This work is
also a veritable encyclopaedia on the script problem.]
I have attempted to superimpose the ancient courses of the
Sarasvati River on these sites, which run about 200 kms. south of and
parallel to the present-day course of the Sindhu river.
I assume that the India Today Article did not identify
all the 1200 sites on the banks of the Sarasvati.[see list in the URL
given below.] Rakhigarhi and Ganweriwala are sites as large in extent as
Mohenjodaro. Inscriptions were found in many sites in Gujarat, Kutch,
Sindh, Bahawalpur province,Sreeganganagar district, Haryana and Punjab.
Thanks to the superb and dedicated work of Parpola and Mahadevan,
almost all the inscriptions have been documented in corpuses. In
particular, the photographic corpuses of collections in Pakistan and India
released so far in two volumes are source material on the 'epigraphy' of
the civilization.
