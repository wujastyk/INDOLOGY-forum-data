It's not quite true, George, that the Indig. Aryan school has just pursued
a "just say no policy."  THere have been two pieces of 'positive' evidence
pertaining to the IVC/I-A connection that have often been brought forward
for whatever they are worth: a variety of reports of fire altars, most
especially at Kalibhangan, and the evidence of the 'Sarasvati.'  In my
opinion, the identification of these so-called fire altars  is not
compelling (although these were accepted by the Allchins) and so this
issue is not worth while discussing.  But the Sarasvati evidence is more
complex and does merit attention.

I have papers to finish grading and will be leaving town, but I would be
happy to discuss the evidence of the 'Sarasvati' upon returning if there
is interest.   Best,  Edwin
