Shankaracarya of the North
I just read V. Sundaresan's excellent account of this question on Indology.
Sorry if I repeated some things he said, and may have said better. I did
have a few details that he did not have, however, that might be integrated
into his account. One is that I had heard a few years ago that
Vishnudevananda Sarasvati expired and was succeeded by Vasudevananda
Sarasvati, which may account for VS's confusion over the names (cf. "Other
Claimants"). And I reiterate that Karpatri-ji was, according to my sources,
behind the lawsuits brought initially in 1955.
