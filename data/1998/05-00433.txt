Hindi Studies (fwd)
For distance learning of the Hindi Language Mr. Mohabeer may contact
the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. They have a program in
place where a class may be taught at Chapel Hill and at the State
University of North Carolina simultaneously. I do not know if this
resource could be tapped into and what the rules and regulations might be.
