One of Earliest excommunications from vedic religion
I am extremely sorry if I have offended any of the list members
by quoting the vishNu purANa passage. I tender an unconditional apology.
My intention in quoting the passage is simply out of curiosity and
purely academic. No political overtones are involved. The passage
actually occurs at the end of a chapter and could be an interpolation.
Earlier only haihayAs and tAlajaGghAs are mentioned as the enemies of
King Sagara and sakAs, yavanAs etc., are not listed among them. This
strengthens the suspicion that it could be an interpolation. But if it
iS NOT an interpolation, I was wondering whether vedic religion with
its caste system ever existed among the people mentioned at any time.
The purANic passage considers sakAs, yavanAs etc., to belong to the
vedic fold but later excommunicated (can be for political reasons).
I was wondering whether there was reference here to mithraic religion
of Middle east.
regards,
sarma.
