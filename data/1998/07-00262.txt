wheeled vehicles
Dear colleagues,
         participants of the recent discussion on horses, chariots, wheels etc.
will probably find some new useful information in an article written by a Russian
archaeologist now living in the USA:
        Yelena Izbitser. Wheeled vehicles and the home of the Indo-Europeans. -
Proceedings of the Seventh UCLA Indo-European Conference, Los Angeles, 1995.
Journal of Indo-European Studies, No. 27. 1998.
        The paper deals not with chariots, but with the earliest wheeled
vehicles: primitive wagons with disk-shaped wheels.
        Best wishes
                                        Yaroslav Vassilkov
