Frank Southworth in his article "Lexical Evidence for Early Contacts between
Indo-Aryan and Dravidian" says the following:
"There is also a possible connection between OIA pura- 'fortress, town' (RV
pur- 'stronghold') and the Dravidian verb pura- 'keep, protect, defend, etc.
(DED 3515)."
Has there been any discussion evaluating this suggestion vs. the IA cognates?
