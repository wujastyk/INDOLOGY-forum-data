        Sorry, I have mixed up your term with an older theory of blurred
sets (Fr. "ensembles flous").
        There are many attempts to give a theory of brain or computer
management, each one explaining or modelizing the other. That's very
interesting but, in my opinion, perhaps too early.
        Nevertheless, each science needs precursors, hence good luck!
        Regards,

PS: to Mr Subrahmanya:
OK, you exist and I apologize for my "proud pseudonym". And I stop here, I
need a nice cup of coffee ;-)
