Francois Bernier from France and Thomas Fryer from England visited India in the seventeenth- or eighteenth century.  As Thomas
was a physician and Francois was a natural philosopher, their travel accounts contain information on sciences in India.  I want
to read their travel accounts.  However, I cannot find the complete references of their works.  I wonder if the subscriber to
this list could provide me the information.
