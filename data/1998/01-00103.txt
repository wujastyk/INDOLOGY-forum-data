References on the authenticity of mAnasollAsa
I am looking for references on the authorship issue of the mAnasollAsa
ascribed to sureshvarAchArya. I have read the section on this work by
Karl Protter in the Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies. All
references given there are quite old (pre 1940). Any references not
given in Protter's book would be greatly appreciated. Also, is there a
critical edition of this text available? Thanks.
Rama.
