In support of Prof. Witzel's view on samudra-, I would like to quote
a latest work of another prominent modern Vedic scholar:

        "Waters on earth are rivers, their confluences (samudra-) - it
is a problem whether the RVic Aryans really knew of the sea or the ocean -
ponds, springs, etc."
        T.Y.Elizarenkova. The Concept of Water and the Names for It in the
Rgveda. - "Orientalia Suecana", vol. XLV-XLVI (1996-1997), Uppsala, p. 21.

        Best wishes to all,
                                        Ya.V.
