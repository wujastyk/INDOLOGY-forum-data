some op/old books on India & British India
Mr Stephen Feldman of Asian Rare Books has emailed me and phoned me (from
NY) to apologize for posting his booklist to our forum.  This was quite
inadvertent, and he is fully aware of the INDOLOGY policy of not including
advertisements.  I should like to thank him publicly for his words, and to
note for the record that he *is* a standing member of the list, and not a
hit-and-run spammer!
All the best,
Dominik
