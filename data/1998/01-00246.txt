A transgression?
As I have been reviewing the history of Vedic schoalrship and, especially,
benefitting from T. Elizarenkova's recent 'Language and Style of the Vedic
RSis', it is hard not to marvel and envy the wealth of scholarship from
the former Soviet Union which, to my youthful experience, has only
recently become readily accessible.
I ask this with some trepidation in light of the possible politics I could
be raising--and so apologize in advance as that is not my intent--but
nonetheless I am quite curious what discourse--if any--and on what topics
with the scholars of the former "eastern block" existed during the cold
war.  Further, did detente bring about a change, and if so where (topic
and author-wise) in Indology?  Perhaps the veterans in the field might
indulge this inquiry about the recent history -- prior, say, to 1975 -- of
our collective paramparaa?
Thank you in advance,

It is ludicrous to consider language as anything other
than that of which it is the transformation.
