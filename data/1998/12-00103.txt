Chin-sheng (688-740 AD), T'ang dynasty
Shu Hikosaka says:
"Chin-sheng (ChishO, 688-740 AD) of T'ang dynasty
has also mentioned about Malaya country is near
the Potalaka mountain which is the place of
Avalokitezvara."
Who is Chin-sheng? Any books, papers on him
in Chinese, Japanese or Western languages?
Thanks,
