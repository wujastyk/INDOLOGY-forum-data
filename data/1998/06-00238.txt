What is the current position of Vedic scholars with respect to the relative
dates of the text of the yajur veda vs the text of  RV and the relative dates
of the ideas in the YV vs ideas in the RV? I am interested in any updates of
Parpola's view that YV reflects a different tradition from RV, and "which
probably evolved in the Punjab and was incorporated in the Veda only during
the acculturation that may be assumed to have taken place after the descent of
the Rgvedic tradition from the Swat Valley." What are the possible dates for
the origin of agnicayana?
