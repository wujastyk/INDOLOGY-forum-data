BUDDHIST REJECTION OF MUSIC
Please check first of all in the Pali Vinaya in English -- I do not have a
copy at hand, but there is a rule against seeing various performances,
dance, music etc. However, there is an exception to this (although perhaps
not in the Pali -- I don't remember) for performances at stupas. this has
been discussed in detail by Sasaki Shizuka (alas, in Japanese). Anyway, the
Vinaya stuff is the place to start, and perhaps that will answer your
question, since of course it is the Pali vinaya which is appealed to in
Thailand.
