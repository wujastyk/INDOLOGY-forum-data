Indian children born abroad -- RSS and Vivekananda
I thought I already said it was in his collection of letters. It is
published in Bengali by the Ramakrishna Vedanta Society of Calcutta. This
particular letter was written by Vivekananda to one Mr. Sarfraz Hossain.
As far as Vivekananda's socialist leanings, I would ask you to read
Bhupendranath Dutta's and Sister Nivedita's writings on SV. They are the
two closest people SV had. Both Bhupendranath and Nivedita wrote in English.
As far as RSS' interpretation of SV (and other distortions of Indian
history and religions), the less we talk, the better.
