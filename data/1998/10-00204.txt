C-DAC's new multilingual editor
C-DAC has released a new multilingual editor whose freeware version is
called iLeap Lite. For one thing the key board layout for any language
can be kept right in front of your eyes on the monitor screen and charecters
can be typed either on the keyboard or by klicking the letters on the keyboard
layout on the screen with the mouse. The english/indic language toggle is
now ScrollLock instead of CapsLock in the previou version. e-mails
can be sent through Leap.
regards,
sarma.
