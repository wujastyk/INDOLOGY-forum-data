Horses

In our discussions about the Aryan-Invasion/Immigration-Theory a series of
both linguistic and archaeological arguments have been brought forward. It
seems to me that ideological arguments so far have been neglected. If you
have a look at the vocabulary of the Rgveda, you will find that the horse
plays a very prominent part in it, a fact that already would point to its
ideological relevance even before you start reading the texts. Not only the
word azva is used about 200 times (not to mention hari and other words for
horse), there are also more than 30 derivatives from and compounds with
azva! The Indus seals, on the other hand, often depict other animals, but -
as far as I know - not the horse. If we assume that the seals to a certain
degree reflect religious concepts, the absence of the horse is highly
significant, especially if we compare it with the high position of the
horse in other Indo-European cultures. Therefore - even if some horse-bones
should be found in the Indus culture - the horse does not seem to have
played any prominent role in the minds of its people. This makes a very
strong contrast to Vedic culture as reflected in the Rgveda. For me the
horse-argument still has much weight, in spite of the counterarguments that
have been brought forward up to now.
