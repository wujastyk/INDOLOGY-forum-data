Request for information
I am looking to purchase a copy of "siddhanta zirOmaNi", the mathematics
text by Bhaskara II, I am particularly interested in the Lilavati
section. Ideally, I would like to get hold of a version that has the
Sanskrit original with an English or Telugu translation. I would
appreciate any help in locating this.
Thanks,
Bapa Rao
