Well, yes and no. I'm more inclined to doubt only the current form of
the anupallavi, instead of the entire composition.
I seem to remember renditions from Madurai Mani Iyer and S. Ramanathan
as daitya hitopadeSam, but if SSP says otherwise, fine, that is
Aptavacana.
And yes, musical criteria and grammar may lead to different conclusions.
If the only argument about the kRtis on rAhu and ketu is that they are
not included in the SSP, that sounds valid enough to me. However, the
authenticity of these two compositions has also been recently doubted,
purely on the basis of mistakes in language usage, especially in the one
on ketu. But I couldn't find any obvious errors. Moreover, if the
presence of jyotisha/mantra lore is evidence of dIkshitar's authorship,
then the compositions on rAhu and ketu seem to pass the test. So, if
these two were not composed by muttusvAmi dIkshitar, we cannot say that
a later composer was not learned in jyotisha and mantra SAstras. I guess
the status of the compositions on rAhu, ketu and Sukra mirrors that of
the demons and their guru!
