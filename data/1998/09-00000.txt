epic marriage
*        But vasudeva, the subhadra's father was the brother of kuntI,
the
*arjuna's mother, and hence the wife and husband were very close
relatives.
*        Is such a marriage (between first crossed cousins) a legal one?
*       If not, the fact that zUra (biological father of subhadrA and
*kRSNa) gave his just born daughter to kuntibhoja, son of his paternal
aunt,
*making him the legal father of kuntI, could make the marriage to be
legal
*(between third cousins)?
*       I summarize:
*(biological)
*zUra > kuntI > arjuna
*zUra > vasudeva > subhadrA
*(official)
*X > a woman > kuntibhoja > kuntI > arjuna
*X > citraratha > zUra > vasudeva > subhadrA
    The official marriage is very legal in the "Dravidian
kinship" system.
For a full analysis of this marriage pattern and
earlier study by Henry Morgan, et al., (I have read
that Iroquois Indians, australian tribes, .. also follow this)
