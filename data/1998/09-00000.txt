*        But vasudeva, the subhadra's father was the brother of kuntI,
the
*arjuna's mother, and hence the wife and husband were very close
relatives.
*        Is such a marriage (between first crossed cousins) a legal one?
*       If not, the fact that zUra (biological father of subhadrA and
*kRSNa) gave his just born daughter to kuntibhoja, son of his paternal
aunt,
*making him the legal father of kuntI, could make the marriage to be
legal
*(between third cousins)?

*       I summarize:
*(biological)
*zUra > kuntI > arjuna
*zUra > vasudeva > subhadrA
*(official)
*X > a woman > kuntibhoja > kuntI > arjuna
*X > citraratha > zUra > vasudeva > subhadrA

    The official marriage is very legal in the "Dravidian
kinship" system.
For a full analysis of this marriage pattern and
earlier study by Henry Morgan, et al., (I have read
that Iroquois Indians, australian tribes, .. also follow this)

Thomas Trautmann, Dravidian kinship, Univ. Michigan press
