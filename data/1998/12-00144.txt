What you wish to see or do not wish to see does not make any difference
to me. I have a right to say what I want to say.

This has absolutely no relevence. In your eagerness to denigrate Swamiji
you do not even notice the asbsurdity of your argument. In S.A. there
was political & economic coercion. Swamiji did not and cannot coerce
independent Americans.

And finally I will give you one example.

A person who is venerated by many as son of god said

"But he answered, and said, it is not meet to take the chidren's bread,
and to cast it to dogs." Matthew 15.26

The dogs in the above statement are Canaanites.

Do you call Jesus racist. (I do not.)

Do you call him a child of his times and not ahead of his times.
( I do not.)

sarma.
