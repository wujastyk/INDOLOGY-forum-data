An old question
To save bandwidth, I am not quoting any of the two previous messages.
The concept of ``mother tongue'' or ``first language'' is problematic
for early bilinguals. And the cases where the dominant (in terms of
variety and frequency of use) lanuage changes over time or is not
the language spoken at home are common enough that some books on
bilingualism avoid the two terms in quotes.
