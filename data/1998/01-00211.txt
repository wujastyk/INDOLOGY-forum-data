aage naath ...
Mr. Jay Thakar's reply is slightly off.
aage -- in front
naath -- nose rope
na -- not
piiche -- behind
pagahaa -- tail rope, or tether
When the nose rope is on, the ox is led around and is not tied down "at
home".
My handy-dandy _saahityik muhaavaraa-lokokti ko"s_, by Harivamsh Ray Sharma,
defines this proverb as:
"sa.msaar me.m akelaa honaa" to be alone in the world, and as:
"koii sagaa-sambandhii na honaa" to have no friend or relation
Then he gives an example from Renu.
sevaa me.m,
