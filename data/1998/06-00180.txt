Draft transliteration scheme on the Web
An aditional reason in favour of z-subdot is how early Skt borrowings are
represented in Tamil, e.g. u.sa: u.zai, se:.sa- :ce:.zam. Phonetically a
voiced counterpart of IndoA .s is not far off the mark of PDr or Ta. .z. I
published a longish paper on the developments of PD *.z as early as 1958
(Indian Linguistics, Turner Jubilee Volume). PD *.z becomes .l, .d, .r, r,
in most lgs.Toda also has .s and s(wedge-supra)beside the above. Being a
frictionless continuant, it leads to y and 0 also. The amjor advantage is to
match it with other retrofexes and .z eminently suits this. l-macr-b is ill
suited and is not used by scholars like like zvelebil. Bh.K.
