We can probably see that "The man" in sentence (b) does not function as a
dative, and that (b) is not the exact syntactic equivalent of the German
sentence (b) by substituting an appropriate personal pronoun for "The man":
(b') He was given a book by a friend.
By contrast, if we substitute an appropriate personal pronoun for "the man"
in (a), we get:
(a') A friend gave him a book.
or
(a'') A friend gave a book to him.
When we now look back at (a) and (b), it is easier to see that the dative
or indirect object "the man" in (a) is raised to nominative or subject in
(b).
(Please pardon some terminological imprecision here; it is years since I
have studied generative grammar, etc.).
