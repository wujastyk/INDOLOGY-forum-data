Is the Aryan Invasion a Myth?

Voice of India is a publishing house run largely by the Sangh Parivar (RSS,
VHP, BJP, etc.) that preaches Hindutva (i.e., Hindu supremacist doctrines).
The Sangh Parivar has always been against the theory of Aryan invasion, not
on the basis of historical evidences, but on the basis of ideological
beliefs.
These beliefs have often made other presumptions such as the "hypothesis"
that Taj Mahal was built by a Hindu king and not by Mughal emperor
Shah-Jehan. Even a conservative historian such as Dr. Ramesh Chandra
Mazumdar was outraged by such presumptions.
