attachment and detachment
Just a short note to say that the problem of attachment seems to have been
conquered.  I must admit that I have had a problem of attachment and
duality with Dr. Fosse's messages, but we seem to have mastered the art of
action without attachment, since the last message from Dr. LMF came to me
(and others I assume) "anaasakta" and "nirdvandva".
