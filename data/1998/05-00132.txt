According to some arguments, the domesticated horse originated with
Indo-Europeans of Central Asia. I tend to think it originated with
the Altaic peoples of Central Asia.  However, either way, I don't
think one must surmise that every where the domesticated horse is
found involves migrations of either Altaic or IE peoples.  For example,
China, Korea, Japan and Southeast Asia.  Some scientists believe the
domesticated chicken originated in Southeast Asia, but that it spread
at least partly, in an indirect fashion to other parts of the world.
Yes, this is exactly what I mean.
