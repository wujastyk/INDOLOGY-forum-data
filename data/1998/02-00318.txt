John Ross Carter has published an article:

'Music in the Theravaada Buddhist heritage: in chant, in song, in Sri
Lanka' in _On Understanding Buddhists: Essays on the Theravaada
Tradition in Sri Lanka_ (Albany, NY: SUNY, 1993), 133-52.

The starting point of this article is the story of how Sakka (who wants
to approach the Buddha who is absorbed in meditaion) first requests the
gandabbha Pa~ncasikha to charm the meditating Buddha with his vii.naa
and song (Sakkapa~nha Sutta, D II 263ff).
