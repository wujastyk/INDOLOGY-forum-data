Precisely because he professes un-Indian, Iranian ideas: I mentioned some
of them last time:  ....  Last time, I forgot his special relation with
Varuna in RV 7 86-88. A much more personal relationship of the poet and a
god (Varuna) than most of the RV. reminds of Zoroaster again (and Varuna =
"Asura Medha", has often been thought to have been the model for Zor's
Ahura Mazda)

No. There are indications of Iranian words in the RV, such as in RV 8.
Both languages and religions are very close. After several weeks in either
'country" you could understand the local language easily, but maybe not
speak it grammatically correctly. All of this is well known.

The Old Iranian of the older Avesta (Zarathustra's Gatha-s) is
linguistically hardly younger than the RV. Absolute dating has not been
established, though. But there are a few tantalizing hints (the YOUNG
Avestan name of Bactria in the Atharvaveda, for ex.)

Of corse not. But I had to point out that *something* is going on in
Vasistha's hymns: the proof passage for the "great Saravati".  His
Sarasvati line does not fit the contemporary one of Visvamitra in 3.33!!!

That still as to be explained.

But we can see enough from their seals and tablets. They do not fit
*Rgvedic* religion.  A deity wrestling with 2 lions? A deity killing a
buffalo?  A deity wrestling a buffao? etc.   Not in RV

> 2. We dont really know much about the culture of the Aryans either.
We know a great deal, from the RV and the Avesta. Their family system,
tribal system, their material cultue, their animals, their (little)
agriculture, their deities, their rituals, their poetics, their language,
etc.

That has changed wit the finds in Bactria-Margiana and Baluchistan.
Now their is a *trail*, see Hiebert in Erdosy, Indo_Aryans of Ancient
South Asia, 1995. Plus the Gandhara grave culture, plus Swat.  All
starting about 1880/1700 BC., and after the destruction of the Bactrian
horizon about 2100 BC.

Not little. We can more or less reconstruct their Soma, Animal, Pravargya,
Horse and Fire rituals right from the Rv. Plus a lot of mythology. Add the
Avesta with very similar data.

> 4. We also know that there is a cultural continuity in the SIVC.

yes, but at what level? - The great Indus cities, their script and long
their distance overland trade disappeared... All cultural traits continue
at much reduced scale. But, in the post_Indus age we also have NEW items:
cremation and burial in urns (as described in the Vedic texts) replaced
burial of bodies in the ground. Already Vats in c.  1930 has pointed out
the curious birds (with minute human bodies inside!) painted on Cemetary H
cremation urns, -- which fits Vedic ideas about movement of souls after
death...  But the *style* of these paintings (thus artisans, lower level,
small tradition) continues, is in Indus style. The ideas are new -- and
fit Vedic texts. This is little discussed in arch. these days.
Archaeoogists would have to read Vedictexts --- and therefore my
cooperation with R. Meadow...

> So how can one postulate a migration ???

The texts themselves speak of it many times, even in RV;  and the RV
remembers places and tribes in Afghanistan, Iran and even beyond: The
Rasaa = Avestan Ranghaa = Scythian *Rahaa (written Rhaa in Greek), where
it designates ... the Volga.

Yes, and that is powerful evidence which has not been disproved by
anyone so far. S.S. Misra has tried, recently, but that is a very long and
"interesting" chapter...

Copper (mined, smelted, worked on) does not go back to,  say, 5000 BC.

I would have to see exactly which kind of copper objects... I mentioend
the bead at Mehrgarh at an even much earlier date. But this does not mean
copper smelting + regular usage....
