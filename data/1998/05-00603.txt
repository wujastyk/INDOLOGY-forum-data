It would depend on the program, of course! In this case, the program seemed
well documented, it was a popular, but "scientific" exposition of the early
geological and natural history of Meso-America and the Indies with a bit of
history and ethnography thrown in. But I DO mention that it is TV, which
means that I am not *entirely* confident. The underlying assumption is, of
course, that there are so many shisthas out there on Indology net that a
couple of them might know more about this and correct me if I am wrong. (I
don't HAVE to be right all the time, I am quite happy to be wrong sometimes :-))
But wouldn't it be a point here that most - if not all - of these migrations
started not long before or after writing had been invented? Anyway, my point
was this: Migrations are sometimes remembered, sometimes not. The fact that
the early Aryans had little or no memory of their migrations into India
therefore proves very little.
