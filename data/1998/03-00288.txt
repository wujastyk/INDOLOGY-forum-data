Indo-Aryan im/e-migration: Horse argument
In response to Mary Storm's useful summary:
Much of this evidence was discussed on the RISA list back, I think, in
October 1996. One could check the archives for specific references, but I
recall that archaeologists had not come to a consensus about these possible
horse remains at that time. Is this right, Edwin?
