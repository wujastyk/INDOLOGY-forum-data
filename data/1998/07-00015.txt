So, as an example of a secondary/subordinate meaning, we should understand
"Panjabis [?] are dull like oxen" (or singular), rather than the pleonastic
(or tautological?) "oxen are oxen".  Is this correct? (I could not find
exactly this in Patanjali, but this seems to be the explanation in
ParibhASenduzekhara 15 -- is this correct?
