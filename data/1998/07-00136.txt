CDIAL #4827 *cilla-2 'unctuous, shining'
Pk. cillaa- cilliya 'shining'; Sindhi cilo 'pancake' ... Nepali cillo
'greasy, smooth, polished', substantive 'grease, ghee', Hindi cilaknaa 'to
be bright', cilcilaanaa 'to be very hot (of the sun)'

I would guess that 'shine, be bright' is the unifying meaning. Fresh rotis
shine when brushed with ghee.

When my eye wandered to CDIAL 4466 *ghaana 'mill', I noticed a Marathi word
ghaavan 'stone mortar'. I don't know Marathi, or exactly what sort of
mortar this is. That said, please accept the wild guess of a possible
connection.
