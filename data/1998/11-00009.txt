    Works absolutely fine for me perhaps because I have both sans12.ttf font and Xdvng installed. 
    I wish TYPING in Devanagari was that simple because all available software seems to be unable to recognise that some people do not type on American or English language keyboards. I use a French keyboard and sure enough I have to guess where to find the anuswara and the like because all indications in the manual are wrong !! This is very frustrating indeed. 
    If anybody has a bright idea how to solve that problem I will be very grateful
