Dear Member,
A possible source of knowing how old such illustrations are is the
illustrated manuscripts preserved in Indological institutes such as the
Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute of Pune. Dr Dominic Wujastic who
is
in charge of such a collection may be able to throw light on this topic.
I
have myself seen illustrated Mss of other works (e. g. the Bhaagavata
Puraana), if not of the Giitaa, which are fairly old. I do not find
anything neo-Hindu in the pictures you have referred to.

 How old are the mss.? 13th century?? 16th century??
 Any guesses?

 Thanks,
 N. Ganesan
