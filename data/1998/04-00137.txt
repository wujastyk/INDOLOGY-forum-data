Somebody has followed a pattern rigidly does not mean that muddusvAmi
dIkSitar (sorry, but that is his name as given in SSP) is obliged to
follow it. muddusvAmi dIkSitar was breaking many traditions of his time.
He composed mainly in sanskrit when most of the composers including his
father and brothers composed mainly in telugu. He composed many kritis
without anupallavi.

Further sambOdhana at the end for a slOkA comes
naturally and is a matter of convenience. For a kriti it may not be
necessary.

sarma.
