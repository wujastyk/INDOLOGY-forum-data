The reference occurs in Thomas Babington Macaulay's famous Minute on English
Education in India dated 2nd February 1835. You will find the Minute in the
collected works of Macaulay. It is true he made very derogatory remarks
about the contents of classical (Sanskrit) literature in India. We ignore
this arrogance born out of his ignorance. But the Minute is a brilliaant
document and is very prophetic. Regards.
