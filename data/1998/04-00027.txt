Thanks for the ref. This must be be classified as a journal, for
I could not find it in worldcat.
There is also Sparreboom's ``Chariots in the Veda'' and some
material in Rau's ``altertumskunde'' (I don't have the precise
details handy). I avoided mentioning them because they start
from assumptions about construction of chariots then proceed to
interpret the textual data. I have reservations about some of these
assumtions. I had intended to write to Sparreboom and Littauer
about some of these, but never did. I want to do that before I
talk about them.
