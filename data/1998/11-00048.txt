SV: Paired Horse and PIE breakup
 Yes, Dr. Fosse's point is well-taken. But, Littauer
 calls these to be 'proto' chariots. True chariots
 are only 1800 B.C.  Sintashta chariots are evolving
 towards true ones. So, the archaelogical finds
 can at best go back few centuries before 2000 B.C.
 (say 2500 B.C.)
