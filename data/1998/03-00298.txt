etymology of karN
S. Palaniappan answered me:
        You're perhaps right.
        But what is "very satisfactory"? Personnally, I'm "normally"
satisfied by this IE analysis where the only problem is the supposed
assimilation *kol-no- > *qol-no- which would need a proof. Usually, such a
proof needs two parts:
        - phonetic: it must be acceptable regarding general rules. That's
here the case: the "l" sound is known to have a labial feature (see in
ancient French the evolution chivals > chivaus which give the modern
irregular plural cheval/chevaux) and the "o" being also labial is able to
inforce the process of anticipation.
        - other examples of such a treatment: finding a specific groupment
of phonems attested in the specific languages is not always easy, but here
we can consider the old high German "klagOn" (to moan, complain, giving
German "klagen") which is coming from a *galgh-. If we accept (not a
difficulty) a semantic comparison with Skr. "garhati", "gRhuH" we have our
example of labialization (*gva > ga but *ga > ja). Unfortunately, the two
well known roots *kel- (to hide) and *gleubh- (to carve, sculpt, bark,
hollow) are not attested in Sanskrit and we are limited to one example.
        Do YOU are "very satisfied"? "normally"? not?
        I, normally :)
        What is the opinion of other Eurindian linguists on the list?
        Alas, I'm strictly unable to comment your own hypothesis on the
word, completely out of my competence.
