Yes, but [s.] _is_ "sh"...  Unless there are two or more contrasting
kinds of shibilants in a language, it doesn't really matter if the
sound is described/realized as palato-alveolar (laminal
post-alveolar) [s^], alveolo-palatal (palatalized/domed
post-alveolar) [s'] or retroflex (apical/flat post-alveolar or
sub-apical/sub-laminal palatal) [s.].  They are all allophones of the
same basic shibilant sound /S/.
It was only when *k^ became /s'/ (laminal/domed post-alveolar) in
Sanskrit that ruki-/S/ became the retroflex (apical/flat
post-alveolar) phoneme /s./.  Same as in Polish or Mandarin Chinese
or Ubykh.
Nonsense: English, Swedish, Sardo, Asturian, Polish and Russian are
`real European IE' and have retroflex sounds.
