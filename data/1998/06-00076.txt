understood what's going on could fill those in. Just to make sure that
there's no ambiguity let us agree to use asterisks on reconstr. in which
*ai/*aai/*au/*aau are used, nothing for transcriptions and [...] for
the phonetics. Thus e/ai/o/au are reflexes (resp.) of *ai/*aai/*au/*aau
and today are pronounced [e:]/[ai]/[o:]/[au].
So, we have in (the written recension/modern recitation of) some Vedic
texts zre3STha 'best', and zre3STha < *zrai'iSTHa < *zraiHiSTha on com-
parative grounds.
The question is: what was the pronunciation of what e3 stands for, at the
time those texts were composed?
If I understand what you're saying, the pluti-ness of the e must be a relic
in the modern recitation of an original [ai'i] pronunciation. But if that's
the case I'm lost. Why couldn't it be the relic of a [e:'i] pronunciation?
