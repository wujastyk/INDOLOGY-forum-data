In Andhra Pradesh there is a tradition of calling natural as well as
manmade large irrigational lakes as 'samudram'. Examples are
1. Chilka Samudram
2. Tippa  Samudram
3. Anatasagaram
5. Pillalamarri Samudram
6. Chounda Samudram
7. Eraka Samudram
8. Nama Samudram
9. Bacha Samudram
10. Ganapa Samudram
11. Prola Samudram
12 Tamma Samudram
13. Udayaditya Samudram
But this does not prove anything because we do not know whether such
tradition of calling lkakes as 'samudram' existed in the RV times.
