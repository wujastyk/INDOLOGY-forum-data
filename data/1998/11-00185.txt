PIck up my paper on the topic on my web site. That is for exact matches.

With a semantic shift of N, and a phonetic similarity/shift of M, the
average number is N*M times the calculations shown in my paper and my
book. Since the average is 1. The average, providing "leeways", is
simply
about multiplying this number by some constant. One way is N*M as I
showed above. I am sure that everyone can do multiplication, even you.

high as yours, but certainly not by me :-)

I know more about probability theory than sophomore level combinations
and permutations.

Little bit more sarcasm, even if only to prove that you are upset about
something quite serious.
