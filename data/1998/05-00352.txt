There was a geological study at Kalibangan that found  the
sedimentary layer of the Yamuna extended 11 meters deeper than
at present.  The sendiment was deposited at an estimated rate of
2 meters per thousand years, so the oldest level before a drying out
period was about 5.5 thousand years ago.  Dr. Kalyanaraman probably
has more details.
