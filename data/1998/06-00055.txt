The south Asian bombs and RV date problem
In reply to these remarks of S. Kalyanaraman:
Briefly, let me tell you what my method is:
I read the Rgveda as much as I can. I study its grammar, its poetics, its
world-view -- from as many points of view as possible. I compare it to
traditions that are known to be related to it, starting with Avestan, and
other Indo-European traditions. I read scholarship that places the RV
within the Indic linguistic area. When I sense similarities with more
remote cultures, I study those similarities too. I make regular effort to
THINK about the RV in as many ways as I can conceive. But I try always to
be faithful to the text.
I do not consider my knowledge of the RV "subjective." I consider it the
product of many years of study of that text. As for the Indo-Aryan
migration/emigration controversies, my method is very simple, and very
limited in its scope:
If a given position does not agree with what I know of the RV I reject it.
If it agrees, I entertain it.
I try to keep my mouth shut when I know that I don't know a given topic.
Best wishes,
George Thompson
