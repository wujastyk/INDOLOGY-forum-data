Is the Aryan Invasion a Myth?
The Aryan migration theory, and other theories have recently been discussed
on this list, though the discussion recently seems to have slowed down.
Please visit the Indology List archives at
http://listserv.liv.ac.uk/archives/indology.html. I recall that the recent
discussion began in July or August (although it may have begun earlier),
and continued into early November. Earlier stages of discussions of Aryan
migration into India, versus indigenous Aryans in India, may probably be
found further back in the archives.
