Exceptions do not invalidate rules. DEDR 3398. In the case of Ta. tuvaR-:
tu:R-, there is no guarantee that the underlying V2 was a and not i or
u.Here the ultimate root seems to be *tum- which occurs in a closed syllable
(cf. Tel. tumpara, tuppara); Tamil has tum-i 'drizzle'. The order of change
was *tum-V- >*tuw-V- > tu:-. If you go through the DED or DEDR you can see
scores of cases where the quality of the formative vowel is variable; since
I showed contrasts mik-al >me:l, but mik-u >mi: type, the uderlying form
wherever there is V1 lengthened without changing its quality, the suffix
vowel has got to be a high vowel; thus Telugu nivuRu > ni:Ru is better
explained than taking Ta. nivaRu and saying that the rule is invalidated.You
need to judge the other cases in the same light. There are several
etymologies given in TVB 40 years ago which need to be changed. Please note
there was no DED when I worked out these etymologies.
        In reconstruction we set up intermediate stages on the basis of
established correlations or patterns, e.g. pesar > peyar > pe:r; similarly
mosaru > *moyar (no where attested) > mo:r (DEDR 4902)(Ta.has mocar, mo:r,
Ma. mo:r,Ko. Ka. have the c/s forms); in terms of natural phonology, without
the intermediate y form, you cannot have contraction. Since it is not
attested you cannot call the rule is invalid.
(ko.c-) to be hot; Tu. kAyuni to be hot; Go. kAsAnA to become hot.
Go. ka:s is a restuctured stem from the past ka:si:, just like Modern Telugu
has ka:s-tu:; I discussed elsewhere how the roots have incorporated tense
morphemes and got restructured. (Also discussed in TVB); in the case of koy
what you find in parenthese are past stems with c/t in Sandhi. Kota koy-t
in Kur-Malto.
Telugu also has kuyyo: moRRo:; This root kuy- is related to PD *ku: 'crow,
cry, shout, call' etc. How in the world can it be the basis of kuy-awa..
'potter'
on this root?
This I must say is imagination running riot; not the science of etymology.
Thanks.
