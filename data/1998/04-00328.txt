This clear division between human-divine and human-society is a quite
modern thing, not only in India but also elsewhere in the world. As an
aside, it should be clear that the failure to bring about this
distinction between "church" and state in modern Indian democracy is a
key factor behind the contemporary Indian political ferment. In any
case, the relationship between humans and divine powers is a very
important consideration in traditional Indian constructions of society.

Leaving aside modern arguments for and against the death penalty,
medhAtithi operates in a world where the king and his court combine the
legislative, executive and judiciary functions of government. Moreover,
the king is the earthly representative of a divine power. Add to this
the mImAmsA notion of apUrva, and how it brings about the fruit of
ritual acts, and medhAtithi's views on the punishment of criminals don't
seem simplistic after all.
