Is the Aryan Invasion a Myth?

 Despite sustained archaeological searches, NO horse
 remains or equipment have been found in IVC dating prior to
 1700 B.C. In about 4000 Indus seals, found in a wide
 area for about a century by archaeologists, horse is
 NOT depicted. On the other hand, Aryans and horses
 go hand in hand in the Rigveda.
 Linguistics points to the entry of Sanskrit into India
 and not the other way around. The Indigenous Aryan school
 is not able to dislodge this so far.
