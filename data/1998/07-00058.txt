You are right. I did not give A and B as English equivalents of the
Tamil sentences unconditionally. It was prefaced with the clause, "if 1)
is not an active construction," etc. Since as the Tamil sentence,
"ta.n.nIr to.t.tiyil nirampiyatu" is in fact in the active voice, your
construction A' is correct.

Well, I'm used to writing what can be called technical English writing,
using almost 100% passive sentences, for purposes of scientific
publications. I've probably seen and used hundreds of sentences like A.
To my ears, A conveys a different meaning from A'. "Water was filled in
the tank" implies that a human being did this action. "Water filled in
the tank" implies that this happened of its own accord, or due to
non-human agency, e.g. due to rain or some such reason.
