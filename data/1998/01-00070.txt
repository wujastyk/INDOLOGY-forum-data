Here are the stanzas from MBh. describing Uttara kurus in the sabhA parvA.
There are some in bhISma parvA also where the longevity of the people there
is mentioned.

Though it starts with "uttaraM kuruvarSaM", in the last two slokAs the
reference is to a city. Perhaps the capital also is called Uttarakuru
puraM. This tallies with Ptolemy's description of Ottorokoro as city.
