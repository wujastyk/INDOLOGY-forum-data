There are two points related to semantic distance here: about semantics of
Vedic vahati (drives?) and Dadhyan~c.
Is the decapitation of Dadhyan~c and transplant attested in the Rigveda? Why
can't it be interpreted literally in the context of materials used in the
yajn~a, such as lacto products.
The dha_tu, vah moves extraordinary semantic distances in lexemes such as
nirva_ha, prava_ha. Based on the entire corpus of vah-based words, why can't
we deduce that the proto-semantics of this root were more connected with
'moving' than with 'carrying'or 'driving'? In Tamil, va_ku means: attitude? I
think this is a classic instance of the tough problem of measuring semantic
distances, so long as motion was integral to an animate being from times
immemorial, even in the pre-lithic states of evolution.
