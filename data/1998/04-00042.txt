Madhva's bhashya on the BS
Does anyone on this list know of -- or even better, own -- an acceptable
English translation of Madhva's Brahmasutrabhashya? No such translation
seems to be available from Swedish university libraries. I particularly need
the commentary on the first sutra (+ introductory remarks, if any, by
Madhva). Thanks in advance!
Best regards,
Martin Gansten
