Romani
Quoted from Encyclopaedia Britannica (?):
Does Romani really appear far "apart from the original Indian stock" in all
the examples cited above to illustrate this point?
Isn't "doshman" a cognate of Vedic *durmanman* and Epic Skt. *durmanas* and
Homeric (and later) Greek *dusmenEs*?
see Homeric *dromos* = running, race, race-course; see Vedic and later Skt.
roots *dru* (*drav-a-ti*) and *drA* and *dram*
