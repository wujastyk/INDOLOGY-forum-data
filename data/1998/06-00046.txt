Sure....satanic mythology is the cause of all this "blindness"
and evil influence on Indian politicians and people.
On the day of judgement, these heathen will answer for their sins.

Since the world began in 4004BC(November?),
the world should have ended after 6000 years i.e in 1995 or 1996
(depending on whethar you want to count the year zero in or not).

God is probably running a little late -
maybe He is using the Indians to quickly fulfill what has been predicted.

Anyway, your spin was pretty convincing, some even fell for it. :)
