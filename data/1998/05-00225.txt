You are right about the place, although it is not directly connected
with the Shang dynasty.  However, regarding the Xinkiang mummies,
this appear to be more hype than anything else. Some studies on
crania in Xinkiang have followed the same erroneous path as the
interpretation of the Kennewick remains.  That is, they have
interpreted anything that doesn't fit into typical northeast
Mongoloid as "Caucasoid" or "Pre-Caucasoid."  Most of the remains
associated with Xinkiang and also the Siberian "Caucasoids" are
related to modern Southern Mongoloid/Pacific  types that once were very
common  in Northeast and Central Asia.  In fact, Shang remains,
especially the earliest ones, often resemble "Oceanic Negroids" more than
anything else

Regarding blonde mummies, even such mummies were found in Peru.
Unfortunately, what many of these archaeologists do not say is that
mummification can change the color of hair.

There is an old study by Virchow that explained that salts, a common
material in mummification, tends to cause blondness in dead hair. He
was examining specifically pre-dynastic Egyptian remains that had
been sun-dried and exposed to soil with high salt content.
