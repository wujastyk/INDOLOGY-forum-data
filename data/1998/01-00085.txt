Sindhi sailing vessels
Dear members of the list,
I am looking for publication(s) giving a general description of Sindhi
sailing vessels of the traditional type.
So far I have been able to find only one reference:
Zur geschichtlichen Bedeutung der fr?hen Seefahrt. (Schlingloff 1982, in:
Kolloquien zur Allgemeinen und Vergleichenden Arch?ologie, M?nchen, Verlag
C. H. Beck, 2 vols., pp. 51-85).
is not available in any of the countries cooperating with our library.
Could anyone suggest something else that might be available, that would
provide the required information? I need only a general description and not
detailed technical information.
Or failing that, does any library in Germany provide the service of
photocopying and mailing articles contained in German publications? I would
of course be happy to pay the required charges.
Thank you, and with best wishes,
Ruth Schmidt
