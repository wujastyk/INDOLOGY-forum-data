Columbia book on Indian poetry ??
What happened to the Columbia book of Indian poetry project?
Now that Barbara S. Miller is gone.
There are Columbia book of Chinese poetry, Columbia book
of later Chinese poetry etc.,
It will be great if a few volumes on Indian poetry are
brought out.
Is there an encyclopaedia of Sanskrit literature, with a page
or so on each of the important works. Similar encyclopaedias
on other Indian languages are desirable too.
There are encyclopaedias on virtually anything,
except things Indian.
