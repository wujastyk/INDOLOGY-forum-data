Ancient Geography (+transcription)
Dear Indologist
First of all I am sorry for the transcription. But I am using Sanskrit
transcription from Taiwan. Can somebody please send me the transcription of
devanagari used in this list.
For some years I am trying to translate Lan%ka^vata^ra su^tra from the 4th
century Chinese translation. Since I have seen the discussion on some
ancient geography here  I would like to ask about a place where the sutra
suppose to take place.
In the most of the manuscripts it is mentioned as
lan%kagiri in the malaya kingdom
and is some commentarries it is mentioned as
malayagiri in the malaku^t!a kingdom
In some latter translations from 6th and 7th century author of the
Lan%ka^vata^ra says that his father is Praja^pati, his mather Vasumati, his
name is Viraja and he is from the Ka^tya^yana race born in Campa.
I found that  forest called the Malaya mountains is mentioned in Nagananda
I do not know whether it is the same place, since no word about Lan%ka is
there).
Please, does any of these names says anything to anybody on the list? I
would be glad to transcribe them to the standard used in the list if I know
where to obtain it.
I would like to know where it is in today's India and where I can leran more
about the places people or times mentioned above.
Since the Chinese translation is from the beginning of the fifth century the
names reffered must be much older.
Thank you very much for kind attention
Cordially
