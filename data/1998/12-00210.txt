Replying to a digest... Some mailer may not show the thread correctly.
Anyways,
I thought
J. A. B. Buitenen, _The Maitraaya.niiya Upani.sad, A Critical Essay,
with Text, Translation, and Commentary_, Hague 1962
was the definite source on the
Maitri/Maitreya/Maitraaya.na/Maitraaya.nii/Maitraaya.niiya Upani.sad :-)
Should be avialable somewhere, I think.
