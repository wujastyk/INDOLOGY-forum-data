You don't mention the titles of the four Hindi poems so I did a larger search,
not, moreover, excluding non-Hindi items.  The following titles appear on a
search of OCLC Firstsearch.  The "Accession Number" is the same as an
OCLC number, which would be needed by your interlibrary loan librarian.
These are available at various libraries around the country.
