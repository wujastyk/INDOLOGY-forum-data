Aids to the study of Shankaracharya
Response to K.S. Arjunwadkhar re: aids to the study of Shankaracharya:
I have included substantial and "reader-friendly" selections (rendered in
English only) from the Brahmasutra commentaries of both Shamkara and
Ramanuja in my SIX CLASSICS OF EASTERN PHILOSOPHY (Harcourt Brace, 1998,
ISBN 0-15-567749-7).  This anthology is intended as an introduction to
eastern philosophical classics for students at the undergraduate level and
for general readers.  It is not aimed at the scholarly community, but you
might find it of some interest.
