freeware devanagari TTF
Namaskar,
There is a nice free devanagari font available from
http://www.geocities.com/~omkara/Sanskrit/Devanagari.zip . The layout is
very similar to the English one. I can send it to you.
There is also a freeware available at
http://www.geocities.com/~omkara/Itrans.htm for converting a large store of
sanskrit documents available in on the Internet into Devanagari/Roman
transcription.
For easy typing with the Devanagari font given above you can download a free
Word template from http://www.elidor.demon.co.uk/sanskrit/index.htm
Greetings,
Vishvarupananda
