and in another posts talks about the fairy tales of Feuerstein.
 Churchill is supposed to have said that he didn't read a book unless
it gave him either pleasure or profit. As has been agreed before
the writings of Messrs Kak and Frawley are as unprofitable as can be
; and give other genuine anti-AMT resarchers like Sethna a bad name.
So, let us look at their entertainment value now.

  Page 47 lists the words in various languages for given words...these
souls tell us that in sanskrit, "two" becomes "dva", which is correct
superficially, not correct if taken in it's most accurate form...it
is normally written as -dvi-( when prefixed, as in "dvija:") and changes
to dva in conjunction with dasha, vimsha and trimsha) and when used
individually, becomes dvau or dve depending on the gender. Yet,
These souls try to hoist off "dvA" as the most common form of two
in Samskrt.

  OF course, lower down, they mention the samskrt word for "8" as
"ashtau"..this is something absurd, since the "-au" ending comes about
only in dvivacanam. (just as it is meaningless to have words like
ekai:, or ekAbhyAm, the word "aSTau" for 8 is also nonsensical.)

   Subhash Kak then claims in regard with his frequency distributions
that the "-sya ending" is most common in shashThI vibhakti words...
(This is how the decipherment of some of the Indus valley seals was
carried out) I am not sure as to how this can be since this ending
exists in pullimga and napumsakalimga akArAnta endings( and probably
in a few other zabdas that I don't know of) but is it so common as he
claims?

    Page 245 makes the claim that the saptarSis married the kr~ttikAs
who are the same as "Plaeides" and were 7 in number,this is certainly
not sure since the krttikAs were 6(Both V.S.Apte and Monier Williams
give the number as 6) and this can also be verified in the
'kumArasambhavam". This correction of 6 to 7 seems to be another
example of "kAkism".

    This therefore raises very serious doubts about the ability of
these gentlemen to translate the samskrt texts that they quote,
and all translations veracity cannot be vouched for.

   Bottom line : The book is a good test for determining the
quality of a potential proof reader. since faultswise the book is
"AdimadhyAntarahitam"( lacks neither a begining, a middle nor and end
)....so faultswise, the book is a good example of "The more the
merrier".

Krishna
