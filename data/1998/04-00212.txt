[Forward] Manuscripts in New York City.
The following message is from the Sanskrit Mailing List ad might be of
interest to members of INDOLOGY.
Readers:
I have made several attempts to have some light thrown on a bunch of palm leaf
manuscripts that I have inherited.  Can someone help me?  Alternatively, can
someone guide me to the right newsgroup?
I have 70 bundles, nearly 30 of them are complete books.  Only one of them has
been identified, it is the Shree Bhashyam of Shree Ramanujacharya.  With the
exception of two which are written in Tamil script, the rest are written in
Telugu script, though the language is Sanskrit.
I live in New York City.  I will gladly show them to anyone who is nearby or
who can come here.
