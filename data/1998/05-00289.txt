There are two rather comprehensive Encyclopaedias on Indian Literature(s)
published in India:
1) Amaresh Datta (Chief Editor): Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature, Vol.
1-6, Sahitya Akademi, New Delhi, 1987-94.
This runs through the alphabet from A to Z (works and authors).

2) GangA RAm Garg: International Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature, First
published in 1982 ff., Revised and Enlarged Edition, Mittal Publications,
Delhi,1987 ff.
This is divided according to the different languages of India. Vol. I (2
Parts) contains Sanskrit, Pali, Prakrit & ApabhraMza. The Dravidian
literatures are covered by Vol. II (Tamil), IV (Kannada), V (Telugu), VI
(Malayalam).

Don't ask me about the scholarly quality of these encyclopaedias! But even
if they in many respects do not reflect the latest state of scholarship,
they are useful in their own way.
