Against Aryan Invasions
The Indology list charter says that the list is for discussions among
practicing indology scholars, and others are welcome to read, but are
definitely discouraged from posting. I read the list mainly to add to my
knowledge of indology, but there is also an important side-effect of
fostering meta-impressions of the state and quality of the field in
general.
With that background, I would like to understand if the recent postings
of Samar Abbas are thought to represent serious professional
"Indological" opinions. I find it astonishing that a serious researcher
(assuming Abbas is one) would take unbaked opinions like those
purportedly of Ved Acharya below and pass them off as a "good summary"
of a position on a controversial research issue. Talk of knocking down
strawmen and shooting fish in a barrel. Both amusing activities, no
doubt, but they are not research.
Also, re Samir Abbas's crude revisionst theories about the linguistic
history of Urdu: I would certainly hope, for the sake of integrity of
the field of indology, that, if a graduate student of indology came up
with such a purported historical chart, his advisor would do the student
the kindness of telling him that "crappy" and "bogus" aren't
inappropriate terms to describe his thesis and his methodology.
Samir Abbas, if you consider yourself a researcher, be kind enough to
provide the name of the institution you work for, so that I can take
appropriate precautions.
