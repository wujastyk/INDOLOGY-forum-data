SV: creation of human kind
Sorry for kicking in the allready wide open door of the theodicee. I'm sure
that no one can be convinced of the nonexistence of God if he or she
doesn't want to. The human mind is cunning enough allways to find a back
door when faced with a logically consistent and valid argument.  So let's
not pursue a pointless discussion. I would however like to defend the
athe?st or nonthe?st position as a valid one against this front of new age
or old age misty mythical and mystical believers who take their own
prejudice for granted. 
My second point is that the remark that 'God's nonexistence cannot be
proved', which started the discussion, should be replaced with the
observation that this list is not the right place for a discussion about
the existence of God. This is because of the duplex ordo, the seperation of
worldly and religious matters. This is a list for scientific discussion and
science belongs to the world of cause and effect, it is the same for a
hindu(tva), muslim or athe?st.
The arguments in favour of God's existence which I have seen would also fail
the minimal criteria for decent philology, hermeneutics, logic or
semiotics.
