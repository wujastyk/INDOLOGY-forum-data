                It is near Rameswaram. It is to the north of
        Ramanathapuram. There is a place called Devipattinam.
        The sea-front in this place is known as Dharbha Sayanam.
        As you would have guessed, it is associated with Rama.
        Just before crossing the sea, Rama is said to have
`       done a penance and as an associated ritual, he is
        said to have lain on a spread of Dharbha grass.
