A transgression? (on Tolstoy and ahimsa)
Op 01-feb-98 schreef Jan E.M. Houben:
 Tolstoy's undertanding of Indian thought in general and of ahimsa
Buddhism.
Could you tell me what your sources are? As far as I know Tolstoy got all his
'compassion' from christianity and his idealism from Rousseau. What buddhist
texts could Tolstoy possibly know?
