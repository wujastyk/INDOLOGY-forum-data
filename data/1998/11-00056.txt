Paired Horse and PIE breakup

Thinking the unthinkable, what if IE languages were already being
spoken in these regions 6,000 BC or even earlier and some other invaders
brought the horse and disappeared? Why not? Haven't IE peoples invaded
each others' lands afterwards? Didn't other invaders disappear from
history with their language?
When does the bronze age begin? Wheels are hard to make without
metal.
