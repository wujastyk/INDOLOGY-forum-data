SV: SV: Is the Aryan Invasion a Myth?
Hello Jacob,
I am sorry that you keep getting these attachments, but you seem to be the only one. At least no one else reports them. However, another contact yesterday received an email which not only contained the attachment that was supposed to be there, but also a large section of a private letter to my daughter. I haven't the faintest idea what goes on, but I just received my Microsoft User Group card, and I'll call them and see if they know more.

Dear Lars:
I keep getting attachments when you reply to a list message.
Here is what I got this time.
