        There is an interesting true episode involving the
        poet Supra Deepa KaviRaayar, which stands witness to this.
        The fact that he honoured Kumara Guruparar and his
        Meenaatshiyamman PiLLaith Thamilz is more due to
        religious fervour than anything else.
        But it looks like there have been Sangams for Tamil
        along the course of history.
        There was VajraNandhi's Sangam. In the SriVaishnava
        Parambara, there is mention of a Tamil Sangam in existence
        during the time of Nammaalzvar. It is possible that
        some of the Pandyan kings would have tried to revive
        the tradition, since some of them call themselves as
        "iRantha Kaalam eduththa".
        Some of them like Paraakram Pandya and Adhiveera Raama Pandya
        surrounded themselves with many poets and scholars.
        Even minor lords like ThirumalaiRayan of Karaikkaal
        had 64 poets who clashed with the Aasukavi KaaLamegam.
        May be what you meant was Thirumalai Raayan and not
        Thirumalai Nayakkan.
        As late as the 18th century, Marudhu Brothers of Sivaganga
        did  have a coterie of scholars in permanent residence
        with them.
