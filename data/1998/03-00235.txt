I disagree. The AIT theory is already repudiated on lack of evidence.
What the saffron crowd attempts to do is repudiate the AMT theory.
Also, these people do not really represent the Indigenous Aryan
crowd among mainstream Indian scholars.  They market more to Indians
in the West and New Agers.
I also have to agree that is wrong to call these people revisionists.
There is no former history of an Aryan invasion of India. Not among
the Indians, Iranians, Greeks, Chinese, Muslims or anyone. Not the slightest
suggestion.  The idea originated among the British of the 19th century,
so they are the ones revising history.
