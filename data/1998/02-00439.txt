The Tamil lokayata text is published. In 1995, edited by
S. Soundarapandian at Govt. Oriental Mss. Library, Madras.
I must say that this edition contains many errors.
Only the mss. at GOML is consulted, and NOT the one
at Perur Adheenam. If both were seen together, the edition
would have been much better. In general, the Govt. editions from
GOML really are not upto high standards.

For a long time, it is known that Kavichakravarti JayamkoNTaar
wrote a vaLamaTal, known as kArAn2ai vizupparaiyan2 maTal.
