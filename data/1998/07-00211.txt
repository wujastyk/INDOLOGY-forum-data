Dear Colleagues,
at first I have to thank all them of You they was prepared to send me
hints (or other helpful material) on my "Gajendramoksha" and
"ALB"-calls.
Today I'm looking for information, if does there exist any
"AvatAra-List" which include even this "Gajendramoksha".
I'm in possession of some notes I made some years ago during a seminar
but I can't find bibliographical specifications.
Thank you, best wishes,
Katja Hofmann
