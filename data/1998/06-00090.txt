Most of this should be in the bibliography of my thesis:

Frederick Mosteller/David L. Wallace 1963, "Inference in an authorship
probem", Journal of the American Statistical Association, 58:274ff.

F. Mosteller and David L. Wallace 1964: Inference and Disputed Authorship.
The Federalist. Reading, Mass., Addison-Wesley Publishing Company.

Tweedie/Singh/Holmes: 1994, Neural Network Applications in Stylometry: The
Federalist Papers. Proceedings of the 3rd Conference on the Cognitive
Science of Natural Language Processing. Dublin, Dublin City University.

Holmes, D. I. 1995. The Federalist Revisited: New Directions in Authorship
Attribution. Literary and Linguistic Computing, p. 111-127.

using Multivariate Statistical Analysis. Literary and Linguistic Computing.

Apart from these titles, I suggest you check out the bibliography of my thesis.
