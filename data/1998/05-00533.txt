The problem I have with such a 'reading' of the seals is this and
limited only to the assumed use of the seals/tablets: The corpus of
seals have not been fully deciphered. We are taking anecdotal evidence
from a few imageries (from out of a very small statistical sample of
about 3000 inscriptions only; note also the over 50 seals with
svastika_) and concluding that the pictorials are vividly
religious(with an underlying assumption that the IVC traditions
continued into later historical periods of the region). How about the
signs which accompany the pictorials? Can they be read in this
'religious' context? What language? Why were the seals used to depict
these religious beliefs? Can we assume that they were used like
'amulets' comparable to the later-day lingayat tradition?
Is it unreasonable to start with a hypothesis that many seals/tablets
were used in trade?
