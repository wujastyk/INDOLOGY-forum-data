   languages and archaeology. David W. Anthony.
Would appreciate additional references to archaeological reports related to
the bronze metallurgy finds in the Sintashta-Petrovka culture and the
rationale for the comparisons with the "aryan rituals described in Rigveda".
Any reference to soma? Do the metallurgical finds compare with artifacts found
in Mesopotamia or IVC? Any seals or inscriptions?
