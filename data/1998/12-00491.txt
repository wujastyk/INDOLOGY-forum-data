creation of human kind
Dear Mr. Bannerjee
This is not true. Creation as the cause of mankind's appearance on earth has
been around a long time. If this has to be debunked I would need a much
worthier opponent than evolution.
I beg to disagree. I was born and brought up a Christian, but I have
questioned my religion many times and have always found the answers.
Believing in creation does not make me a fundamentalist. You would be
surprised at the number of scientists that find the theory of evolution
lacking in scientific evidence. I can give you quotes and books but am
unable to do at this time so since I am enroute to India on vacation. If you
want a list of renowned scientists that believe in creation, I can provide
you with one on my return.
There is no scientific evidence,
