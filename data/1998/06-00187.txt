        The significance of placing the Yagna UpavIta across
        the knees temporarily is a ritual of a different
        nature. It does not however cause any changes in the
        body system. The function of the YOga PaTTa is
        entirely different. It has an esoteric as well as
        exoteric significances. It is neither an adornment,
        nor a just a mere limb/posture supportive sling.
        It has its specific purposes.
        I will get back to you with whatever can be divulged;-)
        later.
