Sankara, Vivekananda &c.
List members,
I see that asparza yoga (mentioned in gauDapAdA kArikA) in absent in zaGkarA's
writings which implies that saGkarA did not follow up on yoga/meditative
aspects, but placed all his emphasis on logic.
As for VivekanandA, one statement that I thought is his original (most other
stuff is spiritual), reads something like "Education is the manifestation of
the knowledge that is already in the mind etc".  This implies that people
already know, but the knowledge is just uncovered by the process of education.
Any one knows this idea is expressed by any thinker before him?
