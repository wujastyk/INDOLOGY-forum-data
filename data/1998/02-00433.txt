        The above-mentioned source contains some yantras which
        are used by the Malays and Thais.
        There are several books in Tamil which deal directly
        with the subject., diagrams, prayoga, deity, etc.
        They are very comprehensive and straight to the point.
        It would need somebody to transcribe or translate. Some
        are from rare sources like the Siddhars.
        If you are interested I can post you the titles.
        I was feeling it would have been more appropriately
        posted into the RISA list, Hindu-net, or IJTS.
        Regards
        Jayabarathi
