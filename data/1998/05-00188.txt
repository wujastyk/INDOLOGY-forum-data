You are quite incorrect.  First of all, I was referring primarily to
anthropological remains. Many of the early steppe people were biologically
similar to modern and ancient Altaic speaking peoples but not to modern or
ancient Iranians.
The fragmentary evidence of Iranian writings in the steppe mean
nothing.  No more than early fragmentary Arabic writings in Indonesia or
China.  There is  evidence of Altaic archaeological culture
in the steppe and also linguistic evidence in local languages.
