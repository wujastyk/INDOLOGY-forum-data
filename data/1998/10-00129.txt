Subject: SV: Question about KiraNa Agama
Message-ID: <161227041821.23782.12011159527107610489.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>


Can anyone point me to studies on the KiraNa Agama? I referred to Jan
Gonda's excellent book "Medieval Religious Literature in Sanskrit" and
the only reference he has given is in french. If anyone is aware of any
studies on this Agama, please let me know. I shall request Lars Martin
Fosse to provide instant moksha to anyone who helps :-). Thanks.


Hello Rama,

I am a bit short on moksha right now, I actually need some myself (moksha from an excessive workload), but I'll keep it mind, and as soon as I have fresh moksha to offer, I'll dole it out freely!
