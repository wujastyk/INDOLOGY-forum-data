I differ with Robert Zydenbos for the following reasons

1. The existence of two words kUDalasangadEva and kappaDi sangadEva
clearly shows that kUDala and KappaDi are adjectives qualifying the
noun sangadEva.

2. The great bilingual virasaiva poet pAlakuriki sOmanAtha who has
written   the epic basavapurANa based on the life of basavEswara
uses the the word sanga as the name of the god. I am quoting from
trlugu version from memory

        OdakumOdaku mOrOri sanga!
        ODakumODAku monDuyu nolla

Hey you sanga! Do not run! Do not run!
Do not run! I want nothing from you!

Unless there was a stromg virasaiva tradition of treating
the word sanga as a noun and a name of the god,
sOmanAtha would not have written like that.
If there is some body on the list who has the
kannaDa version of bbasavapurANa I will be very happy
if they check there.

regards,

sarma.
