Also for what it's worth - Machek [ESJC, pp. 685, 688] would want to see
reflexes of two IE roots here:
*weg'h - "to go (using means of transportation); to convey by cart or sled"
*wegh - "to move (rapidly)" [akin to G. >bewegen<]
He connects the All-Slavic >veslo< - "paddle, oar" - not with *weg'h (as is
commonly accepted, veslo <-- *vez-slo), but with *wegh (veslo <-- *veg-slo,
-slo being a suffix used to create words denoting tools).
The meaning of >veslo< wouldn't then be "instrument of conveying", but
rather "instrument of moving".
