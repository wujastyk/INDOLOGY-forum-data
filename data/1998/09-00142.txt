Best computer for Sanskrit?
I don't want to stir up the pot. But in response to Prof Thillaud's
objection to an earlier commercial ad., would the below stuff constitute
commercial? How do we decide whether something is commercial if the below
is not one? For instance someone wanting to find a publisher for his/ her
work in Indology would have benefitted from that contact in much the same
way as someone wanting to buy Indian fonts would have benefitted from the
below info.
