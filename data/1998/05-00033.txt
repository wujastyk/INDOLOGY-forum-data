Many thanks for the ref. to "The Cult of Jagannath..." I shall look it
up.
Your comments about the "relics" being associated with a sannyasin
burial are interesting and shall be pursued.

 I think, however all types of death related matters are to some degree
polluted, not just the death of a sannyasin. Numerous rites, rituals and
customs keep matters of death and the dead body at a distance, e.g . the
purification associated with fire. the cremation grounds on the edge of
a village, particular segregated indidviduals who work on the cremation
ghats,  etc..

Thanks again,
Mary
