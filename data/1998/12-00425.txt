The primacy to Bhagvadgita is old, probably predating Sankaracharya
himself. Similarly we know the popularity of Sri Krishna and the Ganga
river. Not to say that the primacy was accorded to these after Sri
Sankara wrote the Bhaja Govindam. He was merely expounding the known
facts about society .

I have listened to M. S. Subbulakshmi herself singing
Bhajagovindam few times in person. Rajaji's exposition is
beautiful.

Want to know how far back Gita quotes go before Sankara?

Thanks,
N. Ganesan
