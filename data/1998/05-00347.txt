Horses/Indus seals
On Thu, 7 May 1998, Georg von Simson wrote:
It has been pointed out that the cow is not represented on the seals
either, although the bull is ubiquitous and cow bones have been found in
large quantities. Nor is the camel represented figuratively despite camel
bones also being found.  Likewise with the onager and perhaps other
animals as well. Accordingly, the animals represented on the seals do not
exhaust the zoological diversity of the IVC.  Regards,  Edwin  Bryant.
