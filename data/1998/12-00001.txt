I have also been receiving most (though not all!) your postings with
attachments.  But the best part is that Jacob's posting telling you about
the attachments came with an attachment!  Are you there jacob!

only one. At least no one else reports them. However, another contact
yesterday received an email which not only contained the attachment that was
supposed to be there, but also a large section of a private letter to my
daughter. I haven't the faintest idea what goes on, but I just received my
Microsoft User Group card, and I'll call them and see if they know more.
