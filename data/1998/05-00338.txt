I fail to see the point you are making here. Of course I appreciate
 your eye for the details. But unless you want to claim
"saMgamEswara" , "saMgama" and " SaMga" are different dieties
(and any such claim cannot be maintained ) I fail to see what
difference it makes
I did some looking up in the library here. Though the historical
accuracy of sOmanAtha is irrelevant here, because we are dealing
with the meaning of a word, we can leave him alone for the present.
cennabasava is the nephew of basavEswara and more or less his
successor He has a large body of vacanAs to his credit. His ankita is
"kUDalacennasaMgamadEvA". The word "cenna" is right in the middle of
"kuDAla" and "saMgana". This shows that he does not consider
"kUDalasaMgama" as a tautological compound. Therefore we should not
do that. Futher in his vacanAs he addresses the deity as "saMgA!" in
many places.  This shows sOmanAtha afterall is following the
prevalent tradition. This I hope settles the issue and proves for all
the people concerned that the deity's name is "saMgamadEva"
and "kUDala' is a qualifier and also "saMga" , "saMgama",
samGamadEva' are all one.
Thanking you,
