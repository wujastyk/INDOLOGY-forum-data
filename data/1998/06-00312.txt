Tampering with history

My reading of Palaniappan's (as usual) excellent latest posting is that
"large enough" is so poorly defined as to become almost meaningless.
His example gives a group of 0.15 to 0.7 percent of the total population
(his sample, and note, not historical, figures) having a real cultural
and linguistic impact, to the point, if I understand him correctly,
of making Malayalam a language distinct of Tamil. So how large is "large
enough" for you? What do you have in mind as a figure for the number of
Aryans entering India?
You must have a decidedly personal view of what happened in Latin
America. Using one of the numerous European colonial enterprises as
an analogy for how Aryans entered India brings us back to the image
of the conquering Aryan riding in and enslaving the indigenous popu-
lation. And I thought that stuff was history.
