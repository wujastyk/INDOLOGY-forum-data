Since you mention a (forthcoming?) book by E.G. Kahrs,
I figure it is not out of place to mention an article by E.G.Kahrs
due to appear this june in the journal "Histoire, Epist?mologie, Langage"
(together with contributions by M. Deshpande, J. Bronkhorst,
P.-S. Filliozat, F. Zimmermann, & J.-L. Chevillard;)
[HEL, Tome XX, Fascicule 1, 1997; ISSN 0750-8069 ]
Kahrs's paper title is:
L'interpr?tation et la tradition indienne du Nirukta
This was his contribution to a "colloque"
organized in Paris in january 1995:
"Grammaires Indiennes: Th?orie et Histoire"
