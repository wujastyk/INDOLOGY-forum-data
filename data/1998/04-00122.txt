[Announcement] Samaveda available. (fwd)
Samaveda available.
Hello all,
I just wanted to let you know that the Kauthuma Samhita of the Samaveda is
available in CSX and Postscript formats from:
        http://weber.u.washington.edu/~apandey/texts
The actual source text is encoded in CS/CSX, however the document has TeX
control sequences which enable it to be typeset using ITRANS and LaTeX.
The Postscript document is a completely formatted version of the source
file.
[...]
Regards,
Anshuman Pandey
I have added a link to this site from the INDOLOGY web pages (Virtual
Archive of e-Texts).
