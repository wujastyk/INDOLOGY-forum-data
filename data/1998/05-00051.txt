human sacrifice
Pl. see:
K. Lahiri, Human sacrifice by Tantriks and its Suppression,
Calcutta review, 137, 2, p. 173-178, 1955

Aside:
May be D. Shulman's book on human sacrifice in Indic literature,
art, & a comparison to the West does not have the above reference.
David will be happy on this reference, as I have given him rare
titles of tamil stalapuraaNam, pirapantam, etc., almost for a
decade now.
If people leave me alone, I can do good things.
eg: Chola Pallippatai temples & who built them
for umaadevi.
