Dear members of the list,

I am searching for the distributer of the TTF 'Indo Times Roman'. Can
anybody provide me with information ?
The second question I have is about (freely distributed) fonts (or fonts in
generall) and copyrights. If I change some characters of a font, like adding
characters to it, am I free to handle it as it were my own font ? Is it
possible to distribute this font for an e-journal ?

Thank you in advance,
Arash
