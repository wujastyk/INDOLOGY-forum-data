Some of these attributes are rather general in Vajrayana and Kalacakra
Buddhism.  For example, the Kalacakra supreme deity wears a tiger skin,
has the third eye, has yab-yum and mani-padma characteristics, is the
destroyer of the universe, is time incarnate, has multiple heads
(usually four or five), and multiple arms (usually 12 or 24), and has
his hair in a high topknot.
