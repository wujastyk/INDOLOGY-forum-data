This does not explain the occurance of name saGgamezwara without
the addition of kUDala. A more rational hypothesis will be to
assume that ordinary people who did not understand that sangama =
kUDala started calling saGgamEZwara as kUDala saGgamEzwara. In Andhra
people are named as saGgamEzwara. For example the great vaiNika
TumurADa SaGgamEzwara sAstri. Thus the gods name as saGgamEZwara
is prevelent in Andhra.
