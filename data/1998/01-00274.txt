Shalom to all,

In response to my previous message, E. Harzer Clear suggested that I
consult M. Mayrhofer?s etimology dictionary, for the meaning of the name
"Naciketas". Since Mayrhofer does not deal with the name, nighter with
the term "naci", I address you again:

Charpentier (Indian Antiqary,  vol. 57, 1928, p. 205 note 38) rejects
the traditional interpretation "na+ciketas", endorsed by Bohtlingk, as
"without any value". He reads the name as "naci+ketas",  following Prof.
Wackernagel?s observation that "naci is the form of nakra, to be used as
the first part of a compound".  Thus he finds it parallel to Kamadeva's
epithet - "Makaraketu", and hence similar to the name "Svetaketu" of the
Chandogya Upanisad.
I shall be very grateful for any comments, information and sources,
concerning the name Naciketas, and specially for answers on two
questions:
1. What does the term "naci" mean, and how does it relate to nakra or
   nakraa?
2. How is Naciketas related to Kama, when he rejected cmpletely all
   the pleasures of love, according to the story in Kathopanishad?
