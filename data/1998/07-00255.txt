Q: The Hibbert Journal
Dear Members
I would like to know about religious background of _The Hibbert Journal --
A Quarterly Review of Religion, Theology, and Philosophy_ (Oct. 1902 - Jan.
1963). London-Oxford: Williams and Norgate.  Did any special religious
group found this journal?  The editor of the early stage was L.F. Jacks.
What kind of sect or school did he belong to?
If anybody gives some instruction, I am very grateful.
