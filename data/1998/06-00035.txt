What is the value of the average of two guesses of which at least one can be
quite easily disproved? Rather search for more satisfactory methods than for
quick and soothing results. See end of my first *truth and method* posting for
some hints on the methodological state of the art of the main disciplines
involved in the issue. And see my posting *Indo-Aryan im-/e-migration
discussion and beyond* for a suggestion how to proceed in a methodologically
sound way.
