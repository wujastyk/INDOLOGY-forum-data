That is true. But you have to explain why fair skin is preferable. The most
reasonable explanation, in my opinion, is that fair skin was once connected
with high social status.

This observation is, of course, quite true! India is a place where lots of
people have met and mixed. It was a good place to live, and a place people
would rather come to than leave. That there is a mixing of races in India is
also obvious. Even the Indo-Europeans mixed with the locals, in spite of
their conservative marriage habits. But I don't think the IE gang ignores
the fact that Indians in the eastern states have mongoloid features!
