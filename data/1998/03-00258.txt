Dear Robert,
Do you really mean what you wrote about Vivek?nanda ? I fully respect
your opinion, of course, but presenting him as a racist third-rate
thinker does seem a bit, shall I say, unscholarly. Wether or not one
agrees with him, it is hard to deny the quality and the importance of
Vivek?nanda's writings.
