A question on Tamil dialects
My father and grandfather (and so on) are from man2n2ArkuTi area. I
have not heard them use "vassAn2". As pointed out by Smt. Vasu
Renganathan, "tiTTu" is more common, though I have heard some of my
relatives use "vasAn2" (like in "kuzandhaiyai vesAn2AmA?")
occasionally.
