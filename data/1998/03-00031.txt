TrueType fonts, TeX etc.

Post-1990 TeX has what is without doubt the best approach to the use of
special character sets available in any major system: virtual fonts. A
virtual font is a layer of software that "tames" a raw font and makes it
act as the user wishes. In use it "feels" just like a real font. Among the
advantages of this approach are that one can make virtual fonts
implementing special character sets for any real font one chooses: there
are no copyright hassles. There is a big collection of virtual fonts
implementing CSX for a wide range of underlying real fonts -- both
Computer Modern and PostScript -- available at the website given below:
follow the "fonts" link, then "csx-fonts" and finally "TeX".
EmTeX will certainly be capable of handling such fonts, but as I don't
have it on my machine I cannot tell you how to set it up. Usually all that
is necessary is (1) to put the TFM files in the usual directory for such
things, (2) to put the VF (virtual font) files in a specific directory,
and (3) to set an environment variable to point to that directory. If you
need further help, it would probably be sensible to post a query to
comp.text.tex. I think this group is not an appropriate place to take this
topic further.
