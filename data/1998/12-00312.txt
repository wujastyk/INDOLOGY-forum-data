It might very well be that you are right. The reason for my entering this
discussion was that I remembered Lokesh Chandra's theory and just wondered
whether in the meantime anybody had refuted it (I have not read all the
literature Jonathan Silk was kind enough to draw our attention to, because
MahAyAna Buddhism is not my field of study). The evidence for
avalokitasvara seems to be weak indeed, and if there were not the Chinese
translation "Kuan Yin", which seems to confirm it, one could perhaps follow
M. Deshpande's suggestion (see 15 Dec.) and try to eliminate the problem by
finding a Prakrit explanation. In one of the manuscripts from Central Asia
(to be dated around 500 AD), a protection magic (vidyA) written in a hybrid
language and unregulated orthography (published in Sanskrithandschriften
aus den Turfanfunden, Ed. by E. Waldschmidt, Vol. 3, Wiesbaden, 1971, Ms.
no. 844) we find the formula:
   namo buddhAya dharmAya sa(M)ghAya arya-(a)palokidasvaraya (sic!  some
lines later we read: aryavalok(i)t(...) bodhisatvaya)  mahasatvaya
sarvvakarmasadhakaya abhayadataya! ("Obeisance to the Buddha, the dharma,
the sangha, to the noble Apalokidasvara, (the bodhisatva), the great being
who accomplishes all works (finishes all karma?) and grants safety").
Allow me to withdraw from the discussion with this pious little contribution!
