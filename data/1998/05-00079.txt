Koel (and Hobson-Jobson)
You're right!
There is a very useful glossary,
Hobson-Jobson (Henry Yule & A.C. Burnell)
which does not seem to rest on everybody's shelf
(as it should :-)
On page 490 (Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers, 1994 edition)
it gives a 1526 quotation that reads as:
c.1526. -- ``Another is the *Koel*, which in
length may be equal to the crow, but is
much thinner. It has a kind of song, and
is the nightingale of Hindustan. It is
respected by the natives of Hindustan as
much as the nightingale is by us. It
inhabits gardens where the trees are close
planted.'' -- _Baber_, p.323
Best regards
