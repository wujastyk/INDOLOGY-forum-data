archeologists, but a very difficult one. From my point of view, I reject
completely Renfrew's theory but Mallory (In Search of the Indo-Europeans
...) seem to make very fine and credible synthesis. He is considering the
culture Andronovo (south of Oural mountains) as a good candidate for
Indo-Aryan homeland but, clearly, the task is unfinished: Andronovo's
people is a recent one (2nd mill.), too recent to be an Indo-Greek
homeland. I would prefer the Yamnaya civilisation (4th-3rd mill.) lying
along the North of the Caspian and Black Seas.

        Hoping to help,

PS: searching an indirect phonetical link between [Uttara] Kuru and
[Hyper]boreans (Gr. huper = Skr. upara) is very dubious but not strictly
impossible: the mythical Ossetic family name Boratae and some other names
give perhaps a track, but almost completely erased ...
