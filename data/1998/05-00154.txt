Horses
Well, Dominique. On a spring day, Siva and Parvati
could not overcome passion. They transform themselves
to elephants. Ganesha is born as a result, so says
Sambandhar (fl. 642 AD).
This origin myth of Ganesa is different from the majority
of tamil/sanskrit stories on Ganesa's birth. You must
hear this tEvaaram sung by an Otuvaar in a "siva
temple to realize the power.
       piTi atan2 uru umai koLa miku kari atu
       vaTikoTu tan2atu aTi vazipaTumavar iTar
       kaTi kaNapati vara aruLin2an2 miku koTai

gajAnana sevaka,
N. Ganesan
