Did people in antiquity see pets in the same rather romantic way that
modern society does? Was there a Puranic Rin Tin Tin ?

There was the story (Pancatantra?) of the mongoose who saves his master's
baby from a cobra but the master comes home and seeing his mouth bloody
concludes he's killed the baby and kills him, but then discovers his error.

The ancient pets were I think mongooses, birds of various sorts (parrots,
mynas, geese), and deer.
