Urdu speakers
Dear Members of the List,
I am reluctant to get into this debate, however it needs to be pointed out
that most scholars, including most (but not all) South Asian scholars of
Urdu have accepted an Indo-Aryan pedigree for all of the following:
(1) Zabaan-e-Dehlavi (the precursor of Zabaan-e-Urdu), spoken in Delhi
under the Delhi Sultanate (1211 to 1504), carried to the Deccan and spoken
there as Dakhini, and surviving today as Kaarkhandaari Urdu;
(2) Zabaan-e-Urdu-e-Mu'alla (its successor), developing in Delhi after the
shifting of the Mughal Court there in 1648, and differing from
Zabaan-e-Dehlavi in having more influence from the dialect of Agra, where
the court was formerly;
(3) Modern Urdu as standardized by the poets, written first in Delhi and
later also in Lucknow, and first mentioned as "Urdu" in a couplet written
by the poet Mushhafi (1750-1824), dated to ca. 1776.
Khari Boli is the speech on which the Zabaan-e-Dehlavi is based, and after
the shifting of the Mughal Court to Delhi it survived as a sort of country
cousin of Zabaan-e-Dehlavi. Standard Urdu has abandoned many Khari Boli
forms.
The identification of Urdu as Indo-Aryan is based on analysis of its
grammar (verbs, nouns, pronouns, postpositions) and its core vocabulary, as
contained in texts. Modern Urdu is indeed quite Persianized (and
Arabicized), but this was a gradual process. The poems of Amir Khusrau
(1236-1324), which are usually considered the first Urdu texts, are not
heavily Persianized. The poets of the Delhi School of Urdu poetry  (Mir,
Sauda etc.) wrote a somewhat less Persianized Urdu than those of the later
Lucknow School.
The elite of the Delhi Sultanate and the Mughal Empire spoke Persian, and
considered Zabaan-e-Urdu an Indian (Hindi, Hindavi) language. Hindi and
Hindavi are Persian words.
Standard Hindi based on Khari Boli is a modern language which has been
around for some two centuries. Before being Sanskritized it was almost
identical to Urdu, but without the Perso-Arabic vocabulary. Before the
evolution of Standard Hindi, the literary languages for north Indian Hindus
were Braj Bhasha, Avadhi and Rajasthani.
With best wishes,
