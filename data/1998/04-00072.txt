This reminds me of a description of battle wagons in actual use. Please take
a look at Xenofon's description of the Great King's army on the march (
Anabasis, Book I,7). Here wagons with sharp knives at the end of the axes
and under the wagon are used in front of the army, evidently a practical
weapon, but a weapon that was dependent upon flat ground. Caesar gives a
description of Celtic chariot warriors in his book on Britain. They way they
behave suggest the kind of man to man fighting that is often described in
the Mbh. War was both a ritual and a sport, and chariots probably
disappeared for various reasons, lack of tactical efficiency being one of them.
