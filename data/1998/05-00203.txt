Modern Central Asians come in all types.  Most indigenous Central
Asians (non-Russians) like the Kazakhs, Kirghiz, Uzbeks, Uighurs and
so are Altaic peoples.

The idea that started this thread is that the IE stock was somehow
connected with a horse culture.  Thus, horses = IE migration.

It's not me.  Just read any of numerous authors on the subject.  Were
the original IE speakers similar to Mongols?

Fully aware of this evidence and it is fragmentary. There is nothing
to suggest the local people spoke Tocharian.

You tended to repeat this statement, although I don't know what you
mean.

There may not be an Indo-European family.

Just are simply modifying old "Aryan" racial theories.  Indo-European
is all this and that, but we don't know about the rest.

What about all these new theories connecting Altaic and Uralic, but
under the great white Nostratic/Proto-World banner?
