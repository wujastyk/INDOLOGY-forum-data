An excellent example of (alleged) human sacrifice in modern times in India
is to be found in the initiation rites of the Khalsa where the tenth Guru
of the Sikhs, Guru Govind Rai, founder of the Khalsa panth (sect or
order), is supposed to have sacrificed the Five Beloved*  who  were
miraculously brought back to life by Guru's grace. * Of course some
writers of the time say it were not five humans, but five goats, that
were sacrificed.
