Avadhi Ramayan
        This is correct. And incidentally, TulasI's RAma-carita-mAnasa has
indeed been compared to the Bible, on numerous occasions, by various
authors. Baburam Saxena says that Baisvari, or KosalI, are other names
that have been used for the dialect of Avadhi which was spoken around
Lucknow and adjacent areas. For more on TulasI's RAmAyaNa, see Phil
Lutgendorf's _Life of a Text_.
