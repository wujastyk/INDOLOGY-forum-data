Yes, FW Ellis is indeed a fascinating figure, and if there is actually
surviving unpublished material on or about him, it would be very
worthwhile to follow it up.  I came across him some years back when I was
writing a piece on the smallpox vaccination debates that were very topical
in South India at the beginning of the nineteenth century.  I would be
extremely interested in any writings by Ellis on vaccination.  I strongly
suspect that he wrote pro-vaccination tracts, perhaps in Tamil and/or
Sanskrit, but they have never been found.
All the best,
