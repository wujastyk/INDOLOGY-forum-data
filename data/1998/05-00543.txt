That is exactly the time, medieval period, for hyperstandard forms to arise.
The old change of s>*h>y (in other positions) >0 (initially) was known to
writers through loanwords like a:yiram, e:Ni, avai,etc. An underlying y
forms were written with s. There are many examples from Tamil also to show
that R > r led later to some r's being represented as R. Hypercorrect forms
are generally less systematic and give the impression of a reversal of sound
change.

mataca:nai is clearly a hyperstandard writing. If it was a sound change it
should continue into later times.

The above with -c- are hypercorrect forms. If y became c why not vasal and
vasil.

What you say proves my point.

No. -c- is older as I said earlier. Konda and other SCD languages preserve
the s form, Konda vasking(velar nasal)'entrails'. You seem to think that the
oldest forms are only foound in Tamil in every respect. What is your basis
for taking -y- in vayiRu as older? what am I doing again; take a lsesson on
comparative Drav phonology? Who cares? Linguistics is not a layman's hobby.
