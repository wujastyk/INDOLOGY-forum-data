Although George Thompson has already made the point, and again I am
speaking to an issue for which I have very little expertise,
it seems to me that the almost random and non-systematic (not part of a
series of similar phonemes) development of retroflexion in a few examples
within a family could probably be found to have happened with almost any
sound shift.  To take this as a serious objection to the probability of
the effects of contact would seem so unreasonable as to disallow any such
argument in any language family.  Indeed, if one used a parallel argument
(similar sound and meaning occurring in unrelated languages) against the
occurrence of cognates without origin in genetic or
historic contact, where would historical linguistics be?
