While it is possible for some dead Dravidian language to have had a form
damiLa, but the forms with intrusive "r" are clearly Indo-Aryan. See Kuiper's
"Aryans in the Rigveda", p. 70-79 for a discussion of the insertion of "r"
when words are borrowed into Indo-Aryan. eg. tamiz > dramiDa,  kamuku >
kramu(ka),  pavazam, pavaLam > pravAla, pravADa (p. 70-71).
