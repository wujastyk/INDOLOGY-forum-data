tanuu' and Shankara
Are there any Shankara specialists out there who know if tanuu' is a
regular part of Shankara's vocabulary-- or, if only periodic, what
commentaries has it more than others?  What about glossings of it-- e.g.,
with what word?
On a related point-- is there a concordance a la the VPK-- for his many
works?
