I work actually on Jain-cUrNis, TIkAs, VivaraNas.
That is the commentators like JinadAsa and
Haribhadra comment upon AryA-memoric-stanzas
thereby using a fixed scientific system for
interpretation: they apply so-called anuyogadvAras
for the interpretation of each term provided in
the stanza. The system for applying anuyogadvAras
is transmitted in the so-called
AnuyogadvAra-sUtra. The basis for all these seems
to be borrowed partly from the NyAya-system
(possibly!!qde)
