Greenberg broke apart many of the old genetic language classifications
that existed before while sparing sacred Indo-European.
However, recently he is realizing that these languages are indeed
genetically related under the banner of Caucasoids marching out of
somewhere in Anatolia (Mt. Ararat?).  Thus, Uralic and Altaic, which
were formerly not related according to him, are now in fact related
again! All of this relates to the idea of Caucasoid volksmarch from the
Near East reaching even to the Western hemisphere (Kennewick Man).
