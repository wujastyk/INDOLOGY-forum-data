You say that 7.95.2 is old and then proced to connect its supposed

why connect him all the way to Iran?.
You also tend to presume that the Iranian ideas were probably contemporary
to Rgvedic times!!. This need not be, we just dont know.
The Iranian ideas could be from a later date.
Also, what you have suggested is only a *possibility* as you say and does
not conclusively prove that the 'mountain to the sea'Sarasvati  is
deifferent from the Indian Sarasvati river. Infact it neither proves
nor disproves anything.
Exactly, there is continuity of cultural traits in the SIVC from before and
after the "supposed migration of Aryans". Also:
1. We dont know what the actual religion of SIVC people was.
2. We dont really know much about the culture of the Aryans either.
   There is zilch archeological/textual evidence of migration
   from central asia into India.
3. The little that we do know about religion is just what
   we have from the Rgveda
4. We also know that there is a cultural continuity in the SIVC.
So how can one postulate a migration ???
The only evidence that is claimed to show a migration into India
is the so called "Linguistic evidence".
There is evidence of wide usage (not just minimal)
of copper in "Pre-Harappan times" as well.
This is what R.C.Agrawala has to say "...most scholars suggest that copper
was scarcely made us during the pre-Harappan period at Kalibangan. But
this is far from true. The excavators have told us that the pre-Harappan
levels of Kalibangan have yielded a rich variety of 56 copper objects
which included...."
