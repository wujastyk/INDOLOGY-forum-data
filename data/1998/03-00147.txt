"....I would like to make the following additions:

1. There is an antibiotic called Gangamycin ( not sure of how it got
it's name though..one story that I heard is it was named after the river
Ganga, another version says that it was named after the discoverer,
whose name was Gangadharan.)---"

Gangamycin is named after its discoverer Sree Gangadharam, Pattisapu
who is currently employed as a Professor of Biochemistry at the
Rush Medical School in Chicago, Illinois, USA.

I'll try to forward this message to him!
