        Not only by Iranian. In the languages of the Volga and Permian Finns
(Mordovian, Mari/Cheremis, Udmurt/Votyak and Komi) there are many loanwords
from Indo-Iranian and Proto-Indo-Aryan languages. They coincide with evident
loans in the fields of mythology and ritual. This contacts can be dated by
3rd - 2nd mill. B.C. In Indo-Aryan there are, on the other hand, some
borrowings from Proto-Uralic (dated by the Neolithic period). I could
give examples but I am sure that no reasonable arguments, no proven facts
can make the protagonists of the "India as homeland of all mankind" theory
change their opinion and betray their holy cause.
