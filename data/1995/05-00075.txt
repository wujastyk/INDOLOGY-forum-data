In the spirit of Dominik's  statement yesterday, the following

is made of:



A NEW VERSION OF BUEHLER'S "GRUNDRISS":


                  INDIAN PHILOLOGY AND SOUTH ASIAN STUDIES

The German publisher de Gruyter (Berlin/New York) is ready to release the
first volume of a new, greatly enlarged and much more comprehensive
version of Buehler's famous Grundriss published around the turn of the
century (Grundriss der Indo-Arischen Philologie und Alterthumskunde/
Encyclopedia of Indo-Aryan Research).

The new series, to be announced in more detail later on, is edited by
Albrecht Wezler (Hamburg University) and Michael Witzel (Harvard
University).

The first volume is an update on the interface of archaeology,
linguistics, philology and history of early South Asia (ed. G. Erdosy,
Toronto conference of 1992). 

Other volumes in line include: Epic grammar by Th. Oberlies,  A Handbook 
of Pali Literature by O. von Hinueber (with an appendix by H.O. Pint on 
Grammatical Literature),  and a Vedic history.


The first volume has the following contents:


                   THE INDO-ARYANS OF ANCIENT SOUTH ASIA

                   LANGUAGE, MATERIAL CULTURE AND ETHNICITY
