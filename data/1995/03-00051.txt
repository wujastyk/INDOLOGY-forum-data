Tribal Bronzes which started in 1989 by the german indologist 
Cornelia Mallebrein and which I hope will find your interest.

Madhya Pradesh (including Bastar) and Orissa with special emphasis on the
Kondh tribe. The initial research of three years including extensive field
work resulted in 1993/94 in an exhibition 'The Other Gods - Folk- and Tribal
Bronzes from India' at the Rautenstrauch-Joest-Museum for Ethnology in
Cologne, Germany, which lasted for more than ten months. It coincided with
the publication of a catalogue summarizing the results of the project and
explaining the exhibits. It also contains contributions by 14 reputed
Indologists . Professor G.D. Sontheimer of the South Asia Institute of Heidelberg
University was the academic adviser to the project until his premature death
in 1992.
   The exhibition has now been taken to the State Museum of Ethnology at the
Japanese Palais in  Dresden, the cultural centre of East Germany (until 31.
