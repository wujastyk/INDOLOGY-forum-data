Pointers to Katapayadi formula needed
On the Katapayadi system, including its use to express pi (referred to by 
another respondent), see J.F. Fleet's article "The Katapayadi System of 
Expressing Numbers" in JRAS 1911, pp.788-794.  
The system is also used to express chronograms in some South Indian 
inscriptions: for examples, see Epigraphia Indica 3, p.38, ll.40-41; 4, 
pp.203-4; 34, pp.205-6.
