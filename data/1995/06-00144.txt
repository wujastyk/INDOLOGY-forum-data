Subject: Pointers to Katapayadi formula needed
Message-ID: <161227019833.23782.15245631692959480770.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

On the Katapayadi system, including its use to express pi (referred to by 
another respondent), see J.F. Fleet's article "The Katapayadi System of 
Expressing Numbers" in JRAS 1911, pp.788-794.  

The system is also used to express chronograms in some South Indian 
inscriptions: for examples, see Epigraphia Indica 3, p.38, ll.40-41; 4, 
pp.203-4; 34, pp.205-6.
