once more about CSX
This is in response to Dominik's request:  I have used all possible ascii 
characters in my Manjushree-CSX font to supplement the CSX coding.  For 
example, I have used the upper ascii codes 
1,2,3,4,5,7,14,15,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28, and 29.  I have used these 
codes to represent characters like vowels with length, accent, and 
nasality.  Normally such combinations are not needed by most 
Sanskritists, but they are needed to do hard-core Paninian material.  
These codes can be used on Mac.  I do not know if they can be used on 
Windows.  One could use these codes to accomodate some other language at 
least partially.

RE: Re[4]: "kaumudii"
I haven't noticed a reply to the request for books about plants in Sanskrit
literature.  Forgive me if I am duplicating information that has already been
sent.
The Maadhavanidaana and its chief commentary, Chapters 1--10.
by G.J.Meulenbeld. Leiden 1974.
Appendix 4 is an index of Sanskrit names which gives the Latin names assigned
to them by various botanists.
A supplement to the same index appears as an appendix to 
Das Wissen von der Lebensspanne der Baeume--Suurapaalas V.rk.saayurveda.
ed. Rahul Peter Das.  Stuttgart 1988.
