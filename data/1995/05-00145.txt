Namaste,

Could anyone be kind enough to post the origins ( time frame ) of the Hindi
language?

Just recently a friend of mine told me that spoken Hindi has been in
existance for only a 100 odd years or so, while I dont agree I have no
resources at my disposal to prove this otherwise.

Your input into this matter will be greatly appreciated.

Thank You

Sincerely

Pramit Bhasin
