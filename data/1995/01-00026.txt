JIABS
As of January 1, Lew Lancaster has passed his treasurer's bowl on to me. I
am now the acting treasurer, awaiting ratification by the voting members of
the IABS.
Anyone who wishes to contact the IABS regarding membership, problems with
receipt of the journal, etc. should feel free to e-mail me personally at
the address below. I have also included a postal address and a fax number.
I am just getting the membership list sorted out now on my own computer,
but I will respond as soon as I am able.
Regards,
Joe Bransford Wilson, Jr.
Associate Professor of Philosophy and Religion
Acting Treasurer, International Association of Buddhist Studies
Editor, Dharma Vajra Series on Himalayan Buddhist Studies
