I agree with all three points:
(1) I use "brahmin" as the English form, perhaps also due to my South Indian
bias;
(2) I have never come across a derogatory usage of this form (but I would
welcome evidence on this);
(3) I *force* my first-year students to use this spelling in order to make
them consciously distinguish between the person and the ultimate "Brahman".
(When they leave my care, they are welcome to make their own decisions ...)
Should I rethink, I wonder?
