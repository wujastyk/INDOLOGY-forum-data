Maybe I can help:

There is no e-mail address I know about, but maybe SB does.
BTW: Prof. Kulke has contributed an article to a very important catalogue:
"Die Anderen Goetter - Volks- und Stammesbronzen aus Indien" (The Other 
Gods - folk- and tribal bronzes from India; published 1993), entitled 
"Regionen und Regionalkulturen in der indischen Geschichte". As this
catalogue of the german author Cornelia Mallebrein is of great importance
in the fields of ethnology, oriental history of art, indology and comparative
religious studies, I'll post a short description of this outstanding work
for the list in a couple of days. 
best wishes,
