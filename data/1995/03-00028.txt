teaching of Sanskrit
Indology subscribers,
        I was referred to this list by someone responding to the following
question which I posted on the CLASSICS list from U. of Washington:
        Currently I am a fourth-year graduate student studying Sanskrit. I am
considering possibly writing a dissertation including both Greek and Sanskrit
or Latin and Sanskrit. Some of those with whom I have spoken about this suggest
to me that there are few positions available in general for Sanskrit, and that
attempting to market a dissertation combining *two* languages is just about
impossible.
        Would anyone here be willing to shed light on this? Where is Sanskrit
taught? Is it really a dry well out there as I have been told? Any insights
would be greatly appreciated.
        My apologies if this is the wrong forum for this question. I am doing
this at someone else's suggestion.
