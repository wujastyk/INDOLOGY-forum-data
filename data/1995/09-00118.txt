introduction of printing in India/scribal habits
Printing in India is closely connected with the Jesuits and more
information on the subject, especially on Henriquez can be found in : S.
Rajamanickam S.J., *The first Oriental scholar*, Tirunelveli 1972. The
book deals mostly with Roberto de'Nobili. It sometimes verges on
hagiography but anyway it contains useful chapters on Henriquez and the
beginning of printing in India. 
			I Hope this is useful.
