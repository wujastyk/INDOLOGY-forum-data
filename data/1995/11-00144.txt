St. Petersburg Lexicon in English
In response to a patron's inquiry about the fact that Motilal Banarsidass 
had dropped from its catalog after some years an ad for an English 
version of Boehtlingk and Roth's Sanskrit-Woerterbuch, and a reference to 
the project on this listserve, I asked LC's Delhi 
office to find out from Motilal if they had abandoned the project.  
Motilal replies that they have in fact abandoned it.
