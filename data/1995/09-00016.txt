I don't know how it is among
"Sarjuparia" Brahmins (which
part of India are they from?),
but Tamil Brahmin males are
taught to introduce themselves
formally in Sanskrit by reciting
the "AbhivAdayEt," which
supposedly traces your lineage
and affiliations.
If the "Sarjuparia" brahmins 
do the same, it may help
you compile your list.   The
"AbivAdayEt" doesn't seem to
contain all the variables in
your list, though...  E.g., my
Sanskrit intro goes,
   abivAdayEt
   bhArgava
   vItagavya
   sAvEtasa
   traya rishE:
   pravarAnvita
   vAthUla gotra:                 <-----   gotra
   Apastambha sUtra:
   yajus shAkhAdhyAyI             <-----   follower of which Veda
   srI srInivAsa sharmA nAmAham   <-----   name
   asmi bho:
Incidentally, can some erudite
Indologist translate the word
"pravarAnvita" above?  Also,
what is "Apastambha sUtra:"?
Thanks in advance,
Narayan Sriranga Raja  (alias srinivasa sharman  :-)  )
