You do not say if you want it for WP (WordPerfect?) for DOS or for
Windows. There are several good Sanskrit TTF fonts for Windows, but I
know of nothing satisfactory for WordPerfect for DOS.
One of the good TTF format fonts is available easily by FTP on
ftp.bcc.ac.uk
directory
/pub/users/ucgadkw/indology
The files name is
wnri-PSandTT.zip
All the best
