royal house of kaTattanAT, not tampurAn. `tampurAn' merely means
(something like) `Lord.' Male members of all royal families are
addressed as tampurAn.
Kunjunni Raja (in his `The Contribution of Kerala to Sanskrit
Literature,' pub. by the University of Madras) gives 1774-1838 as
Appu Tampuran's time period.  The date of composition of
Sadratnamaala is given as 1824.
