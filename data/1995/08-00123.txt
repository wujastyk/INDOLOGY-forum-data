Critique of India
Prof. Aklujkar writes:
This is certainly correct. But even if we do not project backwards the
political unity that obtains today, we are still faced with areas that were
large enough and richt enough to fend for themselves - or should have been
so. E.g.: the Mauryas and the Guptas. If I remember correctly, the famous
Prthiviraja also once managed to repel an invasion with a coalition of
North-Indian rajas. I think he failed the second time.
These are certainly important points. But it seems that India - or parts of
the country - were always occupied by foreigners in periods when the
various Northern kingdoms that could have stood as a bulwark against
intruders were seriously weakened. That was certainly the case when the
Brits took over. It would therefore seem that internal political and social
processes were just as important as changes *outside* India. The Mogul
empire could never have been brought down in the times of Akbar and his
nearest successors. In the 18th century it fell like a ripe fruit into the
hands of a bunch of merchants after serious wars between Moguls and
Marathas. The lesson would seem to be that the fragmentary processes of the
subcontinent carry a great deal of the responsibility for the misery of
India.
