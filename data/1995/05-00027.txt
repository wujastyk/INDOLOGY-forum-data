Worldreligions compared (;-)
I thought the original post was not very funny and I imagined it would 
offend some. It obviously did.  The reaction to the fact that it offended 
some seems oddly defensive and not unpuerile.  If Indology has no place 
for the ravings of the Hindutva crowd, perhaps it is also not an ideal 
venue for other marginalia--what someone here in Seattle calls "humor for 
the taste-impaired."
