I hesitate to intrude: I'm not an Indologist, but a lowly philosopher who has only visited India 
once (though we do have Indian research fellows here at Liverpool, courtesy of the Charles 
Wallace Memorial Trust).

But I'm not convinced that we need any special reason why `India' is poor, or relatively 
powerless. I'm not even convinced that India is much more of a unity than that other 
protuberance on the edge of the great eurasian continent (namely Europe). A thousand years 
ago Europe was a barbarous, filthy fringe, and the light, wealth and music were to be found 
much further east. Times change, for all sorts of reasons,  and probably will again.

I'm also not convinced that it makes much sense to talk about `the West', as if there was a 
single, materialistic, spiritually impoverished, nature-conquering demon in residence in 
Europe and the European diaspora. Europe has a long, flourishing spiritual tradition. 
Europeans can - for better or worse - be quite as romantic about their past or their rural 
neighbours as `Indians'. Talk about `conquering nature' is not a specifically `Western' 
metaphor: it is neither confined to the west, nor universal in the west.
