Indology
Dear Michael and Jeson,
Several of us at Penn belong to the Indologist list, which is supposed 
to be dedicated to scholarly discussions on classical Indology. 
I have the instructions on how to join in my office, which I will 
forward to you both when I get back to town from the mountains.
