Dear co-member of INDOLOGY,

there are 3 french institutions that have a foot in India.

One is the CSH in Delhi (I don't know much about it)

The other two are the EFEO (Ecole Francaise d'Extreme-Orient)
and the IFP (Institut Francais de Pondicherry). The EFEO
is also represented in several Asian countries. Unfortunately,
they still cannot be contacted through E-mail although in
the near future it should be possible.

As a former member of EFEO, I can give you more details if
you wish so.

Yours sincerely.
