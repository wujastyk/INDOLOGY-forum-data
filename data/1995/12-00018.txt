I am looking for a text of the judgment delivered by Mr Justice Kuldip 
Singh and Mr Justice Hasaria concerning the provision of Sanskrit as 
option in October 1994. The writ petition was filed by Santosh Kumar and 
six others against the Central Board for Secondary Education. The 
judgement ordered the board to introduce Sanskrit as an option. Thanks
