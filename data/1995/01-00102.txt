Could anybody recommend me a book on Khmer? Ideally, it should have a
vocabulary of about 2000 words, a full grammar and be accompanied by a
tape. (In other words, pretty much like the books in the Teach Yourself ..
Series.) But I don't suppose there is a Teach Yourself Khmer around.

Best regards,
