-- PAPER:

        Michael Witzel 
        Harvard University

                         EARLY SANSKRITIZATION.

               ORIGINS AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE KURU STATE.

        SUMMARY
        
        The Mahabharata is, by and large, the tale of a great battle
        between two sections of the ancient Kuru people of the Haryana/W.
        Uttar Pradesh region, as told at the snake sacrifice of the
        post-battle Kuru king Pariksit. Since the Vedic texts are "tape
        recordings" of the Vedic period we can use them as basis for judging
        the less strict tradition of the Epics. To provide such a basis, the
        present paper is an investigation of the forces behind the
        formation of the Kuru realm at the end of the Rgvedic period.

        The emergence of the Kuru realm is of extraordinary importance as
        its civilization has influenced later Indian ritual, society
        and political formations, frequently even until today.
        Comments are welcome and will be published in a separate
        column of letters/discussion.
