Persian-, Arabic- & Osmaninc-fonts?
Dear members of the list,
a friend of mine has asked me to post this questin for her:
Does anybody know about ftp-sites or addresses where one can download/order
true-type-fonts (winword 6.0) useful for writing arabic, persian 
and osmanic tetxts? Any help is welcome!
