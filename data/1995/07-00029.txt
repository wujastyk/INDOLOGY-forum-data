Rajasthan Studies List
FYI.  David Magier
Rajasthan Studies List
Welcome to the RSG-L mailing list for Rajasthan Studies.
Carol Henderson and myself have discussed this and feel that the time
has come for the RSG(AAS) to make use of the new technology to
advance the cause of the study of Rajasthan. We are not quite certain
how this list can be used -- that is up to you -- but we feel it should
exist. Please feel free to use it to exchange ideas, project schemes, 
announcements, bibliography finds, news, or whatever.
If you decide to be a part of this list, please send the message:
     SUBSCRIBE RSG-L <fistname and lastname>
to LISTSERV at HAYNESE.WINTHROP.EDU
and you should be added to the list automatically. Let me know if
there are any problems in this regard.
If you have friends not on the list, please let them know of its
existence.
Let me know if you have any problems.
