Learning sanskrit
Enrica Garzilli;
Re: the price of the material.
1. Correspondence course, Bangalore: Fees; Rupees 100 
(one hundred only) for each part plus postal charges. 
Audio cassettes are also available at a reasonable 
price.
2. The cost of the album of cassettes from Mr. R. 
Sundaracharlu, Madras is approximately Rupees 1,500 
(one thousand five hundred only; I assume that the 
postal charges will be extra). Mr. Sundaracharlu and 
his wife have devoted quite a bit of time in the 
preparation, which has received a very good review 
from Sanskrit scholars in Madras.
Best wishes. Dr. Kalyanaraman.
PS. 1 USD = 31.3 Indian rupees.
