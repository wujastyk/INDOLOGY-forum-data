SOCIOLINGUISTIC QUESTIONS
I note that the recent discussion of "sociolinguistic questions" does not 
seem to be about "classical" India.  Should the initiator and respondents 
be censured?
Of course, I am not serious.  But I would suggest that the case 
illustrates problems with an overly rigid concept of what scholars 
dealing with classical India might find interesting.
