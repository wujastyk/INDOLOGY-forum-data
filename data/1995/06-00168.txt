Teaching Hinduism
Is there anyone out there interested in doing some replacement teaching at
Middlesex University (UK), for a year starting in September? If you do, or
would like to recommend someone else, then please contact Dr. Skorupski in
the first instance (0171-323-6248 or 0171-323-6137). Please don't come back
to me on this as I shall not be here.
