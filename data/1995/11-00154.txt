Just a short note on Bhart.rhari -- I-ching's dates have been the subject of
some controversy for quite some time. Judging from the Vaakyapadiyam, and other
facts known about Bhart.rihari, the 5th century is a more likely date for him.
I-ching treats Bhart.rhari as a contemporary of Dharmapaala, which is clearly
wrong, and his synopses of Bhart.rhari's works suggests he was not very
familiar with their contents.
