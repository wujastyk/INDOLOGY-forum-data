Prof. Bechert has no individual email-address. However, you can 
contact him via Dr. Klaus Wille at the Goettingen Seminar:

KWILLE at GWDG.DE



Reinhold Gruenendahl
Niedersaechsische Staats- und Universitaetsbibliothek
37070 Goettingen
Germany
Phone: 0551/395283

 
Chr. Lindtner has been dismissed from the University of Copenhagen some 
years ago and I doubt very much whether he is on e-mail. His private 
address is:

Tovesvej 6,
DK-2850 Naerum,
Denmark


Erik Reenberg Sand
Institute for the History of Religions
University of Copenhagen
Njalsgade 80
DK-2300 Kbh. S
Denmark
