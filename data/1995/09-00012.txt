honey in arka shrubs?

Is the situation hypothetical?  I can hardly imagine that honey
could ever be found in the wasteland shrub.  On the other hand the
contexts in which the verse is usually quoted are about avoiding
complicated ways of doing things when much simpler ones actually
exist."
I have not checked the references he gives, but in a Mimansa context, the
usual intent of such a sloka would be that if something desirable, like
heaven, or honey, could be gained without effort, then no intelligent person
would do something difficult, like performing Vedic sacrifices, or going to
the mountain, to obtain it. One can no more gain heaven without performing
Vedic sacrifices than he can obtain honey from the arka plant.
