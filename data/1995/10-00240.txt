Does anyone happen to know the email address of Michael Fisher and/or 
Paula Richman at Oberlin College?

Also, I am searching for information on the Rotary and Richter (Rickter?) 
Scholarships.  Does anyone happen to know who is eligible for such 
fellowships (i.e., is it open to "Asianists", undergrads, graduate 
students, or junior or senior faculty), who the contact people are, when 
the deadlines are, and/or what the reputation of these grants are?

Much obliged for your help in these matters.

Manu Bhagavan
