Poverty
Narayan Sriranga Raja said
Even a cursory reading of contemporary literature on the Indian economy
will show that it very far from being "a healthy well-educated young
person." The Indian economy has huge hurdles to overcome before it can
even begin to approach the performance of the Pacific Rim economies.
The reasons and examples are too many to go into here, and
inappropriate for the INDOLOGY forum in any case.
And the jibe about imperialism-qua-vampire precisely
begs the question that several of us have been trying
to discuss rationally.
