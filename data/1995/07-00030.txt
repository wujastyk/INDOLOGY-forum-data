Font Encoding
Peter Friedlander raised the issue of font/charset encodings in Asian
studies.
1/ There are the "code pages" supported by IBM and registered with the
ISO.  These are inadequate for Sanskrit etc.
2/ No official body has "legislated" for Indic languages in
transliteration, as far as I know.
3/  The CSX encoding, for all its limitations, is the nearest thing that
exists to a standard.
Sorry to be laconic: in a terrific hurry.
