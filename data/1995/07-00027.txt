Critical editions
Hope it won't change the subject too much to ask a mundane
question:
I do critical editions and stemmas of Tibetan scriptures. Paul
Harrison showed me how easy his task is made by using Nisus
for Mac; but, alas, my institution insists we all use IBM PC's,
so I need a software as good as Nisus but IBM compatible. Preferably,
I should be able to run it on Windows, another institutional requirement.
Any suggestions?
