Gold
It is a common practice in India to take old ornaments to a gold-smith to 
get new ones made out of the same mettle.  On such occasions, the 
goldsmiths go through this process of "purification" of the gold to 
remove impurities.  Secondly, the word "dhmaatam" is important.  One 
needs to go to an Indian goldsmith and see how they blow a flame on to 
the gold they are working with in order to shape and join little pieces.  
However, this is different from the process of purification where they 
place the gold in a container and heat it.  Of course these are modern 
practices I have seen in Pune.
