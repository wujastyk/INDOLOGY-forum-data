A. Villarroel's query
Mr. Lance Cousins; the Pali citation is fascinating: mahaamaatikaa connoting a 
great irrigation channel. Concordant phonemes: maTai small sluice of channel or 
stream, hole, shutters of a sluice, channel (Tamil); floodgate (Malayalam); maDa
small opening out of a channel into a field. I don't know how to interpret 
udaka-magga = canal; cf. maDugu pond, basin, pool (Telugu). For references on 
Pkt. khalla, I cited only lexemes; for more, cf. Turner CDIAL 3849. s. 
kalyanaraman.

There may well have been a number of terms.
In Pali:
At Dhs-a 269 mahaamaatikaa seems to be used (in a simile) to mean a 'great
irrigation channel'.
According to CPD udaka-magga means: 'a canal; the inlet and outlet of a tank'.
Have you references to confirm khalla in Skt and Pkt ? Or do they only
occur in lexical sources which may derive from the vernacular languages?
