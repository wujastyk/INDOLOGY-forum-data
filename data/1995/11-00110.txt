Midnight's Children
Lars Martin Fosse is reminded of Dandin when reading Rushdie.
I was also reminded of that great alamkarika, right from p. 1 of the
_Satanic Verses_, when the two protagonists, "fighting gravity with
levity," joke back an forth as they fall from a bombed airline to the
British Channel.
