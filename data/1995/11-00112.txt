When reading Midnight's Children some years ago it struck me that Rushdie
seems to owe a lot to the old Indic kath-a. He utilized motives and
personalities from Hindu mythology quite creatively, and I felt personally
that his storytelling was very South Asian. I may be wrong about his
sources of inspiration, but the Sanskrit stories by Dandin and other early
novelists and storytellers are certainly not foreign to the magical and
fantastic. (Read these guys, it's fun!). Anybody out there who have a
similar impression?
