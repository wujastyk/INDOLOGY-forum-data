"kaumudii"
Dear members.
In connection with the kumuda-discussion and several other postings
concerned with plant-topics I would like to ask for any references to
literature about the flowers/plants occuring in Sanskrit (Prakrit)
poetry, what are the poetical/mythological connotations of various plants in
Indian literature. Also, is there any attempt of botanical Sanskrit-Latin
(or whatever) dictionary which put more light on which plant is which than
the classical Skt dictionaries do? 
   To put it simply, any bibliography on plants in Skt liter. whether
general intro or specific monografies is wanted.
Thanks in advance again (not to post "thanks"messages after)
