More on "sarva"
Gillon's translation of the Sanskrit line leaves out the rhetorical force 
of the text.  The translation appears 'bland' in comparison with the 
original.  'Yaavaan kaScit pratizedhaH' could perhaps be rendered as 
'Whatsoever negation there is', 'sa sarvaH anupalabdheH': 'all that is 
[caused] by non-apprehension'.  Thus, in the original Sanskrit, I do not 
see any redundanncy, when we take the rhetorical force into account.  
Otherwise, in Sanskrit itself, from a purely propositional point of view, 
one could rephrase the sentence without the word sarva.
