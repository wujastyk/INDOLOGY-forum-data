Teaching Sanskrit (Rauravagaama)
         civa~naanabOtam & rauravaagama
        *********************************
Dominic is right, civa~naanabOtam (tamil) and Rauravaagama (sanskrit)
contain similar passages. (not the pauskaraagama as mentioned in my posting. 
I told that from memory, Sorry for the mistake.)
However, the debate about which one is the borrowing went on for decades
in Tamilnadu. There is a good book in tamil that gives 100+ reasons
showing civa~naanapOtam is the original and the rauravaagama portions
are borrowed ones.

civ~naanapOtam mutal nUlE, mozipeyarppu alla.
1949: Saiva siddhanta Mahasamajam, Madras.
The author, m. baalasubramania mudaliyaar (1896 - 1958) had an
assumed name, mayilai kizAr. His scholarly editions of tEvAram are
wellknown. tEvAram (critical edition) from French Institute 
of Indology, Pondichery heavily rely upon mayilai kizAr's editions.
