Of these works, Gonda's is the most thorough.
Remember that the knowledge of Sanskrit in Indonesian deteriorated at the
end of the middle ages, and that Sanskrit inscriptions in Indonesian
sometimes are erronous and may not always make sense.
The text "om sidhingastu nama ciwaya" may perhaps = om siddhir astu nama.h
/siv-aya = "om may there be success, hail to Shiva". But don't quote me. I
have no experience reading inscriptions in Indonesian Sanskrit.
