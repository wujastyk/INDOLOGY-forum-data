Subject: Indian art of Memory?
Message-ID: <161227020820.23782.145151883128882972.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>


Dear Indologists,

	I wonder if a book similar to F. A. Yates *The art of memory* ,
which retraces the history of memory and mnemotechniques in the European
tradition, has been written for India. Could anyone suggest one reliable
title or article? 

			Many thanks in advance.
