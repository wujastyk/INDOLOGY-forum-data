I was wondering if anyone happened to have the email addresses of Sandria 
Freitag and Ashutosh Varshney. Thanks for your help.

Re: Glossary of Sanskrit from Indonesia
Our records show there is no 1961 issue of Vak; Issues 1-5 were issued
1951-1957, and no. 6 in 1964; the Preface by the authors Ensink and Van
Buitenen does not refer to any prior publication of this "Glossary of Sanskrit
from Indonesia." The Preface itself is dated 1961; 1964 is from the cover.  I
hope this info is helpful.  William Alspaugh, U. of Chicago Library
