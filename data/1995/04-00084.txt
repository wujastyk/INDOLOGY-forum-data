DHIRC Working Group 
on 
Gender and the Vedic Tradition

The perspective of this working group is that close, textual or
ethnographic analyses of women in the Hindu tradition are not incompatible
with theoretical sophistication in gender studies.  In a series of annual
meetings, these emphases are joined. 

Our focus is fourfold: gender and ritual in Vedic tradition; gender and
mythology in Vedic tradition; gender and Vedic authority in the era of
Hindu reform; and gender and Vedic authority in postcolonial India. 
Research topics include gender issues in: the Vedic tradition itself;
texts and practices influenced by that tradition; and questions of Vedic
authority in recent history and politics, in both colonial and
contemporary India. 
     
The first annual meeting was held in April 1994.  This year we will
develop themes which were identified during these initial presentations
and discussions.  Following this yearUs meeting, we will collect selected
papers into an edited volume, te ntatively titled Gender and Vedic
Authority.

About DHIRC

The Dharam Hinduja Indic Research Center (DHIRC) was established within
the Department of Religion at Columbia University in May 1994 with three
primary goals: 

(a) promoting research on Indic traditions; 

(b) addressing practical problems of the modern world, including science,
medicine, and gender issues; and

(c) advancing the causes of tolerance and interreligious understanding. 

Much of DHIRCUs research work is undertaken by its five working groups,
which draw together scholars with shared concerns in: 

     *Gender and the Vedic Tradition
     *Science and the Vedic Tradition
     *Research in Ayurveda
     *Vedanta and Conflict Resolution
     *The Relevance of the Veda
