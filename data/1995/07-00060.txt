The transliteration scheme you are describing is designed for the input
of Sanskrit using only 7-bit ASCII characters.  It was designed by Frans
Velthuis for use with his Devanagari TeX package and is fully documented
in a file called manual.tex that is distributed with that package.  The
package is called devnag.zip (or something like that).
