moderating not moderation
A discussion on Paul Tillich on Buddhism would be most appropriate and 
informative, in the critico-comparative interest. Or, when discussing 
Plato and Platonism, should one be debarred from making reference to 
Arabic thinkers such as Avicenna, Averroes, down to say Al-Ghazzali, and 
elsewhere to Maimonides and Spinoza?
