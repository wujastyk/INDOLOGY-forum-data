My understanding is that USEFI is a separate foundation, partly
supported by US government funding, which serves as a kind of umbrella
support service for all sorts of research and scholarly activities,
such as Fulbright Program scholarly exchanges (in both directions), as
well as local logistical support for scholars arriving in India on
AIIS or other auspices.
