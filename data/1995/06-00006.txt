Wilson's 1855 work: reprints
What a great group indology members are: I got a response to the following
query promptly and with a lot of kindness: Reprints are: 1968, by Munshiram
Manoharlal, Delhi and 1985 by Muqtadirah-yI Qaumi ZabAn, Islamabad. I am
deeply grateful for this information proovided to me by Jage and Magier. 
I may add, that this Wilson's work is a pioneering and an outstanding
contribution to indology (etyma of lingua franca in particular) made by the
East India Company.
"I am interested in acquiring the following out-of-print book; indology
members may kindly help me with contact numbers or email of booksellers who
may be able to sell me a copy:

government of British India from the Arabic, Persian, Hindustani, Sanskrit,
Hindi, Bengali, uriya, marathi, guzarathi, telugu, karnata, tamil, malayalam,
and other languages, W.H.Allen and Co., London, MDCCCLV (1855)"
