Gary,
Isn't someone fullfilling all aspects of genocide a fashist?Even if this
word was born here in Germany,if there isn't yet another word for it which
can be used when talking about situations in other countries,there is no
reason to call fascism communalism?I think if you do that you don't know
what you are talking about.
