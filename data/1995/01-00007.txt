Einstein and the Dance of Siva (fwd)
May I say (undoubtedly on behalf of all my colleagues on INDOLOGY)
that it is quite an honor -- and un undeniable thrill -- to receive
postings to INDOLOGY from Rolf Sinclair from somewhere as remote as
McMurdo Station! Good luck on your journey to the Pole, and please do
keep in touch with us!
