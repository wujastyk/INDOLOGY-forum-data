     I thought it was too good to be true. Therefore, I called. Mr I. Green
talked to me and was very frank about this offer. He has no problem in
returning your money if you were not happy with his fonts.

I am sending my check. At this stage I am not recommending that anybody
follow my example. If the members of this group trust me and allow me to
report the veracity of this offer and the quality of the product at my cost,
I would be willing to report the outcome in a week. Why am I wasting
my $100.00 on an offer that sounds so phony? Well, no pain no gain.
I like to live dangerously. A sucker is born every minute.
