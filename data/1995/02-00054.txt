% I am now assembling mss. for a critical edition of the Kamasutram with a
% new English translation.  Having noted the accessibility of most
% non-published mss. in Indian archives, libraries, etc., I am now trying
% to locate the availability of the same in museums and odther collections
% in the U.S. and Europe.  If you know of such holdings, please contact me
% at my e-mail address.  I am interested in Sanskrit mss. which do and do
% not contain Indian miniature paintings, line drawings, etc.  THANKS!
