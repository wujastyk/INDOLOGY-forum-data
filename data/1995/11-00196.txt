#This is Incredible - My sister told me this "old sanskrit poem" last
#week, and that she used it in a toast recently. I asked her the
#source but she didn't know where "exactly" she got it from. But it
#sounded nice, so I wrote it down and came back to Palmerston North
#with the idea of posting it to the list sometime asking if someone
#knew where it first occurs!!!!
#
#As far as I know my sister isn't doing a course on Indian Buddhism.
#I'll believe that it was quoted in Reader's Digest, though.  Seems
#very likely.
