This is in response to a recent query concerning summer study programs in
India. Taxila Academy, a new program in Bangalore, India, which offers 
introductory courses in: 

Language Study
Epics and Mythology
Art and Architecture
Cinema and Society
Classical Music and Dance
Modern Indian Literature

It has been organized by students and professors at the University of 
Chicago, Oxford, Jawaharlal Nehru University and Delhi University.

If anyone is interested, I can provide more information.

Aditya.
