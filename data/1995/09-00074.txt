Sankara biographies
In response to the query about lives of Sankara on Indology a couple of 
weeks ago, W.R. Antarkar, retired from Khalsa College, Bombay, edited a number of 
traditional lives of Sankara. He gave me offprints of them and I had to 
rummage around a while to find them. A list follows:
