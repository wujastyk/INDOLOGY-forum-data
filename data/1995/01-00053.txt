thanks to Rolf Sinclair
Hi Rolf,
thank you so much for your answer to my query. What a coincidence: 
you are on your way to the South Pole; I am a Southern (by spirit) 
Pole and one of Shiva's forms is a pole (or lin-ga). The texts I got 
from you inspired me to think about the nature of Shiva in a new way. 
Many scholars put a stress on Shiva's ambiguity. He rules both 
fertily and destruction. Also, in the exchange of letters I got I can 
trace some signs of this duality but they are very subtle and this 
subtility led me to the thought of the fundamental impossibility of 
distinguishing between creation and destruction (especially in the 
shaivaite context). When you create anything something (eg some 
material) vanishes; when something vanishes new things (eg broken 
pieces) show up. This is only the limited perspective of a person (or 
a "mask"; I would not like to say "individual" as for me the very 
"individual" would be Shiva himself) that makes this asessment 
possible. All things are proper parts of a good play. Pralaya too is 
such a part.
