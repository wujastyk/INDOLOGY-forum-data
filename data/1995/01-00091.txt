Thanks to those who have responded to my "Reflections on INDOLOGY".

May I ask for further letters and poems on this subject to sent directly
to me?  My address is dom at vigyan.iisc.ernet.in.

Some correspondents are already doing this, for which many thanks.

I can summarize the postings for INDOLOGY after some time, if people
wish.

Dominik
