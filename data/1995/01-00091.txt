Discussion of my "Reflections on INDOLOGY"
Thanks to those who have responded to my "Reflections on INDOLOGY".
May I ask for further letters and poems on this subject to sent directly
to me?  My address is dom at vigyan.iisc.ernet.in.
Some correspondents are already doing this, for which many thanks.
I can summarize the postings for INDOLOGY after some time, if people
wish.
