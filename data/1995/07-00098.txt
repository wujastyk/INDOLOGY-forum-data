I suspect that this is a non-problem so long as the font is only used on a
Mac. There are a rather large number of fonts in InterNet archives for Mac
shareware which are simple modifications of the fonts which come with the
Mac. Apple has made no attempt to restrict this and almost certainly
doesn't intend to do so.

I think it is quite safe to use any such font on a Mac. It might be
different elsewhere, since Apple may not be the copyright holder or license
holder for this version of Times on other machines.
