unsubscribing
Yes that sounds more reasonable. But we should be careful to keep the
header brief (as someone once said, "on the internet, long = noise") (or
something like that!). 
        I believe the list server already has an automated help file. Why
not just give enough info in the header so that everyone knows how to
download the help file.
