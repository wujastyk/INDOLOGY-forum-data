Critique of India

This is debatable. Spain was under Muslim rule for 500 years, but still
remained Christian (of course, Christians were more favoured than Hindus).
Even if Hindu culture hadn't been fragmented, it would probably have
survived. Of course, different degrees of fragmentation is found in all
societies, and to the extent that fragmentation is the a reason for India's
miseries, it is so because of its extent. My impression is that political
systems or states seem less stable in India than in Europe (off the cuff,
approximately 200 years seem to be the maximum extent for a state formation
in India), although Europe certainly has had a lot of wars and instability
- in this century, we have started two world wars. To check this out, we
would have to compile statistics on the duration of dynasties and the
stability of state formations in both areas. Here I feel rather
incompetent. Comments from others are invited.
I agree that the discussion is worth-while, but I don't share the feeling
that we are defensive. So far, the arguments have been quite academic and
to the point from both sides. Comparing the effect of historical and
cultural forces is important, and we shouldn't be afraid of a bit of bias
on both sides. It is unavoidable and the only way to kill it is to get it
out in the open.
