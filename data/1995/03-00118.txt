I am forwading a note I received from a dear friend for everyone. Enjoy!

The following is a blurb that I've prepared about Chetana. Would really
appreciate it if you would suggest newsgroups I could forward this to.
Or maybe just forward this note itself. Or to friends!
Please pardon if it is cross-posted.

linking the teachings of the Gita to Management.

Chetana's Mission:
=================
Chetana is not merely a business. It is a celebration of all that
is noble and wise in Indian thought. It was started in 1946, by
founder Sudhakar Dikshit, with high ideals to promote and to
propagate India's universal spiritual heritage, with emphasis on
the study of its philosophy and culture.

I Am That
=========
Chetana is also a publishing house. Our books on Vedanta, namely
"I Am That" -- the teachings of Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj and the
writings of modern masters such as J. Krishnamurti are acclaimed
worldwide as classics of spiritual literature. "I Am That" is
now in its 10th edition.

Robert Powell, author of "Return to Meaningfulness", remarked
when he read I AM THAT that he was "deeply impressed and moved
by its wisdom and eloquence." To his mind "Nisargadatta ranks
with the great Upanishadic teachers." We reproduce an extract
from the chapter in I AM THAT entitled "Desirelessness - The
Highest Bliss":

+--- Extract from "I Am That":  --------------------------------+
| "Your own Self is your ultimate teacher (Sadguru). The outer  |
|  teacher (Guru) is merely a milestone. It is only your inner  |
|  teacher, that will walk with you to the goal. ...Since He is |
|  in you and with you...look within, and you will find Him."   |
