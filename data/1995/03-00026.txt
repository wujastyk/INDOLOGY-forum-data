Not Indological, but Very Useful:
Phoneday - 16 April 1995 - A Final Reminder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
On 16 April all UK dialling codes will change, by the insertion of a "1"
after the initial 0 of the UK dialling code (or after the "44" for
people dialling into the UK).
Please remember to re-programme numbers stored in FAX machines, modems
and elsewhere since after April 16 the old dialling codes will no longer
work.
The other important changes are that the international dialling code
from within the UK is changing, and the dialling code for five cities is
being completely revised.
