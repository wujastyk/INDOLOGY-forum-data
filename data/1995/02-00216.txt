The Meaning of Patrika
Hello,
   I am writing to you all from the New Jersey Medical School, Newark, 
NJ, USA. I have a question that may or may not be appropriate for this list.
At our school, we have an newly formed Indian Student Association and 
have named our newsletter "Patrika." To us, that means "letter." I was 
wondering if some scholars on the Net can help identify any other possible
meanings for this word. Thanks.
