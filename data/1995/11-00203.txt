Sanskrit grammars
Hello all of you and Peter in particular.
Thanks for the reply concerning my query about a Sanskrit grammatical text 
entitled *Rajashri*. Peter Verhagen's note via Bu ston ultimately goes 
back to Khro phu Lo tsa ba Byams pa'i dpal's autobiography in which he 
writes that, while in the Kathmandu Valley in the mid 1190s, he studied 
this work with Buddhashri. Being the recipient of all the transmissions 
that issued from Khro phu Lo tsa ba, it is likely that the autobiography 
was Bu ston's source for this title. Still going round in circles!
Again, merci for the time taken,
Leonard
