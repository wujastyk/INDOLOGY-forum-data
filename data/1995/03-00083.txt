Members of the list,
I have a question regarding the word "nyagrodha",
which occurs in the Chandogya Up.
According to Monier-Williams it can be both
a banyan tree (which would agree with the description
of growing downwards) and a fig tree. 
I am not aware of any fig trees that grow downwards.
Any suggestions?
Edeltraud.
