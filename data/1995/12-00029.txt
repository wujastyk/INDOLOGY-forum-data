Subject: Summer Programs in Sinhalese?
Message-ID: <161227021943.23782.13207118507174164982.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>


As the South Asia Gopher did not contain any information regarding the 
subject, I shall ask it here: Do any universities or colleges in the United 
States - preferrably on the West Coast - give instruction in Elementary 
Sinhalese?

Thanks.
