In view of the many expressions of interest received the editors of the
Journal of Buddhist Ethics are pleased
to announce that the proposed conference is now ON and will take place
between the above dates.
Please note that as the medium of the conference will be email, there is no
need to be CONTINUOUSLY available between these dates, although it would be
desirable to have regular access to a terminal for the duration of the
conference.

philosophical nature and deal with contemporary or historical themes in the
general field of Buddhism and Human Rights. Papers should be around 5,000
words in length and must be received by August 31st 1995. Please contact the
editors if you would like to discuss a proposal for a paper.
