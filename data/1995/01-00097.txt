unsubscribing
        To those generous souls who have taken on the thankless task of
administrating the list:
        May I suggest that you prepare a short info sheet with a brief
statement of the goals of Indology and a list of the most useful commands
(subscribe, etc.) and that you post it regularly (once every month or two).
        I know everyone gets something like that on joining, but these
things can easily be lost due to inattention, floppy failure or by the
general influence of time. If a list-info-posting were to appear every
month, the regulars of the list would know to ignore it, but would know
where to look if they want to do something different or introduce a friend
to the list.
