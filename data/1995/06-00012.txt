Urdu textbook for children
Dear Members of the Indology Net:
I am looking for a textbook or textbooks that teach basic Urdu to a child
of seven whose mother tongue is English.  He knows some Urdu, but probably
not enough to be able to use the dual language readers of the sort that are
available here and in the U.K.  He does not know the Urdu writing system.
Any suggestions would be most appreciated.  Thank you.
