Berkeley address
Sorry to use the space for this message, but I am getting understandably 
frustrating notes from friends and colleagues sent via my Australian 
e-mail address as the L.A. address works only .76 times and I don't have 
remote access to it. I am in Berkeley, folks, at the Dept of South & 
South-east Asian Studies/Philosophy. continuing my visiting function, 
etc. the e-mail address is:
pbilimor at garnet.berkeley.edu
