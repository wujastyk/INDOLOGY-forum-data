Message-ID: <161227019803.23782.10593877674053401175.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I shall be thankful for info. [or references to
literary/epigraphical sources] on the socio-economic
significance attached to winter solstice
festivals in India; in particular, the ancient
economic practices related to the sharing of winter 
crops on the
auspicious day of the
sankrAnti (or apparent celestial shift of the sun
from the zodiacal sign of cancer to capricorn).

E.g., bhogi in South India, roHRi in Punjab,
bhogya in Assam.
