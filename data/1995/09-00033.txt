INDIAN ART OF MEMORY?
          A computer search has  failed  to  find anything for mnemonics in 
          India.  There is much about memorization scattered in writings on 
          education  in  India,  and  a  little  on  specific techniques in 
          memorizing the Vedas.  I  have found no evidence for  a conscious 
          technique of memorization using VISUAL images as  in  the Western 
          ars memoriae.  Someone needs  to research the topic and write  it 
          up.
