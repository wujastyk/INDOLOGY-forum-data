Dear Pramit,

Pramit is indeed a rather common name in Thai with exactly the etimology 
mentioned earlier by Mr. Kalyanaraman, i.e. in Thai it is spelled pramitr, where
'pra' is a particle to add emphasis and 'mitr' means 'friend'.

Congratulations, it is an excellent and truly Sanskritic name.

Sincerely,

Sajjaa.
