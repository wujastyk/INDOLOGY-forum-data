Dear Pramit,
Pramit is indeed a rather common name in Thai with exactly the etimology 
mentioned earlier by Mr. Kalyanaraman, i.e. in Thai it is spelled pramitr, where
'pra' is a particle to add emphasis and 'mitr' means 'friend'.
Congratulations, it is an excellent and truly Sanskritic name.
Sincerely,
Sajjaa.
