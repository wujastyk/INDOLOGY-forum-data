  Well, barring those who don't care for cocktail parties, my initial 
query on the alleged "Sanskrit proverb" generated a few responses (thanks 
to the person who responded to me directly regarding a possible link to 
the Dhammapada).  It certainly is curious to find how ubiquitous this 
little ditty has apparently become.  If it is a staple of greeting cards 
and if it is in fact being passed off as something genuine from the 
"Sanskrit", I for one would still be interested to see if that claim can be 
substantiated.  As Lance Cousins suggests it has such a generic flavor of 
"deep thoughts" that one really doubts the claim.  But then, if you 
take the first two verses of the Dhammapada and render them with *extreme* 
license could you come up with this poem (Mascaro's Penguin trans. seems 
to move in this direction--though I hesitate to raise the matter of 
Penguin translations!).
 Anyone care to continue this thread, or shall we close up the bar?
