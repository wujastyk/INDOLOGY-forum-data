History of Religions Congress (fwd)
Dear Colleague,
	The 17th International Congress of History of Religions will be 
held in Mexico City from August 5 to 12 of this year.  Several of the 
symposia in this conference will have to do with topics relevant to 
Indology.  Three of these are being organized by scholars connected 
with the India area of the Center of Asian and African Studies of El 
Colegio de Mexico.  These three symposia are:
	1. Devotion and Devotional Movement in India, coordinated by 
Prof. R.V. Joshi (e-mail to either of following).
	2. Devotional Literature in Medieval India, coordinated by Prof.
David Lorenzen (lorenzen at colmex.mx).
	3. Art and Religious Iconography, coordinated by Prof. Benjamin
Preciado (bprecia at colmex.mx). 
	There is still room for a couple more papers in each of these
three symposia.  Time, however, is short since the congress organizing
committee wants the program to be complete by the second week of February. 
If anyone out there would like to submit a paper proposal for one of these
symposia, please send an e-mail message to that effect directly to either
Benjamin Preciado or David Lorenzen, including a paper title and a
half-page abstract.  We promise to give a prompt reply and to send further
information about the Congress, including a form for reserving rooms at
reduced rates in several hotels.  The Congress organizing committee is not
able to finance travel or lodging expenses of the participants.  The 
Congress inscription fee is $200 U.S. 
	We look forward to hearing from you,
		R.V. Joshi
		Benjamin Preciado
		David Lorenzen
