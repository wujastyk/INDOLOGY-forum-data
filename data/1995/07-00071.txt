Subject: Seeking Sanskrit fonts for Windows 3.1

Greetings,
	I want to typeset some text in Devanagari and with a Roman
transliteration font.  If you are aware of sources for Microsoft Windows-comp
compatible (preferably TrueType) fonts for Devagari and transliteration (with
diacriticals for long vowels, dots under d,s,t, etc.), please contact me.
	A reference to vendors or repositories (gopher, archie, etc.) will 
suffice.  Also, if you can pass this along or recommend people who might advise
me, I will be grateful.
	Thanks to all in advance.
	Please respond to 102011.2245 at compuserve.com (preferred) or to 
jwalkup at blue.uiowa.edu.

Cheers, James Walkup  Iowa City, USA and Calicut District, Kerala
