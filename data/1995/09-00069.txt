It might be interesting to note in this context what Johannes Hertel says
in his Einleitung to his Tantraakhyaayika, 1910, p. XXIV ? 2. Schreibung
und Satzzeichen (Spelling and Punctuation) under para. 1 b.: "Zischlaut,
Upaadhmaaniiya und Jihvaamuuliiya verwende ich mit den Handschriften statt
des im eigentlichen Indien ueblichen Visarga" (I am using the sibilants u?s
and j?s as the manuscripts do instead of the usual visarga in India
itself). The context is the Kashmiri recensions that he used.
