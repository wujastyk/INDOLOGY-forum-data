Well, in Calcutta, last December, 40 rupees could buy you at least four
street stalls meals. After all in most Indian towns a samosa cost between
one and 2 rupees and a long taxi ride is about 10 rs (Indian price...). So
obviously the problem is far less the amount, in dollars, earned by
individuals, than the amount of things they can buy with it.
