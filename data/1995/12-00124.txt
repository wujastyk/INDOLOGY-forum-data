Subject: Muslims -- not a "problem"
Message-ID: <161227022116.23782.2431435275981367967.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

For a very nicely composed study of conversion to Islam in India I would
recommend reading Richard M. Eaton's "The Rise of Islam and the Bengal
Frontier 1204-1760."  Chapter 5, "Mass Conversion toIslam: Theories and
Protoganists" offers a devastating crique of the forced-conversion
thesis and several others.  

I previously alluded to one of his more interesting points when pointing
to the fact that there is a relative paucity of Muslims in the central
region of Sultanate and Mughal rule, the region around Delhi, as
compared to the density of Muslim population in Bengal, where Muslims in
political power were far less significant.
