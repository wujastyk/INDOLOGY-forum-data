As I wrote in my announcement, our Pancanga program was written by
TurboPascal and runs by IBM and its compatible.  You can not run it
by Mac. But if you are interested in the program itself, you can
look at it by downloading pancang2.pas which is a plain text file.
Anyway pancang2.uu is not BINARY but uuencoded to ASCII file so
that you can download it as ordinary text file.

PS It seems that our ftp machine is working well.
