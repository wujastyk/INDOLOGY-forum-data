Nepal Studies: Past and Present
We have just received a letter that for various reasons requires an 
official response on the letterhead of The Nepal Studies: Past and 
Present, GPO Box 2531, Kathmandu, signed by Mrs. Indu Joshi, Vice 
President. I assumed this was a periodical but I can't find any such 
title on various databases.  Does anyone know anything about this 
organization?  I would be very grateful for any information, and for 
getting it quickly.
Thanks,
Allen Thrasher
