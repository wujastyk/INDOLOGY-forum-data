I have a rough note which says that Lokesh Chandra gives references to th
Buddha preaching to Viruupaaksha in ? either the language of the borders or
in Dravi.da:
Ludwik Sternbach Felicitation Volume, Part One, p. 496 (Akhila Bharatiya
Sanskrit Parishad, Lucknow, 1979).

It is interesting to note that Viruupaaksha was an important deity in
Vijayanagara.
