I got acquainted with CSX by FTPing it from ftp.bcc.ac.uk I think, and the
font is named CSX.VGA. I really cannot find there e,o with macrons! There is
only e,o with the sign (don't know its name) for short vowel (a crescent or
halfcircle over the vowels). Do I have some outdated version of this font?

Also, Jonathan Silk mentioned Prof.Deshpande's Manjushree-CSX font, what
kind of font is this? Are there several variants of CSX ?  Can CSX be
considered really an interindological encoding, to which one should export
his files to make them most easy to share?
