Subject: Burning Glasses in Ancient India
Message-ID: <161227019227.23782.9862705381465584722.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

A hearty 'Thank you' to all who have responded to my request for information
on burning glasses in ancient India.  Professor Witzel's reference to
the Rau piece looks especially promising.  I believe I missed some
postings in response to my post, for my host computer went down for 24
hours shortly after I sent the item and the item itself never came to me.
I am going to have to search out the command to recover the missing
posts from the list-server archive.  If you sent me a personal response
and do not hear from me in the next day or two, could I ask you please to
retransmit it?

Thanks, Jim Fitzgerald
