TrueType fonts in Computer Sanskrit etc.
 It probably is vastly outdated by CSX, but I would like to mention that
 I have been using a truetype font for romanized Sanskrit with my students
 for about two years now. A subset of Times, it comes in Windows and Mac form
 and - this is probably the main advantage - it converts nicely between opera-
 ting systems if you are using MS-Word or Winword.
 Anybody interested?

Dear Dr. Magnuszewska, you could try Virendra Singh in Benares.
I do not have his address, but if you go to Benares you could
try to contact him through the Visconsin Hindi language program.
Good luck, Edeltraud.
