Bookstores in Madras?
There is in fact an indology bookshop near Shanti Vihar restaurant
in Luz on the street leading into Vidya Mandir School, I forget the
exact name of the street, but it is very easy to locate. That is
where I bought my Sanskrit dictionary and several other books. They
also stock many OUP titles.
