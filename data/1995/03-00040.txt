verification of date
I wonder if one of the knowledgeable people on the list could help 
this astronomical dunce in verifying a date given in Saptar.si 
(Laukika) era, without the century. My struggles with Sewell's tables 
have thus far only succeeded in addling my brains yet further. The 
date is given as sa.m 64 bhaa (i.e. Bhaadra(pada)) "su (i.e. 
"suklapak.se) di (i.e. divase) .sa.s.thyaa.m bhaume. I would  
guess, on other grounds, that the date might be one in the late 
nineteenth century.
I shall greatly appreciate any help.
