Replying only to the original sender
A few days back, there was a question about how to send the replys only to
the person who posted the message rather than all the members. After
some experimentation, I think that I have one possible solution. This
basically consists of using a perl script to change the "Reply-To"
field to be the same as the "From:" field. This will work only if you
are using an Unix system; it is best if you filter your incoming mail
to seperate the mailing list messages from others. Let me know if you
want to take a look at the script.
Of course, you can always mail a message manually to the address given in
the "From:" field :-).
It would be nice if the Reply-To field is set by the list software itself.
We can reply to the list by using the "replyall" command or its equivalent.
