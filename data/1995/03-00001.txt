PICTURE OF SAVITRI
          A  library patron  has requested help  in  finding some  work  of 
          Indian fine  art illustrating the  story  of Savitri and Satyavan 
          for use in publishing a translation or version of it.   Is anyone 
          aware of one of the top of their head? 
          Thanks,
