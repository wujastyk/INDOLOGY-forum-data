Presumably this is *the* William Roxburgh (1751-1815), the second
Superintendent of the Calcutta Botanic garden, who wrote the _Flora
Indica_ and the _Plants of the coast of Coromandel_, and who
corresponded at length with Joseph Banks about the vegetable life of
India?   Half the plants in India were identified by him.  A very
remarkable pioneer of Indian botany.
