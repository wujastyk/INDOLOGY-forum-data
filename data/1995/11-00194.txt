Sanskrit font
Ahoi Peter,
Thank you very much for your reply.Just on Sunday I found a font on the
Yamada's Language page,but when trying out I can't find the short 'u'.Is
there you or someone else to say me that a font for Hindi- isn't that for
use for sanskrit or is there something wrong with my eyes?
