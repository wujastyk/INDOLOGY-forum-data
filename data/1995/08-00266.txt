Honey in arka shrubs
Perhaps the citation does not refer to honey but to the apparently 
well-known sweet smell of the arka plant. Cf. for instance the 
Ga"u.davaho of Vappa"iraaya (Vaakpatiraaja), Verse 535,  BSPS 34, from 
the section describing the charms of the forest:
 	iha viisama"iva hiyaya.m phullakkasamiirasurahigandhesu
 	aavaayagha.diyakamalaamoesu va.nantamaggesu GV 535 (ara.nyavar.nanam)
The Nyaaya may thus imply that since a sweet fragrance can be obtained 
from the common arka shrub there is no need to bother with costly 
perfumed fragrances acquired from inaccessible mountain regions. But I do 
not know if any of the arka varieties actually smell pleasant.
