moderation

Indology list. Is there a another list for which such topics would be 
more appropriate?
Thinking back on this last year, the majority of items that seem to come 
through have little, if anything, to do with the intended topic of 
discussion of this list: classical indology.  Perhaps, the purpose of the 
list should be further clarified.
I am not really sure if there is a need for moderation but rather for 
individuals to follow 'netiquette' (from Erica Garzilli's submission not 
to long ago) in what it is posted to this list.  
is not relevant. 
This is quite true!!!
if they  are "moderated out".
As mentioned above.  There are a number of list available out there in 
cyberspace which are appropriate to certain kinds of discussions.  I am 
sure that individuals who share an interest in areas outside of classical 
indology will find them an intereting and enjoyable place to discuss and 
exchange ideas.
