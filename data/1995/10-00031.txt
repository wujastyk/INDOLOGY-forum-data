Dear Dr. Hueckstedt,
	I got a forwarded message that you had trouble getting access to 
ASNIC.  I do not know how you got the address.  It was a wrong address.  
Our correct address is:
	http://asnic.utexas.edu/asnic/index.html

In the address cited in your message the word "index" was left out. 
Please type the above address and see if you still have any problem.  I 
am sure you will have no problem.  Please let me know how you find now.  I 
would also be grateful to you if you would suggest how we can make our page 
more useful.  Thank you very much.  

Sincerely, 
Kamal Adhikary

Dear Dr. Hueckstedt and other members of the Indology list:

The URLS you have posted below for ASNIC and SAGAR are both correct and 
are both working.  I just checked both addresses, and they seem fine.  

As I am not sure what the trouble is, I have forwarded this 
message on to <kamal at asnic.utexas.edu>, the Asian Studies Internet 
Coordinator at UT.

Has anyone else had similar problems?
