Q: URL addresses (fwd)
Dear Dr. Hueckstedt,
	I got a forwarded message that you had trouble getting access to 
ASNIC.  I do not know how you got the address.  It was a wrong address.  
Our correct address is:
	http://asnic.utexas.edu/asnic/index.html
In the address cited in your message the word "index" was left out. 
Please type the above address and see if you still have any problem.  I 
am sure you will have no problem.  Please let me know how you find now.  I 
would also be grateful to you if you would suggest how we can make our page 
more useful.  Thank you very much.  
Sincerely, 
Kamal Adhikary

Re: Q: URL addresses
Dear Dr. Hueckstedt and other members of the Indology list:
The URLS you have posted below for ASNIC and SAGAR are both correct and 
are both working.  I just checked both addresses, and they seem fine.  
As I am not sure what the trouble is, I have forwarded this 
message on to <kamal at asnic.utexas.edu>, the Asian Studies Internet 
Coordinator at UT.
Has anyone else had similar problems?
