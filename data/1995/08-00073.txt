Norman diacritic fonts for Macintosh
I'm wondering about your problem. I had no trouble connecting and downloading
the Norman fonts last week. Could it be a problem at your end? Incidentaly, I used the WWW address as ftp://bombay.oriental.cam.ac.uk. Perhaps you could try
that. Best of luck. Julian Woods
