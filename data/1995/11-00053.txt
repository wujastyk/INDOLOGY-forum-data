Oppenheimer indeed taught himself Sanskrit and read the Bhagavat Gita fairly
extensively. There is a NOVA program (in the PBS TV in the US) where  he  is
shown quoting in english, that he felt like a manifestation of death himself
when the first atomic explosion took place in the desert in New Mexico. -JM.
