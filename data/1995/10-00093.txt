Isn't Sanskrit but the refinement of prakrt? The many phonetic peculiarities
of thousands of head-words (for e.g. recorded in Turner's magnum opus) 
recorded in the so-called indo-aryan tongues attest to this. 
Cousin's point is well made. Lexemes have to be accepted not with a grain
bt a bag of salt. Take the attempts at the translation of the Rgveda; aren't
many words explained based on prakrt forms (apart from contextual, 
sentence-based, internal consistency tests etc.)?
