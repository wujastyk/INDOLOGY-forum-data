          The 1905 ed. has been microfiched by  the Library of Congress and 
          can be ordered from this address: 
           
          Library of Congress 
          Photoduplication Service 
          Washington, DC 20540-5230 
          USA 
          tel: 202-707-5640 
          fax: 202-707-1771. 
           
          The number  of  the  fiche  is  SAIR 81\00170.  It consists of  9 
          fiches. 
           
          The  price  is  $1.75  per  fiche  plus  a  $5.00 processing fee. 
          Payment is necessary in advance, by check, credit card  (Visa  or 
          Mastercard), money order  drawn  on  a  U.S.  bank, international 
          money order, or UNESCO coupon.  Checks and money orders should be 
          payable to "Library of Congress." Customers paying by credit card 
          may order by fax.  I have stated the prices from  a handout sheet 
          provided by Photoduplication and would advise writing them to get 
          the exact price before sending in your order.  They do  not  take 
          or communicate about orders by eMail yet.
