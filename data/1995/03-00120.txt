          The number  of  the  fiche  is  SAIR 81\00170.  It consists of  9 
          fiches.

          payable to "Library of Congress." Customers paying by credit card 
          may order by fax.  I have stated the prices from  a handout sheet 
          provided by Photoduplication and would advise writing them to get 
          the exact price before sending in your order.  They do  not  take 
          or communicate about orders by eMail yet.
