There are some etyma for 'whirl': ghuurN to move to and fro (Sanskrit); curi = 
whirl; cuZHi = whirlpool (Tamil); I do not know if they are relatable to Tibetan
khor ba.

Is there in this list of roots anything which would explain the Tibetan
'khor ba, which literally means "to circle."  I have heard Tibetan
commentaries on this term in Buddhist Tibetan which make it seem as if it is
a word for "whirlpool."  Any basis in Indo-European linguistics for that?
