          I forgot to mention that I am pretty sure a few years ago I saw a 
          photographic reprint of  an early ed.  of  the Adbhutasagara, but 
          the  LOC cooperative acquisitions program doesn't  seem  to  have 
          picked it  up.   You  could write Motilal Banarsidass to  see  if 
          there is such a reprint; the address is: 
           
          Motilal Banarsidass 
          Bungalow Road 
          Jawahar Nagar
