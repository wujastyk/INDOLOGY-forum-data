Through the kindness of Nandakish Abhyankar, a list of 128,000 Sanskrit
words has been made available at the INDOLOGY supplementary ftp site.
The easiest way to access this and other files is via the INDOLOGY web page:
http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgadkw/indology.html (see fourth page).  Plain
ftp from ftp.bcc.ac.uk:/pub/users/ucgadkw/indology will also work.
Look for the files sanskrit-wordlist.zip and sanskrit-wordlist.readme.

The wordlist is based on the Tokunaga Mahabharata and Ramayana files; it
still requires some massaging to be usable, for instance, in a spelling
checker, but it provides an very useful basis for such a tool.

Many thanks, Nandu.

Dominik
