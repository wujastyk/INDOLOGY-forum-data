I am very interested in the subject connecting Shiva and Einstein. As 
I have just joined the indology list I am not in the know about the 
subject yet. Could anybody forward me some piece of information 
about the ideas which were raised please? I am working on Kashmiri 
Shaiva so naturally I would be happy to get in contact with research 
workers in this field.

            Thanking all helpful persons
