If you are looking for WordPerfect 5/5.1 for DOS, I have created some
fonts, HP Laserjet II printer files, macros, etc. that are available
from Dominick's FTP server listed below (among other places) as
WPSKRIT.EXE (a self-extracting .zip file). I should update the
package soon (i.e., Real Soon Now), as I have put together WP6.0
files and changed a few things to make the printer files also work
for HP4 printers (the built in scalable fonts demanded a more precise
point size calculation than WP5.1 provided). The fonts are not
CS/CSX, but I believe I included macros to translate back and forth.
Good luck,
