correction re arka etc.
I forgot to apologize for and correct an error.  At least according to my 
unabridged dictionary Jimson weed is a Datura, not a milkweed.
Also, Calotropis is not a "little" shrub, growing to the height of an 
American male.  Lots of things smaller than that count as "trees" in 
Sanskrit.
