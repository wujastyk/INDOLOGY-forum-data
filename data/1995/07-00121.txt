compact edition of Monier-Williams
It is not Rinsen (Kyoto) but Meicho Fukyukai Co., Ltd. (Tokyo 1986).  I
have a copy, but it does not have address, nor price on it (I don't recall
it).  Maybe someone else knows.  The company has also published reprints of
other standard works for Skt and Buddhist studies such as Bohtlingk-Roth,
etc.
