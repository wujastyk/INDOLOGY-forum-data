Scary news from India
After living in Bombay during the riots of '92-'93, I am not pleased 
about the elections either.  I have my own ancedotes of that time that 
are not for this group.  I must take issue on the tone of this post. 
Titling it "scary news" does not help India.  The emotional wording 
provoke typical Western reactions about India.  Certainly there are 
consequences to be considered but indologists represent India to the rest 
of the world and, like it or not, are ambassadors or diplomats of a 
sort.  It would be prudent to take this responsibility with wisdom.
