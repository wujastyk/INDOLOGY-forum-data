Q: URL addresses
Dear Dr. Hueckstedt and other members of the Indology list:
The URLS you have posted below for ASNIC and SAGAR are both correct and 
are both working.  I just checked both addresses, and they seem fine.  
As I am not sure what the trouble is, I have forwarded this 
message on to <kamal at asnic.utexas.edu>, the Asian Studies Internet 
Coordinator at UT.
Has anyone else had similar problems?
