Ganesan
How are you? It is some time since we were in email contact. I have been
fantastically busy in Lancaster with double the number of students and
trying to finish my book on the Dance of Siva based on Umapati
Sivacarya's Kuncitanghristava. So much so that I missed seeing
Vidyavacaspati Dr. R. Nagaswamy when he was in the UK; I have just
discovered a letter from him to me in September 94 (!) telling me of a
paper he had in press dealing with the date of Umapati. I will write to
him in India, asking for a copy of this paper, but I email you now in
case he is with you at present and at sufficient leisure on his very
busy trip to just pass on via you in brief the new details of Umapati's date. My
book is just now being typeset. Please do not trouble him if he or you
are too busy.
With all good wishes
Yours sincerely
David Smith
