Landsat, Geology and Sara...
Thiru S. Kalyanaraman,
     I AM willing to help track down Landsat maps.  By the same token, I'm
hoping you do intend to answer my specific objections (and Dominik's?) to the
proposed hyphenation of Indus Valley Civilization with Sarasvati.  Again, can
you tell me which if any Harappan site along the presumed former route of the
Sarasvati was substantial enough to be ranked on a par with Mohenjo-Daro,
Lothal and Harappa.  Could any be considered towns, at least?
