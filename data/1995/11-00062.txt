Subject: SOFTWARE KEYBORD FOR DEVANAGARI
Message-ID: <161227021616.23782.9507041040512830262.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

The best Windows-based Devanagari font set/wordprocessor I've ever used is
from Gamma Productions, 12625 High Bluff Dr., #218, San Diego, CA, 92130
USA. Telephone No.: 800-974-2662 The latest 32-bit version runs very fast
under Windows95. I teach Sanskrit and have used Devanagari computer-based
wordprocessors for almost 20 years. However, this is not shareware. Please
e-mail me if you have further questions.
