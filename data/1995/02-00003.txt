David Magier recently gave some very useful and important tips on reference
searching, including information on CARL UNCOVER.  In that context he
mentioned the possibility of ordering  "full-text copy of many articles by
entering a credit card number ..."  It is perhaps not altogether
unnecessary to mention here, for the benefit of everyone, that it is
EXTREMELY UNWISE to enter confidential data such as one's credit card
number on any form of electronic system, such as the internet.   There is
no way to control access to this information, and the possible  results are
not happy to contemplate.  We should all beware.
