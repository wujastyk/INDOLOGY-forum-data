Many thanks are due to Kenyon Chan and Shirley Hune for sharing with 
the net their core bibliography "Teaching Asian American Studies."  
Since, however, this bibliography includes only one item specifically 
devoted to South Asian American issues but includes several which, 
though they go under general Asian American titles, exclude or omit 
the South Asian American experience, I hope that I may be permitted 
to announce the following forthcoming publication which may be of 
complementary value.  "South Asian American Studies: A Working 
Bibliography 1975-1994" will appear in the next issue of _Sagar: 
South Asia Graduate Research Journal_ (2:1, Spring 1995).  _Sagar_ 
is available both in hard copy and electronic versions.  Write
sagrj at uts.cc.utexas.edu.  
Although this bibliography is being published at the request of South 
Asianists who wish to be more informed on South Asian American issues, 
I hope that it may be of equal interest to Asian Americanists who wish 
to include more materials on the South Asian American experience in  
their readings.  I would also be grateful to members of the net who 
may communicate to me titles recently published that may not yet have 
come to my attention and titles of items currently in the press.  
Since I have to turn in the bibliography before leaving for four 
months of research in India beginning on March 26, any communications 
would have to reach me by March 19 to be included.  
Many thanks and warm wishes to all!
