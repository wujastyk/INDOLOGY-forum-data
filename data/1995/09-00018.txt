Brahman belong. From what I have read, I have come to the assumption
that the branch identification may come from the Veda the family studies.
But is the identification taken from the school to which the family 
belongs, or from the author of the books the family traditionally
follows? 

In his "Hindu Castes and Tribes", Matthew A. Sherring, writes about 
a system whereby Brahmans are classified as follows:

     <name> is a Tri-, Panch-, or a Sat- prawa Brahman of the
     <a> branch of the <b> clan, of the <c> rank, of the <d>
     gotra, of the <e> division, of the <f> tribe of <g> 
     Brahmans.

        An example is:
        Vishnu Narayana is a Satprawa Brahman of the Apabmasta
        branch of the Brihadgram clan of the Upadhyay rank, of
        the Bharadvaj gotra, of the Chitpavam division, of the
        Maratha tribe of Dravira Brahmans.

I have been able to find every variable except for the branch. Is 
there any text, perhaps a Purana, which provides lists of the
schools, or branches, of the Vedas?

Thank you.
