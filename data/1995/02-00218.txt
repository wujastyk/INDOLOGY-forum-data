once more about CSX
Jakub Cejka said:
No, you're absolutely right. There are e/o+tilde, breve, and grave and
acute are in IBM 437 (I now have strong reservations about using this as
a "bacground" to CSX; another topic for discussion).  But no e,o+macron.
Dravidologists: are e- and o-macron needed for Tamil?
CSX is *really* meant only for Sanskrit (hence "Computer Sanskrit
eXtended"), but the thinking was that if the addition of one or two
extra letters could add a whole other S. Asian language then great.  But
it may not be possible to take this very far, since there are fewer and
fewer characters that can be displaced easily.
Madhav: could you answer about Manjushree etc?  Thanks.
