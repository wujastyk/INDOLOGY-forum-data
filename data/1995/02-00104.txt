Thanks to Sree. S.Kalyanaraman for such an elaborate and quick reply.
So, this word appears as a pure dravidian word. But, the fact that
that even in Hindi and Marathi 'kundan' is associated with 'jewelry' 
or gold  led me to assume a sanskrit derivation. Any clarifications 
as to how this word got into Hindi and Marathi ? Thanks, Suresh.
