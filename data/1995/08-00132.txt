Critique of India
L. S. Cousins writes:
Point taken. Actually, the definition of Europe is a bit of a problem,
since it has changed with the centuries. Europe stretching from the
Atlantic to the Urals is a quite modern concept. What I had in mind was the
"core" of Europe, that is those parts that have been considered part of the
continent for many centuries, that is again the Northern shores of the
Mediterranean and the parts stretching towards the North Sea in the North
and the Catholic or Protestant countries in Central Europe (also a somewhat
fuzzy term). That Eastern Europe belongs to "Europe" is a pretty modern
concept, in fact a British historian visiting Oslo some time ago told about
an unpleasant encounter in the British Foreigh Office where an official
told him that "we do not consider Bosnia part of Europe". But LSC is right:
We must compare regions of India with regions of Europe.
Whether the Turks ruled half of Europe is a matter of how you define
Europe. The Mongols never ruled Europe, although they devastated large
parts of Hungary, Poland and ajoining regions. Europe (no matter how you
define it) was saved by the bell: The great Khan died, and his sons had to
return to Karakorum to decide who was to succeed him. They never came back.
Definitely, and it might have brought the European states down. Few kings
understood the significance of the Mongols, and only the king of France
tried to create an alliance against them. Without success.
I think E. M.Jones (see former bibliographic reference) would disagree to
this. Europe was, according to him, marginally better off for a number of
reasons (among these: fewer natural catastrophes). I have not got the time
to repeat his argument, but read the book. It is quite interesting and
thought-provoking.
