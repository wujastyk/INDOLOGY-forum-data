The Padma PuraaNa is indeed extant in two recensions, Bengali (in 5
khaNDas) and Western (in 6 khaNDas). To my knowledge, all published
versions are based on the Western recension, although the Bengali
recension looks like the more original one.

As for the UttarakhaNDa, the Bengali recension is considerably shorter
and generally different than the Western recension, the latter bearing
the marks of numerous especially VaiSNava additions.
