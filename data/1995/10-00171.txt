Why go through the keyboard or phonetic interfaces?

I designed and a new york publisher has brought out a CD-ROM with 1500+
fonts for all South asian language scripts incuding Sanskrit. The design
features are:

ANSI character set for all the glyphs required.

Windows (e.g. MS Word 6.0 has a feature Insert, Symbol) brings up the
chart on the document screen. User can point and click on the desired glyph,
as in hand-writing. The clicked glyph zooms and pops out and enters the 
document. There is built-in intelligence to align the diacritical glyphs
at correct locations of the preceding principal glyph.

This provides the foundation for the next key design feature: portability,
the fonts are usable ON ALL APPLICATIONS CURRENTLY USED FOR ENGLISH, e.g.
dbase, spreadsheed, graphics, internet etc. This was presented in an
international conference on applicationof information technology for south
asian languages of the computer society of india; I was the keynote speaker.

Ease of use is so pronounced with direct graphical user interface that even
an ASCII based ISCII standard phonetic keyboard is eliminated.
