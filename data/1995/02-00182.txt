An alternative history of IE languages and the AIT.

We are going to go on getting this sort of material periodically posted
to INDOLOGY for the simple reason that the ideas are out there, being
energetically promoted by Hindu fundamentalists and others who may not
realize the sinister communalist and anti-muslim agenda that underlies
and accompanies such propaganda.
Do any of the INDOLOGY members who are professional university-level
teachers of Sanskrit, Old Persian, Greek, Tamil, archaeology, or other
relevant topics, have time to put together a short, careful response to
such claims, pointing out the principle evidence for the received
opinion concerning Indian pre-history?  Or perhaps someone already has a
document of this kind on their PC?  Perhaps someone has written some
book reviews of the above books or the materials by Frawley, Kak, or
similar contemporary writers?  I feel sure that someone amongst us who
deals professionally with PIE, historical phonology, early archaeology,
etc., has the appropriate materials readily to hand.  The resulting
statement could be added to the files available from the INDOLOGY
file-server, or could be sent on an individual basis to enquirers.
This would be a singular service to INDOLOGY.
