I should appreciate it if someone could give me the proper citation for 
the following title of which I am uncertain:

Sri Kedaranath Mahapatra, _Descriptive Catalogue of Sanskrit Manuscripts 
	in the Collection of the Orissa State Museum_, Vol. II: Kavya 
	(?), 1960 (?).

[I need the ref. to the descriptive catalogue of Kaavya MSS]

Many thanks,

K.G. Zysk
