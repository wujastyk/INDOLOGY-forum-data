MSS in Orissa
I should appreciate it if someone could give me the proper citation for 
the following title of which I am uncertain:
Sri Kedaranath Mahapatra, _Descriptive Catalogue of Sanskrit Manuscripts 
	in the Collection of the Orissa State Museum_, Vol. II: Kavya 
	(?), 1960 (?).
[I need the ref. to the descriptive catalogue of Kaavya MSS]
Many thanks,
K.G. Zysk
