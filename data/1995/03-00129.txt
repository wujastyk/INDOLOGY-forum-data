Sanskrit *apud* Classics again...and Hindi??
At the Jagiellonian University in Cracow, Poland, we have Indian 
Department in the Institute of Oriental Philology where both Sanskrit 
and Hindi are taught. For 3 years our students are learning both 
Sanskrit and Hindi language and literature and then they choose 
subjects related to one of them. The only link we have with 
our Classic Department is an obligatory 2 years course in Latin.
