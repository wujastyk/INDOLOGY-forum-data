PataJjali a form of ZeSa
Here is a couple of (perhaps too obvious?) references:
viSamaviSadharo 'nekavaktraH subhogii ... bhujagaparikaraH ...
devo 'hiizaH
(VyaasabhaaSya's (VII/IX c.) invocatory zloka, not found in all MSS,
ignored by Vaacaspatimizra but known to VijJaanabhikSu, hence rejected by
some as an interpolation)
phaNibhartur ... phaNibhRtaaM bhartraa
(BhojavRtti's (XI c.) intr. zloka 4-5)
Moreover, in LiGgapuraaNa (VII/IX c. ?) I,63,33 ff. ZeSa is mentioned as
the first of the 26 sarpa anuttama originally begotten by Kazyapa on
Kadruu, while PataJjali is the last. Other puraaNas differ: e.g. ViSNu
only has 12, whereas Vaayu names 40; PataJjali occurs in neither.
As for YS II,47, there indeed is a varia lectio ananta/aanantya; among
the commentators reading ananta, Vaacaspatimizra, VijJaanabhikzu,
Raghavaananda Sarasvatii, BhaavaagaNeza, NaagojiibhaTTa, Raamaananda and
Sadaazivendra Sarasvatii refer this to ZeSa, but they are all later than
KaiyaTa.
