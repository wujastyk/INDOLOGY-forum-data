there is no need to suppose that the British, or the Arabs, or the Aryans deserved - in any 
way at all - to spread their language and mannerisms worldwide, at different periods. That's 
just the way it happened (so far). Nor is there any need to suppose that the victims of those 
expansions were uniformly nicer or wiser people than the victors. Nor is there any need to 
suppose that `the victors' were themselves united: at the time of the British Raj most Britons 
were at least as much victims as most Indians. I am willing to accept my share of the 
communal guilt - and some credit - for British behaviour in India and elsewhere (as being a 
willing subject of the United Kingdom, united by ties of civil friendship, and consequently 
ready to be ashamed of things done in that kingdom's name), but I can also point out that my 
actual ancestors were themselves oppressed members of the labouring classes, and had no 
say at all in what was done in India or elsewhere. Those who criticise `the West' often seem 
to have a very odd idea of what people `in the west' are like. No doubt those who criticise 
`India' seem equally naive.
