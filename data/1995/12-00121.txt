A pointer to this , guys I suggest you start reading Kolhon's 
Rajtaringini about the history of Kashmir and then other modern writers 
to find out the plunders the brahminists did over budhhist and jain 
relics and supporters .. The famous jagannath temple is built on a 
buddhist shrine (ARchelogical files of Orissa . Govt of Orsss -Dept of 
Archelogy NAtional .library Calcutta)
