Question regarding the Surya and Chandra Vamsas.
Members,
I am looking for information regarding the two vamsas, particularly any 
histories, myths, and lists which concern themselves with the origin of 
the vamsas. The libraries here do not have any volumes on the subject, 
let alone much on the topic of Indian ethnology, and I therefore will 
appreciate any information about the Surya and Chandra vamsas.
Thank you in advance.
