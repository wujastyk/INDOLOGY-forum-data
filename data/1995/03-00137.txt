  D.: From where did ignorance come?
  M.: There is no such thing as ignorance. It never arises.
Everyone is Knowledge itself. Only Knowledge does not shine
easily. The dispelling of ignorance is Wisdom which always
exists - e.g., the necklace remaining round the neck though
supposed to have been lost; or each of the ten fools failing to
count himself and counting only the others. To whom is
knowledge or ignorance?
  D.: Can we not proceed from external to internal?
  M.: Is there any difference like that? Do you feel the
difference - external and internal - in your sleep? This
difference is only with reference to the body and arises with
body-consciousness ('I'-thought). The so-called waking state is
itself an illusion.
  Turn your vision inward and then the whole world will be full
of Supreme Spirit. The world is said to be illusion. Illusion
is really Truth. Even the material sciences trace the origin of
the universe to some one primordial matter - subtle,
exceedingly subtle.
  God is the same both to those who say the world is real and
to their opponents. Their outlook is different. You need not
entangle yourself in such disputations. The goal is one and the
same for all. Look to it.
