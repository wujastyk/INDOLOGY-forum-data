Kuppuswami Inst.
I take the liberty of reproducing and forwarding to the List the main 
points of the letter I have recently received from the Kuppuswami 
Shastri Institute, Madras. I am sure that the present difficult situation
of this prestigious research Institute will not fail to arouse* the active
interest of the colleagues.

    Dear Prof. Torella,
  I take the privilege of sharing with you some latest developments 
at the Kuppuswami Shastri Research Institute, Madras, as you are one
of the friends for many years. Of course, you are aware of the general 
trends in the history of the Institute, which could be also be seen at 
a glance from the enclosure. (...)
    The Institute had to become again independent of the Govt. support
from April 95 due to unforeseen circumstances.
    Our emergent need is to collect within a year or two at least Rs.30 lakhs 
towards corpus/endowment fund and to meet the annual expenditure on the establishment and academic work.
    In this connection, we are appealing to scholar-friends like yourself, 
well-wishers of the Institute, and benevolent patrons of Sanskritic and 
Indological studies.
    I therefore request you, on behalf of the Institute, to contribute 
considerably, in one, two or more easy instalments.  The draft is to be drawn
in the name of the Kuppuswami Shastri Research Institute, Madras. 
An official receipt will be duly sent to you.
    I hope to hear from you positively and I sincerely thank you 
in anticipation,
																																											Yours sincerely,
																																									      	S.S. Janaki
