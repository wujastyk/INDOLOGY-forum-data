VOI message
It seems that Indology is not so a-political after all.  Of the various 
internet 
venues, indology has been singled out by Voice of India as "cacaphony" 
free for the dissemination of such a book.  
I believe that VOI should understand that just because we study 
pre-modern India does not mean that we should be receptive to what I think
can hardly be considered an a-political message.  Of course I am 
assuming, perahps naively, that everyone would agree on this point.
I suggest that we, if there is some consensus, should respond to Voice 
of India that this venue is not for politics.  If we fail to do so, 
then, well, we must admit that a very hot political topic has been 
dropped in our midst, and then, I'm afraid, we will be forced to talk 
about it.  Communalism and the writing on pre-modern India might actually 
be a very interesting topic.  If we don't want to take it up, and stick 
to our stated "apolitical agenda," then, I think a response to VOI is 
in order.
