Research institutes in India
The American Institute of Indian Studies has been doing just the sort 
of things you contemplate for somewhat more than 30 years.  I'd be happy 
to share whatever counsel I can either by e-mail or in person (if one of 
my India trips coincides with one of yours).  Regards, Rick Asher, 
President AIIS.
