Identity of the plant tagara
The Sanskrit plant name "tagara" is identified by some as Indian
Rose-Bay (Tabernaemontana coronaria, Br.) but perhaps more frequently by
others as Indian Valerian (Valeriana wallichii, DC.).  Cf. Nadkarni
entries #2425 and #2558.
Tagara is recommended by Su"sruta as part of a remedy for skin eruptions
due to external poisoning (Su.ka.1.53).  Use of T. coronaria is noted in
skin disease;  Valerian is normally taken internally, to calm the
nerves, although Gerard reports that Dioscorides recommends it against
poison.  But again, taken internally.
One commentator on Caraka, Yogindranath Sen, says tagara is the same as
aguru, or Aloe wood (Aquilaria agallocha, Roxb.; Nadkarni #208), but I
think this can be ruled out.  PV Sharma, in his tr. of Caraka, vol.4,
p.704 says tagara is Delphinium brunonianum, Royle., but since this is
considered  poisonous this seems "inconceivable!!" (ref. "The Princess
Bride").
Dhanvantarinighantu identifies tagara with madana, or Emetic Nut (Randia
dumetorium, Lamk.), which has the right uses, being applied as a paste
to disperse abscesses.  But I can see no other reason to recommend this
identification.
Does anyone have privileged information about the identity of tagara?
