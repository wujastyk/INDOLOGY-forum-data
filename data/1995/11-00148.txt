Hello Indology subscribers, hello Leonard,
You wrote about "Sanskrit grammars":
Have a look into Pieter C. Verhagen: A history of Sanskrit grammatical  
literature in Tibet. Vol. 1. Leiden 1994, p. 202.
Verhagen points to Bu ston who mentioned Rajasri as an author of a  
grammatical treatise. Verhagen guesses that he - scil. Rajasri - may be  
identical with the author of the Manjusrivyakarana, a grammatical work to  
be found in the Tanjur (op.cit., p. 199 seq.).
He does not mention a Vyakaranalamkara in his index, neither did Aufrecht  
in his Catalogus Catalogorum (the New Catalogus Catalogorum has reached  
"P" so far I know).
A voluminous compendium on the history of vyakaranasastra is Yudhisthir  
Mimamsak's Vyakaran sastra ka itihas (or is it Samskrt vyakaran sastra ka  
itihas ? -- I have it not at hand). Besides fanciful datings for the older  
grammarians this work contains useful data for the later ones. Perhaps  
this may of some help for you. But I fear a comprehensive history of the  
later non-Paninian grammarians has still to be written.
