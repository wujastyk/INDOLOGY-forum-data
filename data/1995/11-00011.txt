Geldner's RV in English?-- no!
I do not think it is a good idea to get Geldner translated into English. As
far as I know, Stanley Insler has long been preparing a complete new
English translation of the Rgveda. He is the man to do this translation.
Stanley's problem, if I have understood him correctly, is to find time from
other duties to complete this very important undertaking.
