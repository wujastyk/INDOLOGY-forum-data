Critique of the West in Indic literature and society
Thank you for your answer to my inquiry. It is an interesting text which I
didn't know, and it seems quite "genuine". This is the sort of stuff a
Brahmin ascetic might actually have said (although certain Greek
philosophers like Diogenes (of the famous barrel) would certainly chime
in). I'll pass it on to my colleague!
Best regards,
