Michael Rabe; thanks a lot for your offer on the Landsat map photos.  I
deeply appreciate your kindness and help.

Kalibangan, Banawali, Dholavira, Rangpur, Lothal, Rupar, Bhagwanpura are on
the valley of the Landsat tract of the lost river and very close to the
Rann/Cambay complex (regions: Panjab -- now divided Haryana and Panjab,
Rajasthan and Gujarat). They do not rank in urban grandeur with Harappa and
Mohenjo-daro (Sind and Panjab regions) but many have yielded vivid
seals/sealings and other Harappan artefacts.

Isn't it notable that the landsat yields the picture of a river that varied
between 2 to 10 miles in width over a long stretch, apart from the geological
signatures of Indus found in the Cutch Rann/Cambay gulf.

Kalyanaraman
