"The enemy of the lotus"
Has anyone come across a synonym for the sun (suurya, arka) which means
"enemy or killer of the lotus", i.e., kumudhaghnii, kumudahan, etc.?
This would be antithetical to the names for moonlight such as
"kumuda-bandhu, k-suh.rt, kaumudii" etc.
Also, does the lotus, kumuda, *really* blossom in the moonlight, as is
implied by the common term "kaumudii"?
