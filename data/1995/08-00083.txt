THE UNIQUE POSITION OF THE SPANDA SCHOOL AMONG THE OTHERS OF THE TRIKA 
                          SYSTEM OF KASHMIR

Abstract: 
The first part of this paper explains the concept of spanda, 
the motionless vibration of our consciousness, according to the Trika 
schools of medieval Kashmir. The second part shows how this concept was
fully developed in the homonymous school, even though it was already 
present in the others, and gives a historical survey of the Spanda school.
The concluding third part summarizes why the Spanda school, even 
though it was traditionally never considered as a school, can be included 
among the others with its own place and features.
