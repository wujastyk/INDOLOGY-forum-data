To multiple recipients of Indology list,

 Recently I posted a query concerning Heesterman's 'axial-breakthrough' 
on Indology to which I got a number of very useful replies. One of these 
was posted on the list by M. Witzel, and detailed a number of articles 
he has written of considerable relevence to my thesis. This reply 
prompted a number of questions in my mind, but unfortunately I have not 
been able to reach M. Witzel since then. Given this situation I was 
wondering if anyone might be able to help me with regards the following 
questions. M. Witzel provided the following reference -

M. Witzel, The Realm of the Kurus: Origins and Development of the First 
State in India. The Realm of the Kurus, Nihon Minami Ajia Gakkai Zenkoku 
Taikai, Hokoku Yoshi, [Summary  of the Congress of the Japanese 
Association for South Asian Studies], Kyoto 1989, pp. 1-4 

 I requested the university library to interloan this for me, but they 
can find no record of this article - is this essay unpublished? or is 
the reference incomplete/incorrect?

Further, does anyone on the list have any idea as to when the other two 
references cited by M. Witzel will be available?

Early Sanskritization: Origins of the first Indian State.
Proceedings of the Munich Conference on Indian History 1992, ed. B. 
Kolver 
(pp. 20, forthcoming)

or, in great detail:
The Realm of the Kurus, Sachsiche Akademie der Wissenschaften, Leipzig, 
(forthcoming) pp 160 

                               Thank you very much in advance,
