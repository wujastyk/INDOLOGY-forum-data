Message-ID: <161227018824.23782.4063623353017574309.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

     First she(Apurba Kundu e-mail: a.kundu at bradford.ac.uk)said on
soc.culture.indian.telugu:
For academic purposes, I'm looking for any and all WWW sites dealing with
South Asia (i.e., India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan and
the Maldives). They can be on any subject, e.g. politics, current events,
culture, films, songs, pictures, food, etc.
     Sofar, I,ve come up with:
http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~gupta/research.html
http://www-bprc.mps.oho-state.edu/cgi-bin/hpp?gifjpg.html
http://www.csbuffalo.edu/~skumar/india.html
http://india.bgsu.edu/index.html
http://spiderman.bu.edu/misc/india/
http://coombs.anu.edu.au/WWWVL-AsianStudies.html
http://saif.cc.oberlin.edu/Bangladesh/media.html
     Then he(Somak Raychaudhury e-mail: sr1 at mail.ast.cam.ac.uk) said on
soc.culture.indian.bengali:
The only www sites in India I know of are:
IUCAA Pune:
http://iucaa.iucaa.ernet.in/welcome.html
TIFR Bombay:
http://tifrc3.tifr.res.in:80808/tifr/
IIT Bombay:
http://nandadevi.cse.iitdernet.in/
IIT Delhi:
http://kriti.iitd.ernet.in/menu/iitd-home.html
The TIFR node seems to be putting up some very useful home pages. For
instance, there will be a homepage for the city of Bombay (including railway
information) soon.
http:/theory.tifr.res.in/misc/misc_city_services.html
Look for a list of Indian e-mail nodes in:
http:/theory.tifr.res.in/misc/indian_email_nodes
Also reachable are numerous sites on Gopher, e.g.,
I.ISc.:gopher://ece.iisc.ernet.in:70/1
The Maharashtra Tourism Development pages:
gopher://shakti.ncst.ernet.in/11s/mtdc
In addition, Srinivas Padmanabhuni at U Alberta has done us a great service
by compiling a very useful list:

     Then I (Sid Harth e-mail: bakula at delphi.com) said on
Indology at liverpool.ac.uk:
