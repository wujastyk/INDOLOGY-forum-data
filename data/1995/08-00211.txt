I'm also curious about this.  I thought CSX encoding used sh for the first
and shh for the second.  The only table I've seen for 7-bit ICSS encoding
comes from itrans documentation by Avinash Chopde.

As an aside, since when has it become standard to use "Z" for the first
"sha" (I forget its technical name) in  transliteration when diacritics are
not available? It is a most confusing convention.  Why not use "S" for
the first
"sha" and "sh" for the second? This is what I have always done, and it
has the advantage of not being visually jarring to the reader.
