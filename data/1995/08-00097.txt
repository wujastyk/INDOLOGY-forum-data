Critique of the West in Indic literature and society
Thanks for your comments, Dominik! As far as the robber baron theory is
concerned, those who believe in it should ask themselves the crucial
question: If an area the size of India is repetedly robbed blind by
outsiders, why is it unable to defend itself? India should always have had
the resources material and otherwise to repel invaders. Why did India fail
in doing so? Small and weak peoples that are robbed or oppressed by
powerful outsiders have an excuse. Others should take a critical look at
themselves.
I still miss references to a more systematic and sophisticated critique of
the West and its values.
Best regards,
