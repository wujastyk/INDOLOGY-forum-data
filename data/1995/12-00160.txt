Thanks to Allen Thrasher, Damien Keown and Dominik Wujastyk for their kind
offers to host the BJ Tripitaka. I have communicated them to IBRIC and
either they or I will get back to each of you in due course.

I am not sure whether IBRIC will, understandably, wish to do more
error-correcting before posting this. I will try to persuade them to post a
preliminary version as soon as possible, however, as I think that even this
will be extremely useful.
