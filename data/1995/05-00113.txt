reference to Hindu Gods
Hello,
I was given information that everyday of the week is linked to a particular Hindu God. Does anyone have more information regarding this reference? Does any such reference exist?
I would really appreciate it if someone could point me to sources for such information.
Thanks in advance,
-Suresh
