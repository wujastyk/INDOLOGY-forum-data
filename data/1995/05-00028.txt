     Before things get out of hand and Ms. E Hole gets upset by
                                           ^ ^^^^
misinterpretation of my mysterious four-letter word, let me spell it, at
least for the posterity.


     S*U*A*H is spelled as "Self-assured*Unrelenting*Aggressive*Hole-E's".
                                                                ^^^^^^
     The pun on the word "HOLY".

     This may be taken as a proof of why we should all spell all our four-
letter words so that nobody misinterprets them and causes more harm.

Sid Harth  "They better speak French in England" or is it "They speak better
            French in England"? It means the same, watch your semantics.
