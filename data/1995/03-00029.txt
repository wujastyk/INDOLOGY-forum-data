Dear members
This is my first posting to this list. I am an isolated (?) student of Indian 
philosophy. I am studying Uddyotakara's nyaayavaarttika, and reading it 
according to CalcuttaSktSeriesText (nyaaya-darzana) mainly. However, I have 
known Thakur's edition (Mithila 1967, 1st adhyaaya only) presents very 
important variant. I think it is not always definitive nyaayavaarttika edition
,
 but is excellent one ,and we cannot edit a definitive text of nyaayavaarttika
 
without helping his edition. I heard the following volumes of this edition 
will be hardly publishied. So I want to see the Jaisalmil's manuscript of 
nyaayadarzana (including nyaayavaarttika), which Thakur's edition based on.
If someone have an information about this manuscript, or its photostat copy, 
please teach me.
