>From the Rigveda

O Lord, may we ever hear auspicious words with our ears.

Samaveda 446 (?)

Listen to the melodious music of the divine poet.
He plays upon the flute of love -
and the notes soar to heaven and reach the distant stars
and dance on the raging waves of the sea.
The earth, the sea, the sky, the stars are all woven together
by the soft strains of the divine music.
Its vibrations echo through the corridors of time
in the endless canopy of the sky.

Atharvaveda 12.1

Untrammeled in the midst of men, the Earth, adorned with heights and gentle
slopes and plains, bears plants and herbs of various healing powers. May she
spread wide for us and offer us joy!

Rigveda 10.71.4

Certain ones, though seeing, may not see Her,
and other ones, though hearing, may not hear Her.
But to some, the Word reveals herself quite freely,
like a fair-robed bride surrendering to her husband.

Shatapathabrahmana

The cosmic mind was said to be neither existent nor non-existent. Once created,
this mind desired to become manifest. The cosmic mind then created the word.
