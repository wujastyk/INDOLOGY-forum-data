Rudrabhata's Jagannathavijaya
Does anyone know of an edition of Rudrabhatta's Jagannathavijaya, written
under Vira Ballala II of the Hoysala dynasty (1173-1220)? I am interested
in a bibliographic reference and would also like to know where I can find a
copy of the text (or get it copied!!).
Best regards,
