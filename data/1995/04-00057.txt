Conventions of Indian calendars
The two main conventions are the purnimanta (months ending with the full 
moon) and the amanta (months ending in the new moon); the purnimanta reckoning is popularly followed in many Northern calendars (thus the dark half is first)
while the amanta reckoning is popular in the Deccan and the south.  Hope this
helps.  Mary McGee
