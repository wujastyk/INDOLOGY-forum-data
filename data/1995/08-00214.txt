Some months back I recall seeing an issue of the New Yorker which carried 
a detailed article on the ins and outs of the Siddha Yoga Dham or SYDA or 
such names that Baba Muktananda's beseiged order goes by. Does anyone  
know which  issue, month and date, it appeared in, and the title? I made 
a reference to it and need to  note it .
