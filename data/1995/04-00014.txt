Madhav,
  That's the nicest posting I've ever seen on indology!  Please thank
your daughter Madhushree for her art work.

  My daughter Elizabeth used to spent many hours at computer art, but
now she has grown up and gone off to college at UCSC to study biology.
In fact this spring she is even farther out of touch, studying in the
rain forest in Costa Rica.  Daughters grow up much too quickly!

Best wishes,
David
