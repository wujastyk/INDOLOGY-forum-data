used the word "Similarly" to try to restore the parallelism.
Yes, leaving AdinA untranslated is the most serious flaw, I think, here.  
But the moving I do think aids clarity and does reflect the author's 
emphasis, though of course establishing that would be a long story and we 
would have to look at a lot of the preceding text.
Surely it is not nonsensical.  I think my translation is rather precise.  
The term may be a technical term in that it is used by NaiyAyika-s often, 
but it is used in the sense of my translation.  Why should short-hand be 
preserved in a translation meant for students of philosophy?

I disagree.
This may be largely true, but there may be some relevance, too.  The 
general point is that a translator operates within expectations and 
conditions set by the audience, and sometimes these override at least a 
too strict understanding of grammatical desiderata.  Still, probably some 
basic grammatical constraints cannot be overriden.
