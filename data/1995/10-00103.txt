I would like several copies of the dictionary for my
students. It seems that the Korean edition is not as 
compact as the Japanese one (if the Korean publisher
is Minjoksa Publishing in Seoul), since the dimensions
given by Minjoksa are closer to the edition of Motilal
Banarsidass. What a wonderful idea to persuade the
publisher to reprint the Dictionary. Thank you.
