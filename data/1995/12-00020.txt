Dear Indology-netters,

I (a volunteer who tries to spread information about the Voice of India 
publishers) am given to  understand that there has been much talk about the 
books on contemporary Indian history by Koenraad Elst (all published by the 
Voice of India). While some have spoken strongly against them, some have 
defended them, and some have been abiguous about them, certain basic 
facts seems to have been lost.
	For instance, Yvette Rosser wrote in a recent message (much of 
which I have deleted, without, I hope plucking the rest out of context)
