New WWW page
Yesterday I uploaded a web page for our Asian Studies Centre. We are a 
small outfit and cannot be mentioned in the same breath with larger 
programs, departments and centres at other institutions, but I may have 
stumbled on some links that may be new and interesting for you. If you 
have a look and see something I have missed, please let me know. Our 
address is:
