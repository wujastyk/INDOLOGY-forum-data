Subject: Request: Info about font encoding schemes
Message-ID: <161227020681.23782.2577658124155737687.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

What are the various coding schemes for the Devanagari font and where
can I find more information about them? So far, in this list I have
seen people mention the CSX, ICCS etc. forms of encoding.
Thanks
