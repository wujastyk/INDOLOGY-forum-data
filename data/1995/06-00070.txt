sarvangi editions
As promised, I checked on Callewaert's "Sarvangi of the Dadupanthi 
Rajab." I was mistaken in my recollection that C. edited only 
the Dadu poems from R.'s compilation; in fact he edited only the poems 
written by Rajab himself! The apparatus contains much important 
matter concerning the Dadu text tradition as a whole; but the book is no 
substitute for the more recent "Sarvangi of Gopaldas," even apart from 
the fact that it is based on a rather different compilation to begin with.
