I am looking for some information in answer to the following  
questions. I would greatly appreciate any help that I can get.  
Please reply to me by private email at vidya at cco.caltech.edu

1. Are there translations of the mAdhavIya Sankaravijayam other  
than the one by Swami Tapasyananda of the RK Mission, Madras? How  
about editions of the Skt. original w/o translation?

2. What are the various editions of the AnandagirIya that are  
available? My current information indicates that there was a  
Calcutta edition, dating to ~1868, of which there is supposed to be  
a copy somewhere in the UK. Is this correct? There is also a 1970  
edition from the U. of Madras, edited by Dr. Veezhinathan and Dr.  
TMP Mahadevan. Is there an earlier Kumbhakonam edition of the  
AnandagirIya? (Dating to the 19th cent.?)

3. What editions are available of the vyAsAchalIya Sankaravijayam?

4. Has anybody published the two commentaries (diNDimA of dhanapati  
sUrI and advaitarAjyalakshmI of achyutarAya) to the mAdhavIya?  
Where would manuscripts be available, if they have not been  
published?

5. Beyond their names, is anything more known about the prAchIna or  
the br.had Sankaravijayams?

Regards,

S. Vidyasankar
