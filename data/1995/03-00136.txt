  D.: From where do these objects arise?
  M.: Just from where you rise. Know the subject first and then
question about the object.
  D.: It is only one aspect of the question.
  M.: The subject comprehends the object also. That one aspect
is an all-comprehensive aspect. See yourself first and then see
the objects. What is not in you cannot appear outside.
  D.: I am not satisfied.
  M.: Satisfaction can be only when you reach the source.
Otherwise restlessness exists.
  D.: Is the Supreme Being with or without attributes?
  M.: Know first if you are with or without attributes.
  D.: What is samadhi?
  M.: One's own true nature.
  D.: Why then is effort necessary to attain it?
  M.: Whose is the effort?  
  D.: Maharshi knows that I am ignorant.
  M.: Do you know that you are ignorant? Knowledge of ignorance
is no ignorance.
  All scriptures are only for the purpose of investigating if
there are two consciousnesses. Everyone's experience proves the
existence of only one consciousness. Can that one divide itself
into two? Is any division felt in the Self? Awaking from sleep
one finds oneself the same in the wakeful as well as in the
sleep states. That is the experience of each one. The
difference lies in seeking, in the outlook. Because you imagine
that you are the seer separate from the experience, this
difference arises. Experience shows that your being is the same
all through.
