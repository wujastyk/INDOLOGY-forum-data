Self publicity
In the context of the current discussion of Penguin books, I hesitate 
to mention this, but here goes.
Some of you might be interested to know that my book 'The Perfect 
Wife: The Orthodox Hindu Woman according to the Stridharmapaddhati of 
Tryambakayajvan, previously published by OUP (Delhi 1989) and now out 
of print, has just been re-issued as a Penguin Black Classic. To tell 
you the truth, I am delighted! It's the thought of all those 
potential readers...
