RE: COMPARATIVE POVERTY
          On artifacts of exchange rates,  my  personal favorite  was  some 
          news report on the difficulties in Ethiopia.  It said the average 
          income for a college professor for $100 a month but that he would 
          have  100 unemployed relatives dependent on  him.   Either buying 
          power is awesome or their metabolisms are incredibly efficient.
