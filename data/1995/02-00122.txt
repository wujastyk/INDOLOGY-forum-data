Is there in this list of roots anything which would explain the Tibetan
'khor ba, which literally means "to circle."  I have heard Tibetan
commentaries on this term in Buddhist Tibetan which make it seem as if it is
a word for "whirlpool."  Any basis in Indo-European linguistics for that?

>     The root is perhaps, sR. sarayatE = begins to flow (Rgveda); saarun =

>     perhaps uncivil, directness: 'your wife'! It is analogous to saying:
>     'my wife is in the family way' as a substitute for: 'my wife is
