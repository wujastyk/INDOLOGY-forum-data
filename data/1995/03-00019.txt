Sanskrit word for canal
Sometime ago someone wanted to know if a word for canal exists in Sanskrit.There is a word for canal and it is immortalised by Bana in a verse about his patron King Harsha. It goes like this:
       Anganawedi vasudhaa kulyaa jaladhih sthalee cha paataalam
       Walmeekashcha sumeroo kritapratidnyasya Harshasya
 Roughly translated the meaning is
      For a determined King Harsha the world is like the frontyard,the ocean is like a canal the netherworld like basement Mount Meru like an anthill.
