I'm torn about this.  I can see the obvious sense in what you propose.
I don't like the idea of extra work, but it might be automatable.
However, I was once a member of a group that got exactly such a posting
on the 1st of every month, and after a while it DROVE ME BARMY.  Even
just deleting it.
So I take your point entirely, but maybe we could do something else,
like have a very brief information-line in the email headers (like where
it says "X-Comment: Indology mailing list")?  I've asked Chris Wooff if
this is possible/easy/a good idea.
