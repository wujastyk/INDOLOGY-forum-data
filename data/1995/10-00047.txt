Divali
I want to support Banerjee's fuller development of the meaning of
Divali.
It is important not to idealize any culture in such a way that we
suppose that all have the same experience or that only the elite
experience is meaningful.  As long a Brahmanical ceremonies include
serious caste restrictions we can't say this is how they are celebrated
unless we indicate the restrictions on who is allowed  celebrate them
and who is not.
