What to make of this?  I have heard that there is a separate
recension of the P.P. in Bengal.  Should I assume that
Ruupa is simply using a different MSS. line?  If the other
reading is more popular, why?  Is Ruupa's version a
special Vai.s.nava tradition?
P.S. even the first verse (smartavya.h....) is different in the
Bhakti-rasaam.rta-sindhu. The last pada reads "syur etayor
eva ki.mkaraa.h"
