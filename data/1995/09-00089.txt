Dear Peter,

according to G. Buehnemann (Puujaa. Vienna 1988, p. 30) the etymology of 
puujaa has not yet been explained convincingly. Mayrhofer (Kurzgefasstes 
etymologisches Woerterbuch des Altindischen. 4 vols. Heidelberg 1965-80) 
suggest a derivation from Tamil puucu 'to smeare'. However, Thieme (Kleine 
Schriften, p. 792) connects the word with *pRn^ca kR 'to prepare a mixture 
for someone'. As far as I know there there is no final conclusion regarding 
its etymology. Buehnemann gives a fair account of the various positions.

Best greetings and wishes, Axel
