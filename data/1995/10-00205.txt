...I would just like to remind people, when replying to junk-mail, NOT to
blindly hit the reply-button without verifying the "reply-to" line in the
header. What I personally hate even more than junk-mail are replies to it
which a) go to the mailing-list instead of to the sender and b) quote the
entire junk-mail yet another time. Thanks, but no thanks. 

End of distraction,
