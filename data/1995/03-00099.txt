Ganesan,
Thank you for one more excellent article.
A question:  I am from Trichy, and actually, 
that suburb of Trichy is called "ThiruvAnaikkAval"
("Elephant Guard"), not "ThiruvAnaikkA" or 
"ThiruvAnaikkAdu" ("Elephant Forest").  Do
you know the reason for this discrepancy?
Best regards,
Narayan Sriranga Raja.
