Location of two texts
I'm not sure what the question is about. Are you looking for 
bibliographical data or for books.
As to the former, the kAzyapazilpa was published in 1926 as vol. 95 
of the Anandasrama Sanskrit Series. The aMzubhedAgama is not even
mentioned in the New Catalogus Catalogorum. Could it be a short title?
