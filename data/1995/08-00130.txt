Critique of the West in Indic literature and society

 I still miss references to a more systematic and sophisticated 
critique of the West and its values. 
 There are several pointed cross-cultural observations along the 
lines you seek in the myriad literature credited to Rajneesh. One 
that stands out in my mind as being quite original is paraphrased 
thus : The Western mind is concerned with the details of the patterns 
of the mind whereas the Eastern mind is just concerned with getting 
out of (transcending) it.
