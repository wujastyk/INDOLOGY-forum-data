Temple Destruction in Tamil Nadu [was Re: Temple Destruction in         South
I would take the list posted earlier with large doses of salt. It is historically documented fact that temples were broken down and mosques built in their
place. But then, to suggest that every masjid or mazar in highly Brahmin
dominated villages like Ambasamudram and Tiruchirapally was built on an
unidentified "temple site" is somewhat unbelievable. The list seems more like
an attempt at whipping up of religio-political passions in south India, which
has not had any sinificant history of Muslim rule.
