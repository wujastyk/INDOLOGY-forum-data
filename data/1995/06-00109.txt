The form that Kalyanaraman cites for Munda
	-kug (Munda) = rice
is incorrect: the proto-Munda form was *ru[ng]kug.  My authority is
a comparative Munda dictionary I am compiling with Patricia Donegan
and Norman Zide.  Neither the correct nor the incorrect form can be
related, even as a loan, to the Indo-Aryan or Dravidian forms that
he summarizes as kaNk.
