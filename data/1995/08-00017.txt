Embryo transler
 Can't help you with the reference, but just thought I'd mention, in
 case you were not aware of it, the Jain tradition about the transfer of
 Mahavira's embryo from a brahman woman to his (ksatriya) mother--see
 Dundas's "The Jains" and Jaini's "The Jaina Path of Purification" for
 Details.
