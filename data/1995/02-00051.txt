Kaamasuutra
Dear Jonathan:
We (Professor Tokunaga and his several students) are now reading
KAmasUtra in a class.
Last year I digitalized the text according to KAmasUtram with
commentary of yazodhara, dvitIyaM saMskaraNam, nirNayasAgarayantrAlaya, 
1900 and added chapter and verse numbers at head of lines according to 
KAmasUtram edited by ZrIdevduTTa ZAstrI, Chaukhambha Sanskrit Sansthan, 
Varanasi, saMvat 2049
Now proofreading has been done only till the verse 2.2.10. 
Are you interested in it?
