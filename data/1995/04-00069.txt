Friends and Colleagues,

on WWW. The announcement, taken from WWW, follows below. 

Subscription is free and open to all. However, articles, news etc. 
submitted to the journal are subject to review before publication.

                      ---------------------------------

This journal is open to all bona fide scholars in Vedic Studies. It is 
monitored for style and content by the Editor-in-Chief.
Our aim is to disseminate our work quickly.
There is copyright but with automatic permission to publish anywhere else 
later on when the author wishes to do so.
We include articles, abstracts, reviews, and news (such as on conferences, 
meetings, PhD projects of our students, etc.)
We may consider a column of answers to comments on articles published in 
the journal, with final comment by the author (like the format used in 
Current Anthropology).

The address is:
EJVS-list at husc.harvard.edu

To subscribe, send a message to:
LISTPROC at HUSC.harvard.edu
With this content :
subscribe ejvs-list your-name
e.g.: subscribe ejvs-list Joseph Green

You will then receive a brief greeting and some more information.


The home page on WWW is found at: 

http://131.175.62.190/~ejvslist

So far it includes the home page description of the journal, a news page and 
links (underlined) for direct subscription.


More details and news on the first issue to be announced soon.
