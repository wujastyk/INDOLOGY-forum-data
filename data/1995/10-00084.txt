Etymology of kSatriya
DR.S.KALYANARAMAN said:
Yes.  I consider C. S. Lewis's _Studies in Words_ to be one of the
finest such books, for example.  For me, this is the linguistic
equivalent of Geertz's "thick description" in social anthropology.  It
would be marvellous to have such subtle and searching studies for
Sanskrit words and concepts.  Of course quite a lot has been done: I
think immediately of van Buitenen's fine studies of "citta", "ahankara"
and related words.
