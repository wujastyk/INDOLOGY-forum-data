>From time to time we get unsolicited email of this type being sent to
INDOLOGY (this is called "spamming").  This practice is detrimental to
the internet, impolite to you and me, and contravenes basic netiquette.
I recommend having nothing to do with any company that spams.  Only by
being seen to be a commercial failure will this type of junk advertizing
die out.
