indexes of periodicals
The following message from Raffaele Torella contains a very useful
suggestion.  It would require some effort from some INDOLOGY members for it
to work, but perhaps only those members who are involved with journals at an
editorial level would need to make this effort, and they might be glad of
the extra publicity for their publications.

indexes of periodicals
Dear Dominik,
as a new subscriber to INDOLOGY (and a new Internet user, as well) among the
things I would have liked to find on line there are:
a) a periodically updated list of the latest Indological publications
b) detailed indexes of the contents of the Indological journals
To my mind, the latter would be particularly useful and easy to prepare. For
my part, I might send the indexes of the Rivista degli Studi Orientali and
of East and West.  Other colleagues might do the same as regards the
Journals published by their own Universities etc.
If you deem it useful and feasible, you might propose this initiative to all
the participants in the INDOLOGY list. Who might do this better than the
list owner?
With best wishes,
Raffaele  Torella  <torella at rmcisadu.cisadu.uniroma1.it>
