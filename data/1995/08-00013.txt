Kumara Kasyapa
In a footnote to his translation of the Abhidharmakosa, Louis de la 
Vallee Poussin, citing Samghabhadra refers to a sutra in which the 
events surrounding the birth of Kumara Kasyapa are described and in 
which a motif of embryo transplant plays a significant role. 
Samghabhadra notes that the Sthaviras deny the possibility of such an 
occurrence. And, indeed, the Pali versions of the story of Kumara 
Kassapa found in the Jataka and Dhammapada commentaries lack the 
transplant motif. 
Given the resources available to me in Buffalo, I have been unable to 
track down the version of the Kumara Kasyapa story to which la Vallee 
Poussin/Samghabhadra refer which includes the transplant motif. Can 
any kind soul provide me with a reference and, if possible, Sanskrit 
text of the relevant passage? Thanks.
