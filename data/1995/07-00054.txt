Vedanta

The attention paid to Advaita Vedanta in Indology goes beyond the Romantic
obsession, I think. Philosophers of various colours have tried to find in
advaita, "the philosophy of India/the Brahmins/Hinduism", either to praise
it as the highest philosophia perennis, (like Paul Deussen) or to berate it
as a distorted mysticism that leads Hinduism astray. Christianity then comes
in as the rescuing religion, and as part of the white man's burden. The
utilitarians, the idealists, the romanticists have all found advaita vedanta,
or their understanding of it, to be quite useful in what they had to say
or think about India.
Wilhelm Halbfass's "India and Europe: An Essay in Understanding" and
Ronald Inden's "Imagining India" address this issue with their own perspectives.
Roughly, the historical fascination with advaita can probably be traced to
the French translation of Oupnekhat.
