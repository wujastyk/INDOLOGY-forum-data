wrong LCTL gopher path
Last week, I announced the Less Commonly Taught Languages Project gopher,
which presents all US and Canadian colleges and universities that teach
LCTLs. The path I gave to get to the gopher was wrong. I left off one
crucial step. The correct path is below. I apologize to all of you who have
tried and failed to make the connection. Please try us again. (Also
apologize for cluttering your e-mail boxes and for cross-posting this to as
many language lists as I know of.)
