RE Ms. Doniger's translations
Hello: I received a message from PIPELINE-usa to resend the message I had
submitted on Nov 24,95.  Here it is:
I am sure there are differences with respect to the applicability of "manushya
dharma" to gods.  Perhaps, some body else can clarify.
interpretation of Vedic mythology suggested here is a rather modern way of
thinking.
One aspect of Rudra is the personification of anger, hence "raudravatara".
Daksha(prajapati) also means ritual skill.  The symbolic meaning here is that
rituals performed without observing proper protocol could lead to disastrous
results.  Since Yaska says that "manushya dharma" does not apply to gods, when
human like relationships are described, they can only be symbolic.  I see
nothing "modern" about it.
"not necessarily Freudian", that is the whole point, freedom of speech not
withstanding.
usually can take quite a bit of criticism or irreverent language without
yes, if it were only that.  The academic criticisms would have been just like 
"the dog barking at the full moon". But now, misrepresentations such as those
of Ms. Doniger, in the hands of persons like Pat Robertson is propagated to
millions of believing people.  That is the cause of the hurt.
