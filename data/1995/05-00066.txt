IASTAM conference
 On 27.4.95 Darshan Shankar (Director FRLHT) wrote that
 Vaidya Ram Manohar (Senior Res. Fellow, FRLHT) is proposing to
 come to the IASTAM conference, London, 16-17.11.95.
 Does anybody have more information on the above mentioned 
 IASTAM conference (e.g. participants, venue, address of the
 organizing committee)?
 What does FRLHT stand for?
 Thank you,
