In a short paper on Indian Buddhism one of my students quoted the 
following words, which she identified as a 'Sanskrit Proverb' (apparently 
found in _Reader's Digest_):

	Look to this day
	For yesterday is but a dream
	And tomorrow is only a vision.
	But today, well lived
	Makes every yesterday a dream of happiness
	And every tomorrow a vision of hope.
	Look well, therefore, to this day.

Can anyone help me identify a source for this?  My queries have not 
always produced fruit, but when I saw how much help Bob Hueckstedt got 
with a similar problem recently, I felt emboldened.

Thanks in advance,
