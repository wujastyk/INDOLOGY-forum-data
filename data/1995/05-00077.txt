This is in response to Bruno Lo Turco's inquiry about the
Yogavaasi.s.tha.  I hope you find these references helpful;
my familiarity with the literature runs only through the
late 1980s.  You might look at T. G. Mainkar's _The
Vaasi.s.tharaamaaya.na: A Study_ (Delhi: Meharchand Lakshmandas,
1977), Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty's _Dreams, Illusions,
and Other Realities_ (Chicago: Univ. Chicago Press, 1984),
Chris Chapple's introduction to Swami Venkatesananda's
_The Concise Yoga Vaasi.s.tha_ (Albany: SUNY Press, 1984),
or my _The Self and Its States_ (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass,
1990), p. 86ff.
