Nisus Word Processor
During the discussions regarding critical editions several references 
were made to the Nisus software.  I am looking for someone who is 
familiar with this word processor and who can give me some information 
about its advantages in creating critical editions over, say, the more 
popular Word software.  Any information of this sort would be greatly 
appreciated.
Thank you in advance
