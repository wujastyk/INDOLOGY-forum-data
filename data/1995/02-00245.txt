Semantic clustering technique in South Asian dictiona
     Mr. Lance Cousins; I agree with you that where historical records are 
     available, definite reliance can be placed on 'dating' a morpheme. In 
     languages of South Asia (with a scanty recorded historical tradition 
     -- whatever leads exist almost verge on mythological), an alternative 
     could be the basic principle found in ALL writing systems (including 
     Chinese): 'imaging' the sounds. [Chinese is a direct representation of 
     the sound and its meaning; Egyptian hieroglyphics and other writing 
     systems represent the 'image' of a homonymous sound.] The problem of 
     'history of a spoken word' becomes extremely complex for many 
     languages which did without a distinctive script, e.g. Tulu and many 
     Austro-Asiatic tongues. In such cases, corroborative evidence of 
     archaeology may help? S. Kalyanaraman Madras Tel. 91-44-493-6288

The problem with this is that we know it is wrong for European languages
where we have much more historical data. So rather the opposite is the
case. If we cannot establish ancestry then we have little to rely on.
