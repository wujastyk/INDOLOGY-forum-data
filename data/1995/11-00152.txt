Confucianism  (at least in some of its phases) seems to be an atheistic

seem to be necessary in the definition of religion. Also, some currents of
Indian "orthodox" thought (such astika systems as saam_khya and miimaam_saa)
are often interpreted as atheistic.

Parsee religion not to mention natural religions are simply Hinduism. Of course, you have
also Christianity and Judaism exist in (South) India. "South Asia" is even
larger than this country.
