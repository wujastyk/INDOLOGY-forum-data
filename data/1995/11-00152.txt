I'd like to comment on some statements by dr. Narahari Rao.

For many, at least some kinds of Buddhism are in fact atheistic.
Confucianism  (at least in some of its phases) seems to be an atheistic
religion too. Of course, you may have your own concept of religion but one
should realise it may not be generally accepted. The notion of God doesn't
seem to be necessary in the definition of religion. Also, some currents of
Indian "orthodox" thought (such astika systems as saam_khya and miimaam_saa)
are often interpreted as atheistic.

	I don't think many researchers would say Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism,
Parsee religion not to mention natural religions are simply Hinduism. Of course, you have
also Christianity and Judaism exist in (South) India. "South Asia" is even
larger than this country.
