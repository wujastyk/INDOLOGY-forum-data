Replying to Indology messages (fwd)
Mani Varadarajan said:
This has always been possible.  Send the message "set indology mail ack"
to the address "listserv at liverpool.ac.uk".
To learn about how you can get the best from the listserv software that
INDOLOGY uses, send the message "help" to the same address.  Also, try
sending "help set" to get a list of all the settings one has control
over.
