To whom it may concern,
         I am interested to find out more about: 
"indology at liverpool.ac.uk," what it is, what it does, who can gain access 
to it, and how one gains access to it, for example from a computer 
terminal in the library of the University of Pennsylvania, where I am now.
        I was given your internet address by another scholar, whose 
address is "Jwoo at sas.upenn.edu." and he also is interested in using 
"indology."  Could you send the same reply to him?
        Any information you can give us in this regard will be highly 
appreciated. We are eager to get started!
        Thank you, 
                 Michael D. Rosse
