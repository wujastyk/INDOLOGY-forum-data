Though one is inclined to try to find non-redundancy in any 
apparently redundant construction, I have been unable to find 
anything to show in the few cases that `sarva' is anything other 
than redundant. Consider this sentence from Dharmakiirti's 
Pramaa.navaartika (Gnoli p. 5 line 9).

yaavaan ka'scit prati.sedha.h sa.h sarva.h anupalabdhe.h.
Any (form of) denial whatsoever arises from non-apprehension.
