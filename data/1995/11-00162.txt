atheism ...
	In the spirit of atheism, guru O'Flowery; and here in USA
on the eve of the biggest and best shopping season of the year,
I am reminded of the precept by the old sage Charvak:
"rinam kritva ghritam pivet
 javat jivet
 sukham jivet"
which essentially exhorted one to borrow to live the good life.
        Well, be good and well,
