          To the person who asked about Moplah script: 
           
          A  complete  table  of transliteration for  Moplah  in  a  system 
          approved the the American Library Association and  the Library of 
          Congress is found in this book: 
           
          ALA-LC romanization tables; transliteration schemes for non-Roman 
          scripts ...
