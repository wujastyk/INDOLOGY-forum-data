Sorry to bother you again:

Through our library service I have tried to get a copy of an article by van
Buitenen/J. Ensink: "Glossary of Sanskrit from Indonesia", which was
published in the journal Vak in 1961 (Poona). The library service is unable
to "verify" the journal (they can't find it here in Scandinavia), so: does
anybody have that particular journal in the library? Please let me know!

Best regards,

Lars Martin Fosse
