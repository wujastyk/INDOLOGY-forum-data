Re Ms. Doniger's translations

As far as I remember, the ancient Indians talked about three levels of
interpretation. (adhyatma, adhideva, don't remember the third one) Shankara
often interprets the Vedas in terms of nature mythology. In other words,
their ideas about interpretation were not as simpleminded as the impression
I seem to have given. What I suggested, however, is that their
interpretation was not *strictly* symbolic. In other words, they may have
allowed other interpretations than the symbolic one. I should also add that
there was a continuous development of ideas in ancient India, just as in
Europa. The myths related in the Vedic literature most probably had a
concrete interpretation when they were created, but posterity certainly
read more into the myths than a mere concrete chain of events.
A certain lack of sensitivity is germane to all critical thought. You can't
tear apart time-honored, but false, ideas and values and at the same time
remain sensitive to the feelings of the "true believers" who rely upon the
old ideas, whoever they are. I understand the reference to Women's Studies
etc. as a reference to the problem of Political Correctness. In my humble
opinion, PCness should be shunned by any serious academic. But of course,
then you may not get a job....
It could also be construed as a kind of symbolic suicide: "If I don't get
candy, I'll eat crayons till I die". Anybody with theories about immanent
death-wish would love this.
