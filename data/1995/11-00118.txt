I certainly agree that Rushdie's novels are not a pure product of the South
Asian tradition, but I find that elements in Midnight's Children that could
only have originated in South Asia. Rushdie does not have to be a South
Asian scholar to have knowledge of the South Asian tradition. As far as I
can see, Western criticism has not be sufficiently aware of this. But by
all means: Rushdie is alive and should be able to comment upon this.
Instead of speculating on his sources of inspiration, South Asian or other,
we should perhaps just ask him.
