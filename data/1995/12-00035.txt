slavery
JB Sharma wrote on 2. Dec., in reply to some comments of mine:
I don't want to be picky, but the Arthashastra of Kautilya devotes a 
whole section to the rights and duties of slaves. This can be found 
in Chapter 13 of Book 3. My translation (by R Shamasastri, 1951) 
says: "The ransom necessary for a slave to regain his freedom is 
equal to what he has been sold for. (...) An Aarya made captive in 
war shall for his freedom pay a certain amount proportional to the 
dangerous work done at the time of his capture, or half the amount." 
Romila Thapar refers to this in her "History of India", and also says 
of the Mauryan period: "Domestic slaves were a regular feature in 
prosperous households, where the slaves were of low caste status but 
not outcastes. Slave labour was also used in the mines and by the 
guilds." Of the Chola period in the south she writes: "Slavery was 
frequent, with men and women either selling themselves or being sold 
by a third party. Many such persons were sold to the temple (...) The 
use of slave labour for large-scale production was not known."
Anyway, what about the famous game of dice in the Mahabharata, where 
Yudhishthira cries: "If you win, I shall be your slave!"
Interesting question. Anyone know other sources about slavery?
