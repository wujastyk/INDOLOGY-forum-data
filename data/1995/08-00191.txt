Dear Mr. Bose, 

Thank you very much for such unsexpected interest in my work! For you and 
for the other persons who have asked me for the bibliography: 

"Lo StrIdharma nei dharmazAstra", in Annali della Facolta' di Lettere e 
Filosofia dell'Universita' degli Studi di Perugia, Volume XXV, nuova 
serie XI, 1987/1988, 1, Studi Classici.

"The StrIdharma in the DharmazAstra: the Difference Between the StrIdharma 
and Svadharma and the StrIsvabhAva", in Annali della facolta' di 
Lettere e Filosofia dell'Universita' degli Studi di Perugia, Volume 
XXVIII, 1990/1991, 1, Studi Classici.

"Riflessione sulla donna Indiana. Il nuovo ruolo delle donne tra 
tradizione nazionale e modelli di emancipazione occidentali", in Sinistra 
Europea, Roma, Maggio-Agosto 1989.   

"First Greek and Latin Documents on Sahagamana and Some Connected Problems",
forthcoming in 2 parts in the Indo-Iranian Journal (soon)
and in Women in Religion, ed. A. Sharma, E.J. Brill, 1995 (forthcoming) 


First Greek etc. is forthcoming. I have already corrected the proof though.
Either you are patient enough to wait, or I will send it to you (snail, 
the slowest mail!)
If also the other papers are not accessible, I will send them (sigh!) to 
you. 

Thank you again


Enrica Garzilli
