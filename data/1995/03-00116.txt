potin import into south India
Last year I came across a paper which discussed the import of lead potin
into South India during the Satavahana period based on an analysis of
isotpes, and tried to prove that the satavahana coins were made from potin
imported from N african mines. Unfortunately, I did not photocopy the
article at that time, and I have lot the reference.
Does any one out there recall reading this article, and if so, could some
one please give me the refernce ?
Thanks in Advance
