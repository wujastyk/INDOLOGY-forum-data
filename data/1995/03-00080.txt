Dominik,
	I have not personally seen the night-blooming lotuses, because 
the places where I was out at night in Pune just did not happen to have 
them.  However, I have seen the Nishigandha flowers.  There is also 
another flower called Raat-RaaNi which blooms at night.  I have this 
particular plant as a house-plant in our Ann Arbor home, and, yes, it 
indeed blooms at night.
