PATRA; PATRI
I too cannot recall the festival or deity, but a scholar at Michigan some 
years back had shot film of a group of middle class brahman women in 
Bombay conducting the festival.  The sense I had was that the 
"possession" might be related to hyperventilation.
Returning to Patri, the matter about a Greek reference to Tulunad was 
included in B. N. Saletore's book _Ancient Karnataka_ (sorry to be unsure 
about the title, I am away from my library.
