Pullouts from e-text of the Mahabhaaratha ?
A friend of mine wants to know if it is possible to obtain, from the
e-texts of the RaamaayaNa and the Mahabhaarathaa, `pullouts' of sections
that have philosophical/religious significance, such e.g. the bhagavadgiita, 
vishhNusahasranaama, shivasahasranaaMa, the stories of Nalaa & Damayantii,
the viduraniiti, yakshaprashna, etc. 
As I understand it, his question is, given an on-line copy of the e-text of the 
Mahabhaarathaa, would it be possible to find these sections w/o having to scan 
the entire text.
Responses by e-mail OR to the list, please.
Thanks
