Help with a word
Dear Indologist,
        Does anyone knows if the word channel (like irrigation channel,
german: Kanal) exist in Sanskrit. Some people has told me that channel is a
semitic word which mean Cane. In Pali I have seen the word "udaka" which is
translated as irrigator, or ingenieur (the person). 
I am interested in something that has the meaning: A fixed entity used to
carry water. I have examined the words "udabhaara" and "udakaadhaara."  The
first one mean water-carrier which is not fix (as a cloud), and the second
mean reservoir (the meaning of water transport is not there).  
Thanks in advance,
A.Villarroel
