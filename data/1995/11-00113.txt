Midnight's Children
I always had the impression that there are echoes of the *dastan* ("orally
recited prose promance", to quote Frances Pritchett) in _Midnight's
Children_.  There is the same weaving together of subplots in a main story
line, the intrusion of magic into everyday reality, and the use of richly
textured language that envelopes the reader in the story.
