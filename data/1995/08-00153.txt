Critique of India
Lars Fosse writes:
If you define Europe in terms of a supposed 'core', this is a bit circular
in the present context - effectively, the 'core' is the part that didn't
come under Muslim control in Ottoman times. In truth of course both the
concept of India and the concept of Europe as political entities are modern
inventions. The Roman Empire was Mediterranean based. Similarly the ancient
Indian empires (whatever their social organization) seem to have been
Ganges-Indus based with some extensions into the area of present-day
Afghanistan. Of course there are cultural continuities (and
discontinuities) in both cases.
