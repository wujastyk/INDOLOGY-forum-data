Ancient words of greetings
PAli texts (canonical) attest to the use of:
'bho', 'bhante' (gotama, bhagavA) 
as modes of address and 
'saddhiM sammodi' 
as a form of salutation.
I shall be grateful for elucidation 
on the etymology of these words and 
for similar words of greetings in 
ancient forms of south asian languages.
