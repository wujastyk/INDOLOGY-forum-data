Poverty in Sanskrit literature
An interesting body of material on the portrayal of poverty in Sanskrit 
are the sections in various Subhaa.sita anthologies with titles like 
daaridrya, daridra-nindaa, 
aapat, diina, etc.  See, for example, 'Saarngadharapaddhati, 401-412; 
Suuktimuktaavalii 127; Subhaa.sitaavalii 3157-3206; 
Subhaa.sitaratnako'sa 39; Saduktkarnaam.rta 2226-2250; and 
Subhaa.sitaratnabhaa.n.daagaara pp.65-68. They do seem to agree that 
poverty is not very romantic or healthful.
 There is also an interesting interchange between Kosambi and Ingalls in 
their edition/translation, respectively, of Subhaa.sitaratnako'sa on the 
poverty issue.
