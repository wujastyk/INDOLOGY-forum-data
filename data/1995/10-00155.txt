Subject: Meaning of Panini
Message-ID: <161227021318.23782.9242786290711977849.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>


Sorry to wander off-topic, but I was reading a work titled "The Early 
Aryans of India" by S. B. Roy in which he writes that Panini was a 
Pathan. Is there any information to validate this claim?

Thanks.
