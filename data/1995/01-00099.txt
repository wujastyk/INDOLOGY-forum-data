Environmental Concern in South Asia
Lance:
I recently met a guy named Ian Harris who works in Pali and 
"eco-Buddhism"; 
I'm not exactly sure what that implies, but I think he might be able to help 
you.  I don't have an address for him, but his affiliation is St. Martin's 
College, in England, I'm not sure exactly where (maybe Lancaster?).  
Maybe someone else has his address.
