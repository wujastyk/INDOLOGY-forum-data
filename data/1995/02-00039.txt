The monumental work is 2,500 pages in fine print. It  has 8,000 head 
semantic-clusters which encompass over 1 million  words. [Thus over 4000 
headword of Burrow and Emeneau's Dravidian  etyma coalesce into over 12,000 
headwords of Turner's Indo-Aryan etyma and hundreds of Santali/Mundari/Sora 
lexemes to generate a semantic super-set of Vaak or Sarasvati or Braahmi which 
may be appropriate appellations for the ancient South Asian lingua franca.]
The work was prepared on WordPerfect 5.1 and occupied 25MB of disk space. 
I do not know the publisher's price for the CD-ROM. This  work which marks a 
change of paradigm in South Asian language studies, will  be of interest to the 
indology group; for further details on the multi-media multi-language 
comparative dictionary of south asian languages, contact: Scanrom Publications,
