Manushi
Dear Professor Coburn,
   I met you when you came to Penn and gave your talk "Sita fights while 
Rama Swoons" (We both did our undergraduate at Princeton)-- I remember that 
you mentioned that you're a friend of Madhu Kishwar's.  I'm trying to get a 
subscription to Manushi, however, the address I wrote to in New York has 
neither responded to my letter nor cashed the check for the subscription 
which I sent them.  Do you have any clues about how to do this? maybe 
another address?
Thanks very much,
Loriliai Biernacki
