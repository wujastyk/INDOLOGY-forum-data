List: sci.astro.archaeo
Dear Mr. Wagers,
Congratulations for your new prosed list! 
[I have already tried in vain to write directly to you at 
wagers at computer.net. ALso the finger on you did not work]
I am very interested in it.
I have been studying and publishing on Trika (also known as Kashmir 
Shivaism) for over 15 years. That is a philosophical system of the 9th cent. 
onwards that systematized and used in a new fashion also cosmogonical and 
astrological theories of the time (borrowed from other systems and cultures such as 
Buddhism, Babylonian astronomy, etc.). 
I am also he Editor of the electronic International Journal of Tantric 
Studies and its mailing list.
As you might know, Tantrism deals in large part with your subject.
