pau.skara
I am interested in Dr. Ganesan's statement that the Pau.skaraagama 
contains passages that are Sanskrit redactions of the 
civa~naanabotam.  I have heard it said that the latter work is a 
Tamil redaction of the Rauravaagama; but this is entirely new to me.
Could you tell me which passages of the Pau.skara you were referring 
to, or where I might read up about this borrowing?  (Does any 
of the secondary literature you mentioned in your posting 
refer to it?)
Yours,
Dominic Goodall

away from home.)
