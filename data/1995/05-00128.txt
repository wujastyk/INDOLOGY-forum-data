Hindi-Urdu Appointment at NCSU/UNC-CH
DEAR INDOLOGY SUBSRIBERS:
The email I just sent was supposed to go to Tony Stewart, not to everyone.
I apologize most profusely to everyone concerned, especially to Dr. Stewart
and to Tehsin Siddiqi.
I am new to email use and it was a beginner's mistake.
Ruth Schmidt
