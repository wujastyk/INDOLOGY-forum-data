A big thank you to everyone who sent me their preferences for the date
of the next World Sanskrit Conference.  Your message were read out
before the planning committee, and formed the main plank for deciding
the date.  The overwhelming vote was for the first week in January, 1997
(sorry Harry).  Therefore, the date of the conference has been fixed as
3rd-9th January, 1997.  The venue is Bangalore.

This is not an official announcement, but is just meant to be an
indicator to help advance planning.  It is not impossible, though highly
unlikely, that the planning committee may change its mind.

Towards the end of April, the first official circular will go out with
introductory information.  A copy will also be posted on INDOLOGY.
