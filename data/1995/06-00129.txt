Traditional Asian Medicine in the Modern World
Wellcome Institute for the History of Medicine
16-17 November 1995
The International Association for the Study of Traditional Asian
Medicine (IASTAM) is pleased to announce its first Regional Symposium,
which will be held in London in collaboration with the Wellcome
Institute for the History of Medicine on 16-17 November 1995.  The
symposium will consider the topic of "Traditional Asian Medicine
in the Modern World", and will be convened by Dr. Lawrence I. Conrad,
President of IASTAM, at the Auditorium of the Wellcome Building,
183 Euston Road, London NW1 2BE.
The IASTAM regional symposia have been launched in light of the
fact that the Association's primary venue, the International Conference
for the Study of Traditional Asian Medicine (ICTAM), is convened
only about once every five years, and is held in an Asian country.
The regional symposia will rotate among other parts of the world,
and will hopefully serve the triple purpose of 1) ensuring the vitality
of the organization during the long gaps between the ICTAM meetings
in Asia, 2) providing venues for discussion to members who find
it difficult to attend the major meetings, and 3) enhance the exposure
of IASTAM and its members to researchers, practitioners, and professional
societies of relevance to IASTAM's interests worldwide.
In the first Regional Symposium, an effort will be made to formulate
an overview of the current situation and position of the indigenous
medical systems of the Middle East, South Asia, and East Asia.
We hope to discuss such issues as how practitioners are trained,
what their social position is, how potential patients choose medical
alternatives in cases where traditional medicine is available, the
extent to which coexisting medical traditions compete or cooperate,
and how these traditions are perceived and approached by external
elements (e.g. government, health services, welfare and charitable
institutions, etc.).  We would also like to consider the rising
interest in TAM in the West, and the factors underlying this.
The symposium will consist of one session on each of the three
traditions we propose to consider, followed on the second day by
a general discussion.  The symposium will be open to the public
and will be widely advertised; we expect that there will be considerable
interest among medical and other historians, medical practitioners
in general, and students.
The registration fee of 20.00 pounds covers 17.5% VAT and includes
morning coffee, buffet lunch (vegetarian options available), and
afternoon tea on both days.  A reduced rate of 14.00 pounds is
available to students, current full members of IASTAM, and members
of the Friends of the Wellcome Institute.
To register for the Symposium, please fill out the attached registration
form and return it with a cheque for the appropriate fee to the
conference secretary, Ms. Mohsina Somji, at the Wellcome Institute,
183 Euston Road, London NW1 2BE.  All registration fees must
be paid in pounds sterling by cheque or bank draft drawn on a UK
bank, or by Eurocheque, payable to the "Wellcome Institute for the
History of Medicine".
Members of IASTAM North America may pay the registration fees
in US dollars ($22.00) by check to the NA Chapter.  Please send
the registration form to Ms. Mohsina Somji in London now, but send
your check after 1 August and payable to "IASTAM North
America" to Dr. Steve Ferzacca, Dept. of Anthropology, Bryn Mawr
College, Bryn Mawr, PA. 19010.
The Wellcome Institute is located in the centre of London, with
excellent road, bus, underground, and rail connections to all parts
of the capital, Heathrow and Gatwick airports, and the rest of the
country.  There is a wide variety of hotel accommodation in all
price ranges within easy walking distance of the Institute.  While
participants in the Symposium will have to pursue such arrangements
on their own, we will be happy to provide recommendations, addresses,
and telephone numbers.  For accommodation arrangements and other
matters concerning the Symposium, please contact Ms. Somji by post
