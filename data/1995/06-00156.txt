>From what we understand, the
Carvakas emerged from the similar nastika (atheistic) strains that
contributed to the rise of Buddha and Mahavira and that they
shared the idea of the dualism of purusha (spirit) and prakriti
(substance) similar to the Samkhya school.

While we would like to know more about the Carvakas, our efforts
to locate sources through our own effort have resulted in shoonya
("zilch", sl.).

Would some knowledeable readers provide us with sources and
references for understanding more about the Carvakas, their
philosophy etc.?

Thanks,
