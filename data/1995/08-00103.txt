A dumb question.  While doing some editing, I've suddenly realized that I 
don't know whether brAhmin, as the name of a varNa, is a Sanskrit word.  
Of course, I know that brAhmaNa is probably more correct.  But how about 
brAhmin?  Or is it brahmin?  To be sure, "Brahmin" is in all my English 
dictionaries.  Is it an Indic word, or just an Anglicized form of brAhmaNa?

Thanks,

Lance
