Perhaps I jumped to an incorrect conclusion.  But I have to say that
the only historical writings in which I have ever seen the expression
"Indus/Saraswati civilization" used are in those of right-wing
revisionists.  Perhaps there are other publications I have missed where
the term is used neutrally.
