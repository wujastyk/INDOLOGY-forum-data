Sanskrit Translation
Hi!
I am not sure this is the right forum in which to ask this question, 
but if anyone can help out I'd be much obliged. Here goes:
I am looking for the meaning of the Sanskrit word "Sutra."
I know that it is ususally used to mean "story" or more particularly, 
"short story."
I would be interested to know if it also means "Thread," as in "the 
thread of a story."
If anyone knows please E-mail thuraira at pilot.msu.edu.
Thanks,
