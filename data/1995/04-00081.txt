Sanskrit fonts
Mario Eduardo Viaro asked about Indic language computer fonts. I
suggest you look at the constantly-updated listing of such fonts which
is available within the Inventory of Language Materials (ILM) under
TEACHING RESOURCES within The South Asia Gopher. The URL for direct
access to the fonts listing within ILM is:
gopher://gopher.cc.columbia.edu:71/00/clioplus/scholarly/SouthAsia/
Teaching/ILM/fonts.ilm
((Note articifial wrapping of the long-line of the URL above)).
Let me know if you desire specific directions for connecting to The
South Asia Gopher.
