Jainism/Buddhism in Tamilnadu

Has anyone ever suggested that this implied absorption of Buddhism into 
a growing fourth and fifth century Brahminic renaissance could be 
attributed to, in part, an emerging lay-buddhist ethic that 
Tathagatagarbha philosophy introduces in the third century?  Of course 
the main problem with this suggestion entails questioning how much 
exposure the laity had to such esoteric teachings as tathagatagarbha.
