Dear Dr. White,

regarding your enquiry on Sanskrit Manuscripts at Jodhpur you should know 
that the whole collection of Sanskrit manuscripts is preserved at 
PURATATTWA VIBHAGA, located in front of Jodhpur University. You should 
write to the Director, Puratattwa Vibhaga, Jodhpur, Rajasthan. They have 
published several fascicles of a descriptive catalogue.
