Hello list members
Someone has given me a copy of an illustrated life of Mirabai to look at. 
The text seems to be based on the Bhaktamala and Bhaktirasabodhani texts and 
is accompanied by twenty miniatures of scenes from her life. 
My question is this. Has anyone else seen such a manuscript or know of the 
existence of any similar manuscripts?
