Geldner's RV in English?-- no!
Rather than just a translation of Geldner, a fresh translation, that
takes into account more recent work on etymology/word studies would be
nice. Surya Kanta's dictionary lacks bibliography and the new
Mayrhofer is not quite affordable (and apparently not as widely
available as it should be; no public university library in Ohio seems to
have it).
Or is this just a pipe dream?
