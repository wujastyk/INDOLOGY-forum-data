Subject: translating sanskrit, ibm to mac

In answer to your letter.  I have been working on MLS4 for some time and 
it is equipped by a program called CTIU which can be used for translating 
documents much in the same way that you described.  ASCII tables of all 
langauge programmes used in MLS are available in the manual. 

I tried at one time to create an English to Sanskrit/Hindi conversion 
programme which is theoretically possible.  As far as I can see this may 
be limited to only PC compatible programmes. Some problems arise because 
of half characters and matras as you point out.  Most of this is not a 
great problem because they are written as overstrikes.  It simply means 
that you have to write each individual syllable as single character 
consisting of possibly more than one ASCII character.

Excuse my somewhat convoluted explanation but I hope that it is of some 
help.  If you have any further questions do not hesitate.
