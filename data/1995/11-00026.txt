Another source to check for Indo-Anglian (Indian English) is

The Cambridge History of the English Language (Vol. 5).

This volume, edited by Robert Burchfield, deals with 'English in Britain 
and Overseas: Origins and Development' (as its sub-title would indicate).
See particularly the section by Braj Kachru on "South Asian English" 
which contains an excellent bibliography (vide John Honey, prof. of 
English, Osaka International University, Japan, reviewing in _The Times 
Higher_, April 14, 1995, p. 23).
