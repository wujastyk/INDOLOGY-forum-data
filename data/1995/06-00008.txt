At the end of May Andrew O. Fort wrote about a course he was
teaching:
"Just a note to those interested in a variety of epic "versions"
or "tellings": I teach a course called "India: Texts and
Traditions" which focuses on different versions of the Raamaayana
and Mahaabhaarata." 
I would like to remind him and others on the list that there are
a vast number of other epic traditions on the sub-continent and
one need not limit oneself to the two literary classics. 
Students could be introduced to others by refence to _Oral Epics
In India_, ed. by Stuart Blackburn, et. al., University of
California Press, Berkeley, 1989.  Comparison of the oral and
literary epic tradition puts many aspects of South Asian
civilization into a more fruitful perspective.
