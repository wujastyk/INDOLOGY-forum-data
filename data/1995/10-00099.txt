Etymology of puujaa
Hi, Michael,  
Nice to read your views from time to time.  I learned a great deal from 
you during my stay at the CSWR.  
Speaking of puucu and puuja -- and the idea of smearing the guests--
In Hindu weddings and also in traditional Hindu homes in some parts of 
India (e.g., Andhra Pradesh) when a guest comes,he or she is smeared with 
Turmeric paste mixed with sandalwood paste either just under the chin and 
on the neck area or on the feet.  Thus there might be some relationship 
with the idea of honouring the guest.
