ABSTRACT
This paper offers a survey of current writing and practice within the
area of Buddhist environmental ethics. Consideration of the manner in
which sections of contemporary Buddhism have embraced a range of
environmental concerns suggests that four fairly distinct types of
discourse are in the process of formation, i.e. eco-spirituality,
eco-justice, eco-traditionalism and eco-apologetics. This fourfold
typology is described and examples of each type are discussed. The
question of the 'authenticity', from the Buddhist perspective, is
addressed to each type in turn.
