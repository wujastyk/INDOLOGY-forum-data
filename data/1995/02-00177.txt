As far as I am aware, as I found out from my former prof. James Benson, 
there really has not been much written about this.  They are rather 
interesting compounds within Panini's system (8.1.1 to about 15, I don't 
have my copy of the Ashtadhyayi at hand).  You might want to check 
Cardona's work on Panini.  If you get more bibliography, I would 
appreciate a forward with the information.
