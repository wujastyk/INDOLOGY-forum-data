I'm updating our Centre's Web page, again. I've tried one old and one new 
link that are giving me trouble. The old one is for the TITUS project on 
historical linguistics. I've tried these addresses:
	http://www.rz.uni-frankfurt.de/home/ftp/pub/titus/public_html

and
	as above, but with watson in place of www.

The first address gives me the reply that "the location is not 
recognized". The second address gives me the reply that "the server does 
not have a DNS entry". 

The new address is the one for the Asian Studies Network Information 
Center and for the SAGAR journal put out at the University of Texas at 
Austin. The addresses I have for those are:
	
	http://asnic.utexas.edu/asnic.html

and 

	http://asnic.utexas.edu/asnic/sagar/sagar.main.html

The response in each case is that I've got the wrong address. Thanks for 
any help that any of you may be able to give.
