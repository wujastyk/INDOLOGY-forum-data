Dear Members
I am interested in CakrapaaNidatta, who is one of the commentaters of 
Carakasamhitaa. I am not a specialist of AAyurvedic texts, but of VaizeSika. 
So
I have few information about CakrapaaNidatta. As far as my recognition, he
may preserve early or medival VaizeSika theory. I want to get more information
 
about him, his works, articles on him. If someone have such an
infromation, please teach me.
Best regards
Yasuhiro Okazaki
