Does anyone have any knowledge of the book listed below, and, in
particular, whether a copy fo same exists in North America? I found the
citation a number of years ago in a catalog of publications available
from Japan Publications, but when I tried to order it from them, it was
out of stock. Any help appreciated.  Thanks.
