Ancient South Asian word for 'cereal'

As I pointed out, you cited only the second syllable of the Munda form.
The <kug> syllable does not appear independently with the meaning `rice'.
Despite the Korku form */rum/ there is no evidence that */ruGkug/ (where
G is the velar nasal) is a compound form.  Here is the Munda evidence:
proto-Munda */ruGkug/ `uncooked husked rice': Sora /roGko/, Gorum
/ru~k(u)/, Gutob /ruku:/ (Ramamurti 1938), Remo /ru~ku/ (Fernandez),
/ruGku/ (Bhattacharya), Kharia /romku'b/, Juang /ruGkub/, Mundari
/roGko/.  [The velar to labial changes in Kharia after a labial vowel
are paralleled in other forms, and do not point to Korku /rum/.]
The forms you cited from IA and Dravidian are of the general shape
kaNk, as you noted, not kug.  
If you mean to compare the ku syllable of the Tamil form, isn't the
vowel simply the automatic enunciative vowel?
But none of this gets closer to Munda */ruGkug/.
Obviously, it's erroneous to compare only the second syllable of the
Munda word */ruGkug/ `rice' to the second syllable of the Sanskrit
form /kanku/ `millet', and then compare the remainder of the IA and
Dr. forms you cite to the first syllable of the Sanskrit form.  You
might as well compare English Here-ford `species of cattle' to English
horse and German Pferd, and note that cattle and horses are all farm
animals in the Germanic Kulturkreis.
