I'm going to spend a few months in India ( most probably winter time, 
but I am free up to the end of August 1996). Could anyone provide me 
with any details about a good place or a person that can help me  
improve my spoken Hindi and not ruin my pocket. I will have plenty of 
time, a limited sum of money, a recommendation letter from the Indian 
ambassador in Poland and strong will to become a good Hindi teacher.
 ( The only place I know about is Kendriy Hindi Samsthan in Agra, but I don't want to go there.)
