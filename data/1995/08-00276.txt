I came upon references to the 'Saindhavas.raavakas' in stories by Taranatha 
concerning Bodh Gaya (in a book that I think was called 'The origin of the 
Tara tradition' translated by David Templeman). They were according to 
Taranatha SriLankan Buddhists who violently opposed the Tantric Buddhists 
and, if I remember right, rioted and beat up Tantric Buddhists and tore down 
images of Tantric deities.
