On soma in the veda
     Mr. Christopher Fynn; thanks a lot for the info. Of course, during the 
     historical periods, soma is referred to as a creeper with appellations 
     such as soma-lata. My submission is that the textual references have 
     to be interpreted in the total context of the process involved in 
     making a product which seems to have been an important life activity 
     of the ancient rk-chanters. If it were hemp, it will reduce to pure 
     carbon too, if subjected to incessant firing/purification. 
     Kalyanaraman.

The Tibetan "so.ma ra.tsa"  or  "so.ma r'a.dz'a" 
(soma raajaa) is the word commonly used there 
for Indian hemp.
