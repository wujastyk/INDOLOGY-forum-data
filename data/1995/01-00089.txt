The problem seems to be the perception among all those who are
interested in Indian culture, either current or historical.
When they come across the term such as Indology they presume
that it deals with any and all topics related to India,
religious, cultural, literary and spiritual. You cannot blame
people for such expectations. For the founder and his patrons
at Liverpool University, this is a puzzle to solve and problem
to be resolved. It is not my place or station to make any
suggestions that may infuriate either one or other side of this
debate, My humorous contribution, along with two other already
posted, is to rename the list to prevent future encroachment.
How about 'Academic Indology', 'Scientific Indology', or
'Priestly/Pristine Indology'. That would stop some from
joining. As for the current young and restless crowd, I
suggest, send them to the Disney World with discount coupons.
Once they see and enjoy the real fun they woul not dare come
back to high and dry discussions among the academic
heavyweights.

I would like to end with a sanskrit saying: "Vade vade jayate
tattvabodh:"

Keep on trucking!
