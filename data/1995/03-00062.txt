Thank you Peter for understanding the motivation for the note. Any event 
that has the potential of interrupting the travel for students of 
indology is a valid subject matter for the list. When a xenophobic and 
terrorist group comes into power in a country which is the subject 
matter of the scholarly studies it is definitely a matter of concern. Do 
not tell me that the rampant terrorism in Egypt that has already taken a toll 
of several Egyptologists is not a matter of concern to other 
Egyptologists. When Combodia is under Pot Pol regime every scholar was 
concerned. When Nazis or Bolsheviks destroyed temples or churches, it was 
a matter of scholarly concern as well. 
I do not care for political parties and was not concerned when BJP came 
to power is many states but if a party comes into power and decides to 
destroy Taj Mahal because it was built by a king belonging to a different 
religion, the whole world would be worried.
