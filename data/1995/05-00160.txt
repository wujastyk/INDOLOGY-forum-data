Due to technical problems with a new software new subscriptions have been 
refused. 
Now everything works fine. If you still have problems please 
write directly to me and I will subscribe you manually.

SOme addresses cannot be reached by our machine. We will tune the 
sendmail configuration in the next few days. We keep a log of them and we 
will subscribe them. They DO NOT need to do anything but trying to 
subscribe once.

Thank you for your patience.
