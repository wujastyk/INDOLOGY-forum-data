Hello, my name is Narinderpal Singh Thethi. A month or so ago, I wrote to 
Jack Schofield of the Guardian, asking him if he knew where I might be able 
to purchase True Type Punjabi fonts. He did not know himself but gave me 
your email address as another source to try.
Do you know of any outlet that sells True Type Punjabi fonts?
I look forward to hearing from you soon.
