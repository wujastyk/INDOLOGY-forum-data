Sememe: ayana; sun and property
Dear Aditya,
A skeptic is essentially one who looks, who watches carefully.  If you
look carefully at what I wrote, you may notice that I was insulting
myself.  This is part of a grand old British tradition, the same 
tradition which would prevent me from ever even considering 
being rude to someone in public.
