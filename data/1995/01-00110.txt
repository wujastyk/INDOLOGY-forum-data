Tamil dictionary dispute
Dear Dr Malten,
Thank you for your message about the Tamil dictionary dispute.  It
clarifies the issues, and suggests to me, an outsider, that the matter
should be susceptible of ready resolution by experts.  (Unfortunately
that is not the normal way with Indian courts.)  I am sure that I speak
for many people when I sincerely hope the matter can be resolved quickly
and -- is it too much to hope? -- amicably.
