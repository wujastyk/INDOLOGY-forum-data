Seeking information on Vedic recensions.
Members,
I have been trying to find information about the Samaveda in terms of the 
upavedas, vedangas, upanishads, brahmanas, srauta sutras, and other 
various writings which originated from it. Accordingly, I am also 
looking for information about the saakhas, chaaranas, etc. and other 
recensions by which the Samaveda was studied and passed down.
Is there a "vedic encyclopedia" of sorts which details this sort of 
information, or am I asking for too much?
Thanks.
