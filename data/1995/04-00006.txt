Subject: the "svetaa"svatara and the paa"supatas
Message-ID: <161227019061.23782.13852730355516005513.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Can anyone point me in the direction of anything written about the paa"supata
vocabulary that appears in the "Svetaa"svatara Upani.sad?

I am thinking of the frequent occurence of paa"sa s; 
the statement that the sage "Svetaa"svatara was teaching atyaa"sramin s (6:21);
the identification of maayaa with prak.rti (4:10); the statement that \'Siva is
kaara.na (6:9); the occurence in the preceding verse of the expressions 
kaarya and kara.na; and the use of jaala apparently as a synonym of maayaa.

Dominic Goodall.
