JIABS
Dear members of the list,
I recently tried to contact the Journal of the International 
Association for Buddhist Studies (JIABS) for subscribtion, but got no reply
so far. Does anybody receive this journal and can tell me the
full address or person in charge, the way to subscribe and pay this
journal?
