Hello members of the list,

I am trying to identify and studying sections of guru bani and bhagata bani 
in, previously uncatalogued, manuscripts in a library in the UK.
Does anyone know of any form of on line/computer file version of the Adi 
Granth?  
Thank you for any help you can provide.
Peter Friedlander
