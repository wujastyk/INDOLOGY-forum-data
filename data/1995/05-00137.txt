Ancient rivers
In connection with my work on the Sarasvati River I'd like to know whether
there is any textual evidence from non-Vedic-related traditions for changes
in river courses motivated by the river's personal relationship with
certain people. Specifically, the ancient rivers I have in mind are: Amu
Darya (Oxus), Volga, Dniepr, Yang-tse-kiang (Chang Jiang), etc.
I'd appreciate any help in this regard.
Thank you very much.
