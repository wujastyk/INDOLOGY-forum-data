There is a false distinction current in linguistics: 
pragmatics/semantics.  I defy you to produce an intelligible translation 
of just about anything philosophical, and probably much else, without 
relying on pragmatic -- to include background, previously explicitly discussed, 
philosophic -- suppositions.  DISCOURSE CONTEXT disambiguates.  What we want 
is a translation that preserves discourse-relative meaning.  Gangesa did not
need to elabolate yogya-anupalabdhi, because he presupposes that his
audience will understand what he fully means.
