Dear Dominik,

I think you are taking just the right approach to keep INDOLOGY on course, 
and I look forward to participating in its work and discussions in 1995.  
I'm sure you have very strong majority support from list members for your 
sensible analysis of what INDOLOGY can and should be doing.

All the best,
Fran Pritchett
