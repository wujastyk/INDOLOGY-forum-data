Radhakrishnan's statement is not about advaita vedAnta specifically, but
about vedAnta in general. Page 23 of his work, "The Hindu View of Life",
a collection of lectures delivered in Manchester College, Oxford, has the
following line -

"The Vedanta is not a religion, but religion itself in its most universal
and deepest significance."

The emphasis in the first part of the sentence is on the "a", I suppose.
I would venture to suggest that the difference in Radhakrishnan's mind,
between "a religion" and "universal religion" is roughly analogous to 
that between "mata" and "dharma".
