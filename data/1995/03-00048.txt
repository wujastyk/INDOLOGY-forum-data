Sanskrit *apud* Classics again...and Hindi??
One department with Gk, Latin and Skt is the Department of Classics at
the University of Newcastle, New South Wales (Australia). Sanskrit there
was introduced by the recently-retired professor of classics, Godfrey
Tanner, who still teaches it on a part-time basis. I am not sure what
the prospect for jobs in future are; probably not all that large, since
student demand is small, but it might be worth dropping Prof Tanner a
line if you're interested in that part of the world. The address is Dept
of Classics, University of Newcastle, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia.
