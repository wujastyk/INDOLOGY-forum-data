Q: Titus URL?
I have had trouble lately linking from our Centre's web page to the page 
for the TITUS Project for Historical Linguistics. The address I have for 
that page is:
	http://www.rz.uni_frankfurt.de/home/ftp/pub/titus/public_html
Have I got the wrong address, or is the problem something else?
Thanks for any help,
Bob Hueckstedt
