Dr. Claus Peter Zoller
I am looking for an e-mail or other address for Dr. Claus Peter Zoller, 
once of Heidelberg University, and possibly living in India. He wrote 2 
papers in MSS 1988 and 1989 about an Indian language called Bangani, which 
has a remarkable Kentum substrate.
On the same subject, I am also looking for any other information and/or 
bibliographical references about this Bangani language.
Thanks,
