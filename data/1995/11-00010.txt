Peter Schreiner (Zurich) = pesch at indoger.unizh.ch

It is often worth checking the INDOLOGY membership list for this sort of
query.  There are now about 450 members, and you can get a list of their
email addresses by sending the message "review indology" to the address
"listserv at liverpool.ac.uk".
