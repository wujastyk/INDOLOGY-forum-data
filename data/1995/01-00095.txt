Environmental Concern in South Asia
I've been asked to edit a book on environmental concern in South Asian
religious for a good academic publishing house.  We are
trying to include a variety of perspectives (Hindu, Jain, Buddhist,
Muslim, etc.) and approaches (textual, anthropological, etc.).  I'm
particularly interested in the question of how religion influences
attitudes towards nature, animals, and so on. 
If anyone's doing work in this area, including either classical or 
contemporary South Asia, and would like to submit a short proposal 
I'd be delighted to hear from you.  I'm particularly looking for 
material on Vaisnava Vedanta and Tantra, i.e., what attitudes might 
emerge from these traditions regarding nature, etc.  Also Jainism and 
Buddhism in South Asia.
Best wishes,
