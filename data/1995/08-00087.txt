         Kalamekap pulavar
         *****************

Kalamekam has no equal in cilETai/iraTTuRa mozital and satire
as far as old tamil literature is concerned. His birthplace
is Ennayiram, a village in South Arcot district. We know this for sure,
because of a 17th century inscription of a tamiz veNpA from a Rajagopuram
at Kanchi Varadharaja Perumal temple. Dept. of Archaeology found this
dated & important poem in 1970's. It says:

There are two pretty  guys in the world - 
  "Beloved" is the name of the first one,
            He took strides across the whole world,
            and  hails from Srirangam;
  "Pouring Dark Cloud" is the title of the other,
            and  his nativeplace is Ennayiram.
