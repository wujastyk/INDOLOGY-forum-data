To those who usually correspond with me:

Kindly note that I shall be away from Vancouver, 3 Dec - 9 January, to
carry out some research in the Tirupati-Madras area and to attend a
conference in Madras (2-5 January).  Should you need to reach me for any
urgent matter, the secretaries in my department (604-822-3881/5728) should
be able to advise you on how to reach me.  Thanks. -- ashok aklujkar
