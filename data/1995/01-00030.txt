FIRST ENGLISH/PANJABI AND PANJABI/ENGLISH DICTIONARY
====================================================
AVAILABLE ON A COMPUTER SYSTEM
==============================
Akal Systems is happy and proud to announce on the auspicious day of Guru 
Nanak Dev Ji's 525th birthday the availability of "Panjabi Shabad Kosh" 
which is a Panjabi to English and English to Panjabi dictionary for IBM 
compatible computer systems running Windows.
The Panjabi Shabad Kosh has more than 23000 Panjabi and English words 
each. Users can look for the meaning of a Panjabi or English word when 
composing a document simply by clicking on the dictionary icon on the 
computer screen, without having to grab a dictionary from the bookshelf.
"Over the years several computerized fonts and others products have been 
developed by many well wishers of Panjabi and Gurmukhi alphabet. However, 
there was a lack of Panjabi/English computerized dictionary. Akal Systems 
has filled that need.
The program works on IBM compatible computers running Windows. It 
requires AnandpurSahib Font which is a Gurmukhi font developed by Maboli 
Systems of Virginia (USA). AnandpurSahib Font works with almost all word 
processing packages on IBM compatible systems.
Efforts are underway to make Panjabi Shabad Kosh compatible with other 
Gurmukhi fonts and make it available on the Macintosh computer in the 
future. The product has a user-friendly interface and is very easy to 
install. It works in the background and can be invoked anytime.
When a Panjabi word is entered, the Panjabi Shabad Kosh provides its 
meaning in English along with its linguistic characterics, e.g., verb, 
noun, adjective, etc. In addition, Shabad Kosh displays some phrases 
starting with that word. Similalry if one enters a word in English in 
the  dictionary mode, its meaning in Panjabi is displayed along with its 
linguistic characterics and axamples of its usage. The product allows you 
to build your own dictionary by allowing you to add or delete a world 
from the dictionary.
This intensive project took three years and a lot of financial resources. 
In the future Akal Systems plans to provide this product on Macintosh and 
other computer platforms as well. The product sells for $?? (US).
Punjabi is spoken by almost 115 million people in the world. Almost all 
the Punjabis in the Indian Punjab write Punjabi using Gurmukhi. The 
Punjabis in Pakistan use Farsi letters to write Punjabi.
Akal Systems is based in Cupertino, California (USA) and is a major 
supplier of other Punjabi/Gurmukhi computer programs and tools. It also 
provides multi-media based Gurmukhi/Panjabi learning tools called Punjabi 
Kaida,Punjabi Matra and Baal Bodh. For further information, you may 
contact Akal Systems at (408) 996-9404 or send me e-mail.
