Indology Web Page

This is one of the facilities already supported by the listserv software
we use for INDOLOGY.  Send a message "help set" to
"listserv at liverpool.ac.uk" and you will receive instructions about how
to tell listserv to save up INDOLOGY messages and post them to you as a
digest.
I used to read INDOLOGY in this form myself for a while, and it is
extremely convenient.  It makes INDOLOGY much less intrusive, and much
more like a little magazine.  But I found the downside was that it was
harder to respond to individual messages, since they are embedded in the
single INDOLOGY "issue", and you have to copy, cut, paste, and whatnot,
rather than just hitting the "r" key to reply to a particular point.
Swings and roundabouts.
Sorry, this is beyond my technical ability at the moment.  A good idea,
though!
