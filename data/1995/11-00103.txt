I am looking for detailed information on the invention of zero.  Did a 
Jain King in 300 BC ask his court mathematician to count the population in 
his kingdom, and the mathematician say that the numbers 1 thru 9 used at 
that time would not be convenient to add up a large number and invented 
zero. 

Also, does anyone have an E-Mail address for the Head, Department of Vedic 
Studies at Banaras Hindu University in India?

                        Thanks
