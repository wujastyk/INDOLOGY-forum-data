'Midnight's Children' problems.
Surely a South Asian childhood was a necessary but not sufficient 
condition for the creation of Midnight's Children and Rushdie's more 
recent work.  And he himself has commented on it, more than once.  See, 
for example, his writings gathered under the title Imaginary Homelands 
(Granta/Viking, 1991).  The title essay concerns itself with this 
question.  Moreover, Rushdie develops his thoughts about 
emigrant/immigrant writing in a world in which so many people are in 
transit -- rather than firmly rooted in their birthplace.  The 
increasingly common experience is that of living as a displaced or 
multilocal person.  Cinematic montage is not a required resource for this 
experience, but is relevant to it.
