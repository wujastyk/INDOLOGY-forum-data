Atheism in Hinduism: help needed
I don't know if other people receive the same format of messages, but
some of the messages I get have funny characters which show up as
"=20" on my terminal.  Is it possible to please configure your mail
software to insert hard returns or line breaks instead?  I am sure
that many other people on the list would be equally grateful.
Many thanks.
