Subject: Atheism in Hinduism: help needed
Message-ID: <161227021745.23782.2282280807414680955.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I am trying to find references dealing with the subject of atheism in
Hinduism. Its historical background, dialectics, the present place of the
atheist in Hindu religion compared to some other major religions, and all
that.

Any help is appreciated.
