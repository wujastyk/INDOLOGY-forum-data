Dear Indologists,

Does someone know of a book that contains the 108
names of each of the planets in nAmAvali format?  Or
perhaps does someone have an etext of the material they
would be willing to share?  I believe the stotrams are
from the Skanda PurA.nam, but my local library doesn't
have it.

Thanks for any information you can provide.
