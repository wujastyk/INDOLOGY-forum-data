Hello List members
I am trying to get copies of catalogues of Panjabi manuscripts and have 
found one published back in the early 60s and it gives (in Gurumukhi) the 
following addresses as places to get more copies:
'Director General of the department of the Languages of the Panjab
Patiala'
and
'Controler Printing and stationary department Chandigarh'
Does anyone know fuller forms of these addresses?
Or know any information about other more recent catalogues of Panjabi MS?
