2. If you can get hold of Devara's paper "From Mutsaddis to Marwaris" 
that would also be helpful. The reference follows:

3. IIM Ahmedabad has a case of the Parta system used by Marwari 
businessmen even today. You can possibly write for it or send 
e-mail to some there.
4. Prakrit Bharati in Jaipur is putting together a compendium 
of quotations from the classical texts pertaining to business 
and commerce. It should be ready soon. Someone has the proofs, 
I am sure.
By the way, what sort of evidence do we have for your ovbservation 
that Indians are high on the Power distance and Masculinity scale ? 
I had seen some work on Indian children which pointed to a very high
 power orientation. But this seems to be different.
