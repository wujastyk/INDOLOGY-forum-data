I take this opportunity to forward to everybody the list of language 
study programs that we maintain for the South Asian Gopher.  The Landour 
Language School might be a good one for Dr. Magnuszewska to consider.

*Languages:  HINDI with optional URDU in Varanasi, BENGALI in
       Calcutta, TAMIL in Madurai, sometimes other languages "such as
       TELUGU" on a tutorial basis, "as circumstances allow."
*Duration:  Summer Program:  ten weeks.  Academic-year Program:  one
       nine-month American academic year.
*Eligibility:  Applicants must be American citizens or permanent
       residents and "must be committed to a teaching career."
       Graduate students are preferred, but unusually qualified
       undergraduates may also be considered.  For the academic-year
       program, all applicants must have at least two years or 240
       hours of classroom language study before going on the program.
       For the summer program, applicants in Tamil or Bengali need

       applicants' home institutions may be used, or applicants may
       apply for AIIS fellowships.
*Applications due:  December 31st for both programs.

       "The program will be administered in India by AIIS staff.  This
is an intensive language program which provides four hours of
classroom instruction five days a week.  Classes are small and
individual tutorials are provided.  There will be regular assignments
outside of class, and participants must take part in all program
events, such as attending films, plays, and other cultural activities.
This is not a research program; participants are expected to devote
all their energies to activities which will increase their competence
in all areas of language skills--speaking, listening, reading, and
writing."

involved.  The real price is having to deal with the Indian
bureaucracy.
