IJTS WWW pages
Dear David,
every day after 5 p.m. and on Saturdays and Sundays the connections 
between USA and Italy are fast. 
Otherwise they are pretty slow.
Companies do not work and do not use the net on Sat. etc.
The problem is not our site or our machines.
Our Laboratory (Arcadia) uses two 2 Mb connections to Internet.
However, if anybody wants to offer us an account to host our WWW 
pages...it would be a gift form the heaven! (Of course we would update 
the pages ourselves)
Thank you for keeping me informed.
