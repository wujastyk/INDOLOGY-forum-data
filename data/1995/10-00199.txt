>	   This is an invitation from the Worldwide Indian Network (WIN) 
>	to all Indians to explore with us the possibility of developing 
>	effective and successful businesses.  Our goal is to lay the 
>	foundation of an organization within WIN that will facilitate 
>	communication and collaboration among people of varying skills 
>	and resources.  We intend to foster an entrepreneurial spirit 
>	among participants leading to the formation of new business 
>	enterprises.

>	   During the past half century, Indian politicians have talked 
>	themselves into oblivion.  Nevertheless, in each election they 
>	continue to get mandates from the people to lead the country in 
>	the same direction.  Meanwhile, Japanese workers have built an 
>	industrial marvel from a heap of ashes.  Today, Japanese 
>	productivity is 12 times that of India, and its per capita gross 
>	national product (GNP) is 105 times greater.
>
>	   Following Japan's example would be a good way for India to 
>	industrialize herself.  We have the main ingredient -- India has 
>	the second largest reservoir of trained manpower in the world 
>	(behind the United States).  What we seem to lack is an 
>	entrepreneurial tradition which enables us to take risks, and a 
>	spirit of cooperation which will make teamwork possible.

>	   Henry Ford is the idol of many businessmen; 66 million people 
>	around the world drive Ford cars every day.  Conrad Hilton is 
>	another idol of many businessmen; 110 thousand people around the 
>	world sleep in Hilton Hotels each night.  What we do not know is 
>	how many Fords and how many Hiltons failed to realize their 
>	ambitions.  Statistics show that 6.0% of start-ups in the United 
>	States fail in the first two years.  And only 62.4% of new 
>	businesses are still in existence ten years later.  We 
>	definitely don't want to fall into the wrong side of that 
>	statistic.
>
>	   To this end, we need an organization that will bring together 
>	individuals with complementary skills and a common interest in 
>	establishing businesses.  Unless one has the right combination 
>	of technical and managerial skills along with a sufficient 
>	amount of money, the odds are against successfully establishing 
>	a solo business.  If one has technical and managerial skills but 
>	lacks financial resources, one will need an investor to support 
>	any potential venture.  At the same time, investors and venture 
>	capitalists need to draw upon people with technical and 
>	managerial skills.
>
>	   In addition to the satisfaction we entrepreneurs would 
>	achieve for ourselves in establishing businesses, we would also 
>	contribute something to our country.  The formation of 
>	businesses creates jobs; in turn, the creation of jobs fuels 
>	economic growth and prosperity.  A healthy economy can relieve 
>	the misery and anguish of people by providing them with decent 
>	jobs and can enable them to prosper by offering affordable goods 
>	and services.
>
>	   Productivity -- efficiency or output per person -- will 
>	definitely take an upward turn once we form businesses.  First, 
>	when a person owns his own business, he will be completely 
>	committed to its success: he will have a heightened sense of 
>	responsibility, he will allow himself no excuses.  Moreover, a 
>	creative person, when working for someone else, is not always 
>	free to explore his own sense of creativity.  As a business 
>	owner, that same person is free to decide the best way to 
>	accomplish his objectives.  He will then act with creativity, 
>	good judgment, and with full awareness that the success of his 
>	business depends primarily on his efforts.
>
>	   Consumers have an enormous amount to gain if productivity 
>	improves.  Efficient production leads to better goods at lower 
>	prices, and lower prices mean people can have more: more food, 
>	more clothes, more leisure, more variety, more of everything 
>	money can buy.
>
>	   Each time the Government of India has devalued the currency, 
>	the leaders(?) have come up with a very persuasive argument for 
>	the illiterate masses: "Exports will improve substantially,"
