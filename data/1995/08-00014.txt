Query: intercourse during pregnancy in Hinduism/ 17th century C.E. 
*********************************************************************** 
From: Francois Quiviger <francois at sas.ac.uk> 
  
  
Dear Asianists, 
  
I am presently completing a section of a paper dealing with Roberto de' 
Nobili, an Italian Jesuit who founded an important mission in Madurai, in 
Southern India around 1605. In one of his works, written for his Brahman 
and Nayak converts, a passage dealing with marriage stipulates that it is 
not a sin to have intercourse with one's pregnant wife, provided that no 
harm is done to the child. This seems to me at odds with European manuals 
for confessors which prescribed severe penance for such a deed which they 
considered a sin, as it obviously goes again the doctrine of the Church on 
marriage. 
  
I suspect that De'Nobili was simply quite lenient in this case. The 
ascetic character of Brahman life probably led him to believe that this 
leniency would have been unlikely to breed excesses and as many Indian 
missionaries he was above all reluctant to burden the fragile faith of his 
new converts with the weight of unknown sins. Furthermore, as this text is 
written in Tamil it was unlikely to prompt much controversy... 
  
But before jumping to conclusions I wonder whether anyone could tell me if 
intercourse with one's pregnant wife is something admitted in Hinduism or 
indicate some texts where I could find an answer. 
  
  
                        My warmest thanks in advance.
