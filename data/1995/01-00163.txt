Hi,

I will be grateful to anybody on the list who can tell me the 

Address of "Shanti Darshan Belgo-Indian Association", or that of the 
editors of its bimonthly "India". 


I am looking for the following reference:

"Les Nagas, Montagnards entre l'Inde et la Birmanie" by Helene Willemart
"India" (bimonthly of Shanti Darshan Belgo-Indian Association) June 1992

Thank You in advance,

Dileep S Karanth
