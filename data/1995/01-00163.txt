Address of Shanti Darshan Belgo-Indian Association
Hi,
I will be grateful to anybody on the list who can tell me the 
Address of "Shanti Darshan Belgo-Indian Association", or that of the 
editors of its bimonthly "India". 
I am looking for the following reference:
"Les Nagas, Montagnards entre l'Inde et la Birmanie" by Helene Willemart
"India" (bimonthly of Shanti Darshan Belgo-Indian Association) June 1992
Thank You in advance,
Dileep S Karanth
