LOTUSES AND THE MOON
          Re: Lotuses or waterlilies and when they bloom 
          Someone, I believe it was Dominnik, asked if there were any truth 
          to  the  Indian poetic fancy  that certain lotuses or waterlilies 
          bloom when the moon rises.  I called up Lilypons Acquatic Gardens 
          in  Maryland,  one  of  the  largest waterlily nurseries  in  the 
          country, and  they said they  had never heard  of  such  a thing, 
          though of course there are plenty of them that bloom at night.  I 
          have also  read  a couple of  books  on  water gardening and  the 
          catalogs of five or  six other suppliers and none of them mention 
          anything like it.   I there were anything to  it,  they would use 
          the romantic charm of  the idea to sell the plants.  I  also have 
          never heard  of  any other nocturnal flowering plant  that  opens 
          only with the moon.
