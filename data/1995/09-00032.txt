Has anyone else ever come across the term
pratisenaa-aadars'a

a literal translation would be something like
"the opposing-army-mirror"

The term cropped up in some tantric material describing a meditational
process whereby the practitioner sees certain aspects of reality
in this `mirror (that is like?) an opposing army.'
