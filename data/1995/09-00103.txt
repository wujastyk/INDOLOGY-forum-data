Hello list members
A while ago somebody asked about Tulasidasa's famous dohA on women, drums 
and low caste people etc. being three subjects fit for beating. Recently I 
noticed a sabadI by BharatharI that seemed rather similar:

nArI corI jArI, tIna basta tyAgI
sati sati bhA.snta rAjA bharatharI, tenA.m dUratA varAgI .35

Roughly this might mean:
Women, thieves and ( jArI ?) are three things to be renounced.
Truly, truly says king Bharathari, (to renounce them) is renunciation.
I can send the reference to where this is if the original inquirer is  
interested. 
Perhaps there is a whole genre of 'three things worth renouncing'?
