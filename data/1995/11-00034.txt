Does anyone know much (or anything)
about the sages known as the Prsni-s?
They are mentioned in a text I am reading,
but that is it: they are named.
Who are they? What did they do?
Are they responsible for anything in particular?
Basically, anything about them or a reference
to them would be deeply appreciated.

This mention, btw, appears in Laksmidhara's commentary
to Saundaryalahari, v.11 in a section clipped from
the Taittirya Aranyaka which he calls the Arunopanisad.

Thanks in advance.
