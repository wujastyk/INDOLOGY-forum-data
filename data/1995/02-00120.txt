QUERY: The Vedic rishi, Shandilya.
I hope this query is in keeping with the precepts of the mailing list.
I am trying to find out anything about the rishi Shandilya. I have 
checked the materials at the libraries at my University and have not been 
able to uncover anything except that he was the authour of a few sections 
of the Sathapatha Brahmana.
If anyone can provide me with any information, I will greatly appreciate 
it. If you are able to provide me with assistance, please email me 
directly at <apandey at u.washington.edu>.
Thank you very much.
