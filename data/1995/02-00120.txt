Subject: QUERY: The Vedic rishi, Shandilya.
Message-ID: <161227018570.23782.11258564618798419725.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>


I hope this query is in keeping with the precepts of the mailing list.

I am trying to find out anything about the rishi Shandilya. I have 
checked the materials at the libraries at my University and have not been 
able to uncover anything except that he was the authour of a few sections 
of the Sathapatha Brahmana.

If anyone can provide me with any information, I will greatly appreciate 
it. If you are able to provide me with assistance, please email me 
directly at <apandey at u.washington.edu>.

Thank you very much.
