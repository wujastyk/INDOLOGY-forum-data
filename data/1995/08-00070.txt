World Sanskrit Conference secretary sought
Word reaches me from Bangalore that the organizers of the next World
Sanskrit Conference are again on the lookout for someone who could work
in Bangalore for the better part of a year, specifically to help with
the job of liaising with foreign (non-Indian) scholars.  The person for
this job would need to have good organizational skills, and some
familiarity with computer databases.
The work is based at the Taralabalu Kendra, in Bangalore.  This
Virashaiva centre can offer office space, and simple accomodation if
necessary.
I believe this would be a pleasant job, and a good opportunity to
be in Bangalore.  The Taralabalu people are delightful, and the team
there is very keen that the conference should run well.
If anyone is interested in following up, please contact the organizers
directly:
Dr Shivamurthy Swamiji,
Taralabalu Kendra,
3rd Main, 2nd Block,
R.T. Nagar,
Bangalore 560 032,
INDIA.
