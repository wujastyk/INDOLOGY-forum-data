the list......each time I'm logged on....(once a day at least..). When I 
suggested to you a netiquette, I suggested to 
be silent unless you understand the geenral tone, the topic, etc.. Just 
like when you enter a new house of foreign hosts....
Yes, there are general rules...unless the group has determined new rules..

However, regarding the many interesting questions you asked me, I will 
reply to you privately. I am sorry for the delay. I will also send the 
address of that list I mentioned already...
Best regards
