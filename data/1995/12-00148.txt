How do you think the publisher would respond to a request from a 
Sanskritist-librarian to have it on a p.c. at his work, but NOT hooked up 
to the library's mainframe, so that it cannot be consulted by people in 
other parts of the library or people hooking up to the library's 
databases from offsite?  I ask before I send the requested email to the 
publisher so I won't get turned down or alarm them, and send this message 
to the list as well as to Peter Schreiner because it may be of interest 
to other librarians on the list.
