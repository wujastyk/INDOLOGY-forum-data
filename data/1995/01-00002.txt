Dear Birgit,
Doubtless you are familiar with the Parmenides. And with Pelletier,
"Parmenides, Plato, and the Semantics of Non-Being".
   I was prompted to make a recension because I am in daily contact
with a Non-dual Master who knows by continuous direct experience
the reality of Nonduality, which is the same as experiencing what
Parmenides describes. Best wishes and happy new year.
