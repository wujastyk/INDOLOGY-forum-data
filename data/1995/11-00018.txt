The American College, Madurai has a very extensive collection of 
Anglo-Indian or Indo-Anglian literature, which is on a computer catalog 
which will be hooked up to internet in a few months.  Mr. Gnanaprahasam 
Reuben, a librarian at its Daniel Poor Memorial Library is on a Fulbright 
grant here at the Graduate School of Library and Information Science of 
Simmons College and was by the Library of Congress on a tour a couple of 
weeks ago. 

I called up Fulbright which seems to have a policy against giving out 
people's current addresses and his contact there said she would pass on 
to Mr. Reuben the fact that I was trying to contact for a researcher.

A quick search of the World of Learning and a couple of other reference 
books fails to turn up anything under American College Madurai or Madurai 
American College.  I'll wait to hear from Mr. Reuben before further 
pursuing the address in reference books.
