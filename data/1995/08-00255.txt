The reading akke might stand for arkke, for especially in South 
Indian scripts r is often a minimal stroke, while the stops are doubled 
after r. Apart from the verse quoted, I have not come across references 
to honey in connection with arka, commonly identified with Calotropis 
gigantea. This large shrub is "common in the plains of Northern India and 
in the Peninsula...Lower Burma (Kurz). Ceylon. Malay Penins. and Archip." 
(Dietrich Brandis, Indian trees, London 1906, p. 471). For the Vedic 
symbolism of arka, see Zatapatha-BrAhmaNa 9,1,1,4;9;42 and 10,3,4,3-5.
