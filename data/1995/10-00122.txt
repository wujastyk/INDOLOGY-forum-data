Dear Dominik,

can you please give me this reference to the study of "citta" and
 "ahamkAra"? When you are at it, you mentioned recently your 
interest in the history of science in South Asia. 
Is there some good book written recently that you can suggest? 

More generally, can Indology members suggest introductory 
books on themes and concepts found in Samkhya that can be used 
for Philosophy introductory courses? I am looking for  
(Analytic Philodophy style)conceptual 
elucidations  on conepts like "Buddhi", "ParinAma", "jIva" etc. Though
 I studied Indian Philosophy back in 70s in India, it was of a very very
 elementary nature, and since then my acquaintance with books on
 Indian Philosophy are of chance encounters. Though I have come across 
some text books written specifically for American College courses, 
 they appear to me more of the nature of general introduction to Indian 
civilization rather than on the conceptual specificities of Indian Traditions. 

My intention to look into Indian philosophy is the following: I surmise 
that possibilities of  alternative types of conceptualising the human faculties 
can be found in concepts like "Buddhi" - which is not the same as the notion of 
"intellect" or "reason" as found in the Aristotelian and Modern philosophical 
traditions.   

If possible, I want to combine my study with the teaching obligations I have. 
In German Universities, a course is constitued by a  weekly session of a
hour and a half  for 13 to 14 weeks. The course is generally through 
reading the texts and discussing it. I am wondering whether reading 
the sAmkhya kArikA (of course, in translation) together
 along with commentaries and secondary texts would be an option. 
Any suggestions? 

Thanks in advance to all those who are willing to help.
