Vyomavatii's Mysore Manuscript
On Sun, 10 Dec 1995 03:26:23 GMT you wrote about a MS in Mysore that
you would be interested in seeing.  I am going to be in Mysore, at the
Oriental Manuscripts Library, in about four weeks, specifically to
chase up some manuscript microfilm orders of my own.  If you can give
me full details of the MS you are interested in, I can ask the
librarian about it, and order a copy for you. Perhaps we can
correspond privately about this.
Best wishes,
