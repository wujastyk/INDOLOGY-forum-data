                    CALL FOR PAPERS
   WORKSHOP ON LOGICAL SOLUTIONS TO THE FRAME PROBLEM

   The American Association for Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) is
sponsoring this workshop in Lawrence, Kansas from March 23 to March 25,1987.
   The frame problem is one of the most fundamental problems in
Artificial Intelligence and essentially is the problem of describing in
a computationally reasonable manner what properties persist and what
properties change as action are performed.  The intrinsic problem lies in
the fact that we cannot expect to be able to exhaustively list for every
possible action (or combination of concurrent actions) and for every
possible state of the world how that action (or concurrent actions) change
the truth or falsity of each individual fact.  We can only list the obvious
results of the action and hope that our basic inferential system will be
able to deduce the truth or falsity of the other less obvious facts.
   In recent years there have been a number of approaches to constructing
new kinds of logical systems such as non-monotonic logics, default logics,
circumscription logics, modal reflexive logics, and persistence logics which
hopefully can be applied to solving the frame problem by allowing the missing
facts to be deduced.	This workshop will attempt to bring together the
proponents of these various approaches.
   Papers on logics applicable to the problem of reasoning about such
unintended consequences of actions are invited for consideration.  Two
copies of either an extended abstract or a full length paper should be
sent to the workshop chairman before Nov 20,1986.  Acceptance notices will
be mailed by December 1,1986 along with instructions for preparing the final
versions of accepted papers.  The final versions are due January 12,1987.
  In order to encourage vigorous interaction and exchange of ideas
the workshop will be kept small -- about 25 participants.  There will
be individual presentations and ample time for technical discussions.
An attempt will be made to define the current state of the art and future
research needs.
	Partial travel support (from  AAAI) for participants is available.

Workshop Chairman:

Subject: Language and Information


I just received an announcement of the 28th annual Bampton Lectures in
America.  (It's called an `invitation', but it also says `no card of
admission required'.  An enquiry to the Office of the Secretary, 308 Low
Library, would clarify how open it is.)

Past lecturers have included Steven Weinberg, Jacob Bronowski, Fred
Hoyle, Northrop Frye, Paul Tillich, Lewis Mumford, and Arnold Toynbee.

Dates:  October 7, 8, 14, and 15, 1986
Time:   5:30
Place:  The Rotunda, Low Memorial Library, Columbia University
Speaker: Zellig Harris
Series title:  Language and Information

The individual lectures are entitled as follows:

	Tuesday, October 7      A Formal Theory of Syntax
	Wednesday, October 8    Science Sublanguages
	Tuesday, October 14     Information
	Wednesday, October 15   The Nature of Language

The announcement text follows:

	The formal development of structural linguistics,
	transformational and discourse analysis, and the elaboration of
	global mathematical structures in a natural language are, in
	large measure, due to the work of Zellig Harris.  This work,
	with its constructive orientation, has established his
	reputation as a leading scientist here and abroad.  His recent
	work--the subject of these Bampton lectures--sets forth a formal
	theory of syntax and establishes its implications for discovery
	of structures of information in science and the understanding of
	the nature of language.  <Biographical information, including
	the following:  Harris founded the first linguistics department
	in America, at the University of Pennsylvania, and since 1980 he
	has been Senior Research Scientist at the Center for the Social
	Sciences of Columbia University.>

	<Bibliographical information, including following:>  Harris is
	the principal author of _The Form of Information in Science_
	(forthcoming in the series Boston Studies in the Philosophy of
	Science) and his _Mathematical Approach to a Theory of Language_
	is to be published by Oxford University Press.

For some indication why this is especially relevant for computational
linguistics, see my review of Harris' 1982 book, _A Grammar of English
on Mathematical Principles_, which appeared in _Computational
Linguistics_ 10.3-4 (1984).  I guess this review is the reason I
received the invitation.
