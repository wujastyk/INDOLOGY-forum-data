moderating not moderation

I would expect so.  One doesn't join a list on Buddhism and then start a 
discussion on Paul Tillich.  The topics of most list are clearly 
demarcated.  Perhaps, this list should go about demarcating more clearly 
what classical indology means.  Once this is clear to everyone, then 
netiquette for this list would be clear.  I am certain that everyone here 
would be quite vocal if someone began a discussion on Church History; a 
topic which is clearly outside of the confines of this list.  Again, 
"classical Indology" should be further defined and clarified.
