e-text of Arthazaastra available
Michio Yano and his colleagues have made yet another Sanskrit text 
available in machine-readable form: 
Many thanks, Michio, and please pass my gratitude to the team who prepared 
this text.
I have made copies of this version of the Arthasastra, as well as the 
Brhatsamhita, at the London site ftp.bcc.ac.uk:ftp/pub/users/ucgadkw/indology.
These copies are the same texts, but zipped instead of compressed.
