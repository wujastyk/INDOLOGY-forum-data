Sarvangi of Gopaldas
The Library of Congress record for the book gives the title: The Saravagi of
Gopaldas (with appropriate macrons).  Perhaps the difference in romanization
is the reason Prof. Fosse's librarian could not locate the book.  It should
be widely held by libraries.  Bill Alspaugh, U. of Chicago Library
