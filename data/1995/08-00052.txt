Q: Skt. competition in Poona
First, I thank all of you for your responses to my recent questions. If 
anyone wishes to see the near-final draft of my little article, now 
called "The North American University and South Asian Classics", and 
offer more suggestions for improvement, please respond directly to me, 
and we'll work out how best to do it. (I'm one of those people with a 
"peculiar personality", so I use TeX. Which is good, because the document 
requires, besides English, Greek, Tamil and Devanagari fonts, all of 
which TeX handles beautifully.)
I would still like to know when the Wales Chair was established at 
Harvard. And I would still like to know the language(s) in which the 
_Cuulavamsa_ was written. 
Another, and probably last, question is this: I remember being told many 
years ago that there was an annual competitiion in Poona for the writing 
and production of Sanskrit plays. Does anyone know if that competition is 
still operating, and if so, for how many years has it been held?
Gratefully,
Bob Hueckstedt
