This is a generic message to all those Sanskritists who are using my "A 
Sanskrit Primer."  If you intend to use this textbook for your classes in 
the future, please do not use its pre-1995 editions for your classes.  I 
have made numerous corrections and additions in the 1995 edition, and I 
would like the students to use this latest edition.  If you have any 
questions regarding this, please contact me at:  mmdesh at umich.edu.
	Thanks.
