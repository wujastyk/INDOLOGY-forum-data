Dear Members,
 
For a paper I am writing I would like to know where I could find
a good discussion of descent (clans, lineage, kula, wamsa, etc.)
from the sun and the moon in ancient (vedic, kavya, puranic,
sastric, sangam) Indian literature.  I'm sure there is a vast
amount to be found in various primary sources, but what I would
like for the present, at least, is secondary sources with good
discussion and references.  Can anyone help?
 
The paper, for those who may be interested, will be on a South
Indian community called Gollas ("cowherders") and representations
of dual oppositions.  Hopefully, it will be presented at the 1995
Madison South Asia Conference, but I would be happy to mail (by
post because it contains photos and diagrams) to those who would
like to have a copy.
