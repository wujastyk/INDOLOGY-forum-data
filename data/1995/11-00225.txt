Good morning listers,
as for 
<stuff deleted>
I want to remind, that it is only the TEXT we have, everything we say 
about the INTENT of the author is more than the text; we never can 
know the intent of the author, but deal with the meanings of the text.
The older the texts, the more dangerous it is to try to speculate 
with the intent/s of the author, especially when we have texts from 
the cultures from which so much is disappeared.
Sincerely,
