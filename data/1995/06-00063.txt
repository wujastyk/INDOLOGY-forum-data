NAME FOR A BABY GIRL
A. Thrasher is quite right to point out that there is at times
a risk of confusion between `free' and `libertine.' As the
latter word indicates, this difficulty is not specific to India.
One may suggest the classical Tat'A-takai for an invincible
female warrior woman. It would, of course, carry the connotation
of a tomboy, but she turned out fine anyway...
Regarding Y. K. Malaiya's suggestion of PArvati, etc...,
it is important to stress that all names of Sakti or
Lakshmi etc..., imply a reference to the ultimate freedom,
one which is not defined as the removal of a restraint
(what could possibly restrain Brahman in the first place?).
