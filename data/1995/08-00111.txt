Brahmin? -Reply
Actually, I've always understood brAhmaNa ("one who knows brahman")
as a patronymic of the neuter brahman ("spirit", not to be confused
with the masculine brahman, which becomes brahmA in the nominative). 
And as Mani pointed out, I've understood "brahmin" to be an
anglicization of brAhmaNa (as in "Boston brahmins" referring to the
intellectually elite of the city).
