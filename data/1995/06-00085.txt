I have been asked to provide more technical citations on Sarasvati river. 

I will be happy to provide, to interested indologists, extracts from the
following, mainly geological, bibliographical references compiled in a 6-page
note which seeks to substantiate the expanse of the Harappan culture on the
Indus_Sarasvati river valleys. [I shall be grateful for help on obtaining
copies of A-4 size photographs and slides of the landsat images contained in
some of these references.]
