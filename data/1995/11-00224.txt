JOURNAL OF SOUTH ASIA WOMEN STUDIES -- Vol. 1, No. 1 (ISSN         1085-7478)
Glad to hear that the journal is out.
It would probably be a good idea to relay the message to the following ng
address:
third-world-women at jefferson.village.virginia.edu.
To subscribe, email Radhika Gajjala at <gajjala+ at pitt.edu>.
The input of third world women would be helpful. And interesting too.
