COULSON'S TEXTBOOK
          On  Coulson's "Teaching Yourself Sanskrit."  I  taught elementary 
          Sanskrit a year or two using it.   I would have to review all the 
          textbooks currently available before I ventured which is the best 
          overall, but  I would say that the  most useful aspect of  it  is 
          that  it teaches first  the constructions that  are actually used 
          the  most  in classical Sanskrit (e.g. passives come earlier than 
          in previous textbooks, and so  do participial constructions).  On 
          the  other hand,  its taking its examples mostly from  kavya  has 
          left  it  with  a  vocabulary that  doesn't  represent  the  core 
          vocabulary of Sanskrit literature as  a whole as  well  as  other 
          textbooks; a  number of  words scarcely appear outside of  kavya, 
          and the student interested in epics, puranas,                     
          philosophy-theology, astronomy, medicine, etc.  is  left  with  a 
          weaker core vocabulary at the end  of  the year, not enough words 
          for "horse, lotus, intelligence, liberation," and the like.
