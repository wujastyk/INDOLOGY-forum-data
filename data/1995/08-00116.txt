Brahmans on the South Coast
Dear indologists,
In his book on Roberto De'Nobili (1972) Fr Bachmann points out that high
caste converts were ostracised. Since they could not marry non Christian
Brahman women some remained single and *some moved to the Coast*.  I
assume that by *the Coast* he means Portuguese territories, but
unfortunately Bachmann does not give any reference or says whether these
Brahmans affiliated themselves in some way to the Saint Thomas Christians
or simply to the Christian communities. Can anyone suggests a source for
Bachmann statement? 
			Many thanks in advance.
