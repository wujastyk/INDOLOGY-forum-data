Gopher archives up to date (July 95)
The archives for the lists:
	sophia
	philos-l
	indology
are now up to date and contain the last completed month (July). It is 
hoped to provide WWW access, and provide access to the latest 
archives (to the day) soon. The URL is
gopher://gopher.liv.ac.uk/11/lists
If you have any questions/complaints about this, please do not discuss
them on the list since I will not see your mail but mail me directly at
