Pratap Kumar raised the issue of Hinduism and Buddhism/Jainism
I think that one of the problems with the view he opposes is the term 
'Hinduism'. It seems safer to me to use Hinduism to refer to later 
developments in India, perhaps not before the period of epic literature say 
ca. 2nd century BC.
Hence there is no way that Buddhism and Jainism can be offshoots of 
Hinduism.
Moreover, while some aspects of the sramanic traditions, including Buddhist 
and Jain traditions, do reflect attacks on for instance Brahminical ritual 
observances, I do not believe that most aspects of sramanic traditions can 
be explained in this way.
Also I have never seen a Buddhist or Jain text that is a criticism of 
Upanisadic thought, this to me suggests that the popularity of the Upanisads 
most post date early Buddhism and Mahavira. So it does not seem that 
Jacobi's view that Jainism is a popularised form of Upanisadic thought can 
be correct.
