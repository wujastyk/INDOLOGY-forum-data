Mutiny on the Indology
To Sid, who 's such a way with words
(I wonder if he's good with curds?)
I'd say, your rhyming makes me partly dazed
your poems leave me half amazed!
Let me remind you of the words of Keats,
that man of unsurpassed poetic feats:
"Heard melodies are sweet," (I'd bet!)
but those unheard are sweeter" (yet).
Best regards,
