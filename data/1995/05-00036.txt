Hello Professor Beach, I wondered whether you would consider
showing a video to your students.  I am experimenting with
the idea of showing Peter Brook's The Mahabharata in my
summer course on Hinduism (apart from a number of other
videos).  Since even Brook's Mahabharata is very long,
I will break it up into several segments.  It is modern,
upbeat and perhaps quite attractive (but then it may too
stylized for your students).

As for the recommendation of Dimmit's and van Buitenen's
Purana Reader, I am enjoying it with my students.

I also find the translation of the Ramayana by Laksmi Lal
very legible. The book is available from South Asia Books
in Missouri. Very inexpensive paperback.

In the past I engaged professional storytellers, who 
either specialize in Indian materials or have one or
two stories or episodes well mastered to perform.

What translation of the Bhagavadgita were you using?
I personally prefer the one by the late Barbara Stoler
Miller.

I thought I would like to share a few ideas with you since
we are neighbors, I am at Indiana University in Bloomington.
Best of luck. Edeltraud Harzer Clear.
