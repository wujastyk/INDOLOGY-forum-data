An annotated list of South Asian language computer fonts (including many for
Sanskrit for the Mac) can be found within the South Asia Gopher (instructions
below), in the following path: 

  South Asia Gopher
    Teaching Resources on South Asia
      Inventory of Language Materials
        South Asian Language Computer Fonts

----
To connect to the South Asia Gopher, you may use any of three
techniques: gopher, telnet, or WorldWideWeb:


Simply gopher to: <gopher.cc.columbia.edu 71>; and then navigate down
through the menus as follows (Be sure to use port 71):
CLIO Plus/SELECTED TOPICS/South Asia.

If you have gopher client software, use the following pointer ('bookmark'):
	Type=1
	Name=The South Asia Gopher
	Host=gopher.cc.columbia.edu
	Port=71
	Path=1/clioplus/scholarly/SouthAsia

---------> OR BY TELNET:

Simply telnet to: <columbianet.columbia.edu>. Once connected to
Columbianet, select the menu item marked "CLIO Plus." Within that menu,
you'll find an item on the list labelled "SELECTED TOPICS: Internet
Resources By Subject" Select that one, and within it you'll find the South
Asia Gopher! 

---------> OR BY WORLD WIDE WEB:

If you use MOSAIC or Lynx or other web-browser, use this URL:
