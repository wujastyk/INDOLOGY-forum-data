Muslims, was the "PC" Card
	The lively debate between Conlon and Tartakov on the one hand and 
J.B.Sharma and Peter (?) Lusthaus on the other, has been useful and 
instructive (so far). To put it in a proper perspective we need to 
analyze the condition of the Hindu minority in Muslim countries. Perhaps a 
beginning could be made by generating a bibliography of studies that 
already exist on this topic.
