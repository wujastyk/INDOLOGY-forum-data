Etymology of kSatriya
Narahari Rao said:
The articles I had in mind were published in the JAOS in the late
fifties or early sixties, I think.  They are probably reprinted in:
  _Studies in Indian literature and philosophy: collected articles of J.
  A. B. van Buitenen_, edited by Ludo Rocher (Delhi: Motilal, 1988).
On reflection, I think he discussed ahamkara and atman, rather than a.
and citta.  Anyhow, samkhya concepts.  I remember the articles as being
very useful and insightfully written.
