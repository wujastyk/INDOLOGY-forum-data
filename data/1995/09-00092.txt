Q: Indian Art Graduate Study Programs
Fellow Indologists,
I have a student this year who has just told me she is interested in 
pursuing graduate work, or some form of further study, in Indian art. She 
only knows about one program -- one run by Sotheby's in conjunction with 
SOAS. I did not try to dissuade her from that program: I assume it is a 
good one, but she was surprised to know that there were many other places 
where one could study Indian art. My suggestions were Harvard (are Pramod 
Chandra and Stuart Cary Welch still there?), someplace in Ohio (where are 
the Hutchinsons?), and maybe the Asia Society in New York. I don't know 
of any place in Canada. I also suggested that there may be a program in 
conjunction with the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, which has a good 
collection of Indian art.
I'm sure my suggestions are incomplete. I'm sure there are good programs 
about 
which I am totally ignorant. If any of you know of them, please educate 
me. She's a good student, and I'm sure would do well wherever she goes. 
Gratefully,
Bob Hueckstedt
