title pages are missing, but nothing of substance is lost. From the last
page, that is, p. 1066 (yes, the text is that extensive), it is evident
that the edition was printed at  'Srii-baala-manoramaa Press, Mailaapuur,
Madras. The type confirms this specification. Sanskrit texts produced by
the Shribalamanorama Press of Madras deserve the same recognition for
neatness in the history of Indology as the texts produced by the
Nirnaya-sagara Press of Bombay.
