Sankara etexts
I am forwarding this request which I picked up on another list:
                        ********************
Request
One of the PhD students at the University of Queensland, David
Dargie, is researching authorship in Sanskrit documents in the
period 500-800AD.
Does anyone know of:
1.      an OCR (hardware or software) for Devanagari
2.      machine readable corpora from this period, especially
                for Sankara
3.      concordance and quantitative data for Sanskrit
Many thanks,
