	It's nice to be appreciated.

	By the way, Richard is referring to _Pramaa.navaartika_, 
Pramaa.nasiddhiparicchedam v, 85. The penetration of gold by mercury is 
cited as an example for the position that aggregated matter is not 
necessarily impermeable. I suspect that the commentator Devendrabuddhi 
may have more to say on this issue, but since I am also on my way to the 
AAR, I cannot check the reference. Let me know if I can help you upon my 
return next week.
