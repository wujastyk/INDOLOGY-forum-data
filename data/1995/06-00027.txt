howsoever illogical Dr Kalyanraman's comments may have been but he must have
some credentials to have earned a doctorate and does not deserve ad 
hominem invectives.
I am also aware of the fact that Dominik is a (the?) founder of this 
mailing list and may control whatever gets posted here.
I would like to know what motivates people not connected with Indian 
heritage to study "indian scriptures" in the first place. Do they 
consider this study a part of anthropology and/or a  study of primitive
cultures in their attempt to look down the Indian culture and religions 
in general?
Is it not a fact  that the study of Indology in the west was originally 
conducted only by christian missionaries who just wanted to ridicule the 
Indian religions in order to covert the local population into still more 
irrational christian faith?
As is obvious from my mail header, I am not a fanatic of any religion but 
would not like any one religion being criticized by believers of whatever 
other faiths. I am also not a supporter of BJP or Hindutva philosophy and 
more at odds with them than most Indians or Westerners themselves.
