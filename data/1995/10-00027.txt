I seem to have no trouble connecting to this adress. The server in
Frankfurt actually re-routes the connection to the new url (with
watson), so that your browser indicates that you're connected to the
latter (even though you typed in the former). When I directly type in
the 'watson' url, again, I have no difficulty connecting to this
address.
Perhaps your network's connection to the Domain Name Serv er (DNS) was
down, and so failed to look up the numerical (IP) address for the
named host...

Again, I have no trouble connecting to these. Must be something wrong
with the nextwork or DNS connection at your end.
