Prof. Walter Maurer at the University of Hawaii has just published a new
Sanskrit grammar and reader consisting of 32 lessons to be used over a two
year course of study.  I saw a pre-publication manuscript for the book and
think it would be worth investigating as a possible beginner's textbook. 
It would, of course, be wise to get the opinions of those who really know
and teach the language (neither of which apply to myself).
