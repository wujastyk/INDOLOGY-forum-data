keeep indecency alive! (fwd)
Dear members of Indology, I do not know anything of what is said below,
however this seems to be of quite universal importance, so please forgive me
forwarding this which is of non-indological concern. Also apoligizes for any
crossposting, which seems to be quite probable in this case.

               somewhere)
