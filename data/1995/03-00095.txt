Question re nyagrodha
I agree. Aerial roots are of no significance in the metaphor, which
conforms to the well-known archetype of the inverted tree, rooted in
heaven with branches growing downwards. This is all that is required for
the metaphor, as in Rgveda I,24,7:
 abudhne raajaa varuNo vanasyordhvaM stuupaM dadate puutadakSaH //
 niiciinaaH sthur upari budhna eSaam asme antar nihitaaH ketavaH syuH //
Different kinds of trees do the work in different traditions; e.g. in
Dante's Purgatory XXII,131-134:
 un alber che trovammo in mezza strada
 con pomi a odorar soavi e boni
 e come abete in alto si digrada
 di ramo in ramo, cos? quello in giuso
where it is an apple tree tapering downwards like an inverted fir tree.
