Subject: Bookstores in Madras?
Message-ID: <161227021241.23782.7588734706506072638.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

My wife and I will be going to Madras early next year. I would like to
purchase some sanskrit books while I'm there.

Does anyone have recommendations regarding indological bookstores? Does
Motilal have a store in Madras? Is the Adyar Library still alive and well?

Any advice would be most welcome. Thank you all.
