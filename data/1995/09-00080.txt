A third translation of Samkara's Gitabhasya (in addition to those of
Krishna Warrier and Mahadeva Sastri already mentioned by members of the
list) is:

Bhagavadgita with the commentary of Sankaracarya, translated by Swami
Gambhirananda, 2nd ed. (Calcutta: Advaita Ashrama, 1991).

This does not include the Sankrit text of the Bhasya, though it does
include the Sanskrit text of the Gita.  The Ashrama's Publication
Department's address is listed on the title page as 5 Dehi Entally Road,
Calcutta 700 014.
