Dear Mr. Nelson,
I would propose to contact the members of the Indological Dept. of the 
University of Hamburg (Schmithausen, Wezler, Srinivasan et al.) who have 
specialized on environmental topics during the past years.
You could contact them through quessel at orientalistik.uni-hamburg.de who 
works in the same department and would certainly forward your messages.
Sincerely, yours Axel Michaels
