I would have thought of a rather later date than this, but I agree with the
sentiment.

All three are no doubt the product of rather complex mutual influences
within Indian religion as a whole.

Agreed.

Although I don't subscribe to the view here attributed to Jacobi, this
perhaps goes too far. In recent years both K.R. Norman and Richard Gombrich
have written articles pointing out specific Pali suttas criticising various
Upani.sads and Braahma.nas.
