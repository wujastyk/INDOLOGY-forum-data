SARVANGI OF GOPALDAS
          "The Sarvangi  of Gopaldas; a  17th  century anthology of  Bhakti 
          literature" was published by Manohar in Delhi  in  1993.  What  I 
          assume is the same book, "The Sarvangi of  the Dadupanthi Rajab," 
          was  published  in  Leuven  by  the  Departement  Orientalistiek, 
          Katholieke  Universitet,  in  1978,  as   v.   4   in  Orientalia 
          Lovaniensia analecta.
