To the multiple receipients of Indology discussion group,

 I am currently engaged in researching my M.A. Thesis on "Dana/Daksina 
in the Mahabharata", specifically bks.12 & 13. At present I am trying to 
obtain as much information as possible on the date and historical 
context of these two books. I have read Hopkins' *The Great Epic of 
India*, and "The Bharata and The Great-Bharata", and have recently 
obtained a copy of Yardi's *The Mahabharata:It's genesis and growth*, 
but I am unaware of any other texts which deal with this issue at any 
length. I would be greatly indebted to anyone who could provide me with 
any other references or general advice on this topic. 
 Thank you in advance,
