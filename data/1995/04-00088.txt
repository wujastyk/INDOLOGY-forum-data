'Burning Glasses' in Ancient India?
You may look up references to the 'suuryakaanta' and 'candrakaanta' 
'maNi's.  The first one is supposed to emmit fire when in contact with 
the rays of the sun, and the second is supposed to exude some sort of 
liquid when touched by the moon-rays.  The 'suuryakaanta' may be a 
naturally formed lens used to start a fire.
