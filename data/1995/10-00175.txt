The point is to be able to do scholarly work in transliteration, and
also to have a standard for text exchange and archiving.  The CSX
standard is *not* primarily aimed at text representation, although it
can function in that capacity too, of course.
I don't understand.  There is no ANSI definition for South Asian scripts.
