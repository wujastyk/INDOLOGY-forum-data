Dominik,
in connection with your message on WEB pages updates I should like to 
mention that you can also access the OPAC of Goettingen University 
Library.

The WWW address is:

        http:/www.uni-goettingen.de/~sub/homepage.htm
        
or telnet to:

        opac.sub.uni-goettingen.de
        (alternative no.: 134.76.163.12)
        
        username: opc              for exit enter: stp
        
        (whenever ENTER is required, use ENTER, not RETURN!)
        

or by phone via modem:

        (Germany) (0)551 / 39-9911

        
Although the Tuebingen collection is by far larger, especially for the 
post-war period, in which Tuebingen has functioned as the federal 
Special Collections Library (Sondersammelgebietsbibliothek) for South 
Asia, Goettingen might also be of interest.

In theory, the Goettingen OPAC comprises ALL holdings, except for the 
period from 1945 to 1977. HOWEVER: the pre-1945 data were copied from 
the old folio catalogue by temporary staff untrained in Indian 
languages, and have not been checked against the books. Needless to 
add, there are a number of mistakes and inconsistencies. And another 
qualification: the old series (Bibliotheca Indica, Bombay SPS, ChSS 
Kashi SS, etc.) have only been partly converted.

Nevertheless, everybody is welcome to give it a try. I would be very 
interested to hear what you think of it.

Regards

Reinhold
