Indology Research desk
Hello,
	I am currently writing a proposal to make a research platform which
an indologist can use for the research and related activities. 
I would like to know from the list members  what all this piece of software 
should have and can optionally have. All suggestions and criticisms are most
welcome.
Thanks,
Vineet
