Adyar library is alive and well. Motilal has a bookstore near Luz, Mylapore.
There is also Jayalakshmi Bookstore in APparswamikoil st. near Sanskrit
college, Madras also near Luz. There is also Kuppuswami Research Inst.
library in the college. 

I will be very happy to help you when you are in Madras. Please feel free
