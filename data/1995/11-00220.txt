I am retransmitting this to Indology because I just got a message from 
Pipeline that it had been obstructed and lost.  Pardon if it actually got 
through and is therefore being reposted.


In response to Jonathan Silk's first enquiry, on Kali-puja, if he is 
interested in "descriptions" in the sense of those by an observer, they 
may perhaps be found in the following books. I have not examined them 
myself.  There are also a number of books which are "descriptions" of the 
cult of Kali in the sense of manuals of her worship.
