acquisitions  and a limitless pursuit of prosperity.  >From childhood an
Indian is brought up on the notion that austerity and a  contended  life
is  good.   and  also a certain other- worldliness is inculcated through
the tales a grandmother narrates, the discourses at the temple hall, and
through  moral  books.   The  American  temperament, on the contrary, is
pragmatic.

 INDIFFERENCE TO ETERNITY

The American has a robust indifference to eternity.  "Visit  the  church
on  a Sunday and listen to the sermon if you like but don't bother about
the future,"  he  seems  to  say.   Also,  "dead  yesterday  and  unborn
tomorrow,  why  fret  about  them if today be sweet?" - he seems to echo
Omar Khayyam's philosophy.  He works hard and  earnestly,  and  acquires
wealth,  and enjoys life.  He has no time to worry about the after-life;
he only takes the precaution to draw up a proper  will  and  trusts  the
Funeral Home around the corner to take care of the rest.  The Indian who
is not able to live on this basis wholeheartedly,  finds  himself  in  a
half-way  house;  he is unable to overcome the inherited complexes while
physically flourishing on the American soil.  One may hope that the next
generation  of  Indians (American-grown) will do better by accepting the
American climate spontaneously or in the alternative return to India  to
live a different life.
