History of Religions Congress (fwd)
David,
Thanks for the information about the Mexico City conference.  Sorry I 
won't be able to make it.  I also received just today the copy of the 
Kabir manuscript catalogue, which looks quite impressive.  Many thanks.
I haven't had a chance to thank you for all the work you did on the 
Bhakti Religion volume.  The final product looks quite impressive.  I 
hope it was worth all the work you went through to get it out.
All the best,
Mike
