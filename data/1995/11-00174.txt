Hello Echnaton,
You wrote on 25.11.95 about "Sanscrit Font":
Linguist Software - for example - provides TrueType and PS fonts for  
Macintosh and Windows/OS2 PCs (this is a commercial company, of  
course). I never used one of them so I can copy only the advertisement  
I have at hand.
They have a package called "LaserHindi Sanskrit": "TrueType(tm) and  
ATM-compatible Type-1 HindiSanskrit fonts. Keyboard Switcher assists  
typing consonants, conjuncts, and vowels. $99.95." It consists of a  
Devanagari set in both TT and Type-1. Some years (1992 or 93) ago I  
saw a printed specimen typeset with this Nagari. I must confess - at  
least in my opinion - it was not so elegant as the font for TeX  
created by F. Velthuis. So I voted for the last one.
Besides Nagari Linguist Software has also packages called  
"LaserGujarati", "LaserPanjabi", "LaserTamil", "TransIndic  
Transliterator" and as forthcoming "LaserSindhi".
Whoever of you Indology subscribers has used or uses one of these  
please let us know your experience(s) with them.
Perhaps, a look around public fileservers will do the same. Once I saw  
on Compu$erve's Foreign Language Forum a Mac Nagari font.
