1) This journal is open to all *bona fide* scholars in Tantric Studies in 
Sanskrit. Particular attention is paid to the Trika schools of Kashmir.
2) It is monitored for style and content by the Editor-in-Chief.
3) There is copyright but with automatic permission to publish anywhere else 
later on when the author wishes to do so. Our aim is to disseminate our 
work quickly.
4) We include unpublished articles, abstracts, and news (such as on 
published books, on papers, conferences, meetings, events, 
Ph.D. projects, etc.)
5) We plan to publish once a year a hard copy of all the contributions 
to this Journal. It will be distributed under request.
