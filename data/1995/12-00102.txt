Muslims, was the "PC" Card

These opinions are held by very large numbers of Hindus in India, and 
are readily expressed by them. Probably we all know that. I think the 
Hindu/Muslim conflict displays the same interplay between current 
genuine concerns and historical context that can be found in many 
cases of ethnic strife. Muslims DO have a much higher mean birth rate 
and Pakistan IS a threat and some Indian Muslims DO put their own 
loyalty in doubt. It is a reasonable question whether the historical 
context would be so important if these current concrete concerns were 
not present.
Whose being dismissive? Certainly not I! Perhaps these 
concerns appear so unmentionably primitive, that one can only talk 
about them in dismissive terms. Well, I don't think so. And isn't 
that tit-for-tat argumentation (Muslim poverty / Hindu poverty)?
The Czech case is interesting - currently there is a commission of 
historians sponsored by both the Czech and the German governments 
charged with the task of writing a definitive record of who did what 
to whom. It seems a laudable task, and maybe it resembles what JB 
Sharma was writing about. I don't see any possibility of doing 
anything like that with Indian Muslim historians - if there are any. 
So let's be realistic - if the kind of catastrophe that Sharma 
foresees is going to be avoided, another way has to be found.
Quite so. It wouldn't even be Hindu as we know it! 
Hinduism is diversity itself. A power capable of removing Muslims 
and others from India would be a totalitarian one which could not 
tolerate this kind of diversity. Most likely India would break apart. 
I don't agree with Mr. Tritsch either, IF that is what he said. 
Obviously history, even medieval history, is important for how 
political elites act and how they sell their ideas to their 
constituencies. WHETHER they can sell their ideas depends a lot on 
the current concrete concerns of their constituencies. Ask any 
politician, he'll tell you. There is an interplay - the history can 
often provide a framework of rationalisation for already present 
concerns. In particular, the history provides a guideline on WHO TO 
TRUST. That is a very important matter in any social entity, because 
it is central to the natural human idea of justice. At the moment, 
unfortunately, history is interpreted, rightly or wrongly,as telling 
the Hindu not to trust the Muslim.
