Is honey found in Arka trees?

I do not know the scientific name of this plant (arka) but it is found
quite commonly in south India. It has fleshy leaves, which when
plucked, cause a white milky liquid to flow from the stem. It is used
to worship Shiva and Ganapathi. BTW, Isn't it Ganesh Chaturthi today?
This plant's leaves are one of the twenty one varieties of leaves that
are liked by Ganesh. But I don't think honey is present in this
plant. It is not considered edible. It called JilleDu in Telugu. If
you want, I can try to find out the scientific name.
I remember the phrase `arka patram pujayAmi' in the Ekavimshati patra
puja which is offered to Ganapathi.  Also there is the following
shloka of Appyya DIkshitar (from his unmatta shatakam):
