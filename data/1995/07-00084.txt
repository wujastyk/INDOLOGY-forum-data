    BOOK REVIEW: THE "RIBHU GITA"

    Translated by Dr. H. Ramamoorthy, assisted by Master Nome
    Published by the Society of Abidance in Truth (SAT) 1995

---------------------------------------------------------------

Very seldom does a central text of an important religious
tradition appear "out of the blue," as in this case. The "Ribhu 
Gita", a consummate work of Advaita Vedanta, is now translated for
the first time into English from the Sanskrit. It is an ancient,
astonishing description of direct Nondual experience, and thus
a spiritual event of great importance--and not only for adherents
of Vedanta. Ribhu declares, in endless variety of narration, the 
central nondual experience of Advaita:

    "I am the Self, which is Brahman alone. I am solely a
    mass of pure Consciousness. I am the sole-existent,
    undivided Essence. I am Brahman alone.
    
    I am solely of the nature of Knowledge. I am of the
    nature that exists by itself. I am the sole-existent,
    complete Essence. I am Brahman alone.
    
    I am of the nature of Existence. I, indeed, am of the
    nature of beatitude. I am beyond meaning or absence of
    meaning. I am Brahman alone."
