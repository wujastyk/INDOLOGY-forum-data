I recently contacted the

Rinsen Book Co. Ltd.
P O Box: Sakyo No. 8,
Imadegawa-Kawabata,
Sakyo-Ku,
Kyoto 606, Japan.
Cable: Rinsen, Kyoto
FAX: 075-781-6168

hoping to get the little MW, but the leaflet they sent me didn't include
it.  They have other attractive items, though:

Apte, Practical Skt-Eng Dict:   Y 14,000
Das, Tibetan-English:           Y 8,500
Jaeschke, Tibetan-English:      Y 6,500
Chandra, Tibetan-Sanskrit:      Y 24,272
Childers, Pali:                 Y 12,000
Edgerton, BHS Gr. & Dict.       Y 22,000
Boehtlingk, Skt-Woert. Kuerzerer: Y 47,000
Schmidt, Nactraege zum SW:      Y 12,000

Does anyone know if Rinsen really does MW, and if so, how much it costs?
Or, Edeltraud, is it some other Japanese company?
