Dear Thread-Participants,

I am enjoying this thread immensely. I just wanted to point out to the
participants that a new newsgroup - sci.philosophy.natural (moderated) -
will deal with just these sorts of issues.

The goal of the group is to understand the co-development of science,
philosophy, theology, and mythology in all cultures. What has been called
here 'scientific translation' - with its limitations - is central to this
effort.

It is being voted on right now, and your participation is welcome. Ballots
are available by e-mail from the votetaker:

Sincerely,

Will
