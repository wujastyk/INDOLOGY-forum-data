Dear Raghavendra,

Thank you very much for these files, which provide a very useful set of
materials for anyone studying the Gita.  I have zipped up everything
with the name gita-materials.zip, and stored it on the INDOLOGY
supplementary gopher (cf. http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgadkw/indology.html)

Thanks again,

Dominik
