     From the outset, bureaucratic squabbling and charges of
corruption have plagues much of the expensive engineering work.

     With 27 tubewells supplied by the state water authority, the
project spends $350,000 (U.S.) a year to drain the site and lower
the water table. For another $1-million, the local team built
five spurs in the Indus River to divert the tumultuous water flow
away from the site.

     Although the water table now appears to be under control,
the lack of financial monitoring has led to suspicions of
government agencies overcharging each other.

     A recent public fund-raising campaign in Pakistan failed to
raise any money for the site, despite the fat that the 10-rupee
note bears the ancient city's image.

     With the site attracting 200 to 300 visitors a day in the
cooler winter months, UNESCO also urged the government to charge
tourists more than the current fee of 12 cents. In Egypt and Sri
Lanka, visitors pay up to $25 a day to see archaeological sites.

     Another money-generating plan called for a new canal to
carry unwanted water from the site to nearby farmlands, where it
could irrigate as much as 15,000 hectares. But farmers refused to
pay for their share of the water. "They said somehow they were
doing us a favour by accepting our water," Mr. Shamsi said.
