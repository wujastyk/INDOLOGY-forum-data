Dear Sir
If you do not intend to offend anybody, why send such nonsens and such
offending and tasteless jokes on a serious network such as this?

I, for one find this distasteful and are seriously considering leaving the
network. If our work as indologists and social scientists are to be kept at
this level then I am not interested.

	I'm going to make some wild connections. Please bear with me :)
my contention: 'deul' is very likely a derivation from root 'dev'.

here's why:
	In telugu, a temple is called 'devAlayam' (deva+Alayam) abode of gods.
The other corrupt (if I may) and/or shortened forms are:
	dEvalam, dEvaLi etc. Of these dEvalam is quite popular in areas 
boardering tamilNadu, and probably is used by tamils as well.
	'duel' looks like another such derivation related to 'dev'.
Comments are welcome.
