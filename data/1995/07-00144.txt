Thank you.
 I would just like to thank all of those individuals on the Indology 
discussion group who so kindly sent me their thoughts on the question of 
dating Heesterman's 'axial-breakthrough' - thanks to your advice, I feel 
that I am now in a position to tackle the theories of Heesterman with 
some confidence.
                            Thanks again,
                                          Steven Columbus.
