Was it the point of Kalyanraman's note? From his name he does not appear 
to be a north Indian revisionist and probably he is also a Tamil speaker 
like you.

> me that Hindu elites have a vested interest in this. I know for sure
Does this sentence not expose you as having equally vested interest in 
contradicting any other hypothesis out of the way specially since you 
admitted that you do not know Sanskrit yourself?

Is this the only basis of your argument? History has shown that some time 
a number of scholors can be wrong. You know even a scholors as reputed as 
Margaret Meade or  Cyrill Burt have been proved to have been dishonest 
and biased.
I am no scholor of Indus script but what I have read seems to point out that 
it is still not completely deciphered.
