upaadhmaaniiya and jihvaamuuliiya
While reading with a friend I recently noticed the apparently consistent use of
a symbol for the upaadhmaaniiya (the jihvaamuuliiya did not appear at all) 
in an early Nepalese palm-leaf manuscript. 
Can anybody tell me about the use in manuscripts of the upaadhmaaniiya and the
jihvaamuuliiya?  They are commonly used in Kashmirian manuscripts even of
non-Vedic texts and I imagine that they are to be found in manuscripts of Vedic
texts outside Kashmir; but do they commonly occur in other contexts than these?
