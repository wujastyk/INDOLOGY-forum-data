J D Smith's files copied
Further to John Smith's recent announcement of his emended texts of the
Mahabharata and Ramayana, text utilities and fonts, I have now mirrored
his files at the gopher site:
gopher-server.bcc.ac.uk
under
... /Anonymous FTP area/users/ucgadkw/jd-smith
or
by anonymous ftp from ftp.bcc.ac.uk:/pub/users/ucgadkw/jd-smith
