Sugandha Johar said:
Dear Sugandha (appropriate name!),
Mallige is Jasminum sambac (L.) Ait., known in English as "Arabian
Jasmine"  It is sometimes also called "Tuscan jasmine" or "Sambac
jasmine".  The New Royal Horticultural Society Dictionary Index of
Garden Plants (London, 1994) says of this plant that it "may originate
in India".  The Sanskrit name is Mallikaa, although there are many, many
synonyms for this popular plant.  It is mentioned in the
Abhidhaanama~njarii,  Bhaavaprakaa"sa, Raajanigha.n.tu,
Kaiyadevaanigha.n.tu, etc.
