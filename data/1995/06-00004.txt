ANNOUNCEMENT
 
The General Editors and Technical Editor of the Journal of Buddhist
Ethics will be presenting a Special Topics Forum at the forthcoming
Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Religion, to be held in
Philadelphia in November 1995. The session is scheduled for
Saturday, November 18th, 3:45-6:15 p.m.
 
Electronic Publication: Academic Journals in Religious Studies
 
Presiding: Charles S. Prebish, Pennsylvania State University
Presenter: Wayne R. Husted, Pennsylvania State University
Presenter: Damien Keown, Goldsmiths College (University of London)
 
Description: The use of emerging technologies for teaching and
research in Religious Studies is a topic that is rapidly gaining
interest among scholars. In particular, electronic publication via
the Internet has received much recent attention. While interest in
academic publication in Religious Studies is growing, the use
actually made of this technology is currently minimal. This may
well be in part due to many scholars' unfamiliarity with the
medium. Consequently, this Special Topics Firum will introduce
scholars to the specifics of creating scholarly, electronic
journals in Religious Studies, focusing on the Journal of Buddhist
Ethics, the first such journal in the field. The session will
emphasize not only the technologies involved, but also the
processes by which an editorial board can be constructed,
manuscripts solicited, and a subscriber base established. The
presenters and presiding member of this experimental session
represent the primary editorial staff of the Journal of Buddhist
Ethics.
