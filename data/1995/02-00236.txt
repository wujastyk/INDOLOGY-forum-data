I don't know whether this topic is proper for this group. I've been told 
that there is a sufficient lack of interest on topics such as these among 
the subscribers of this list, but since I have no other sources to turn 
to,, I will ask my question here.

I've recently read a text called "The Ethnology of Ancient Bharata" by 
Ram Chandra Jain, in which the authour proposes that the history of the 
Aryan migration into India and the events which took place afterward, 
including the characters, ie. Varun, Mitr, Indr, etc, were mythologized.

How widely accepted is this view?

Thanks.
