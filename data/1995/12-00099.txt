But if I recall correctly, the relevant criterion of the person who 
initially posed the question about the value of Prof. OFlaherty's 
translation was that literal translation from the point of view of an 
expert.  I don't recall that person asking about the value of "popuplar" 
translation or about the sense of flow or any such matter to which the 
discussion following Witzel's comments have turned to. The initial 
request seems to have been forgotten and everyone has since taken a 
defensive position on Prof. Oflaherty's translation.  Isn't it our job as 
scholars to be pointing out such problems so that they can be worked out 
and corrected in future work?  
It is a different thing to ask what the value and usefulness is of this 
translation for introductory classes.

Ditto on this point.  Sounding cool is not an excuse for being wrong.

Ditto.  A translation, a difficult process, can not sacrifice correctness 
for the sake of coolness.

This is indeed a valid point of discussion.  Maybe this group should put 
it's colletive effort into a discussion and conversation on the issue of 
translation, which everyone seems to have been indirectly addressing 
after Witzel's comments as a sort of defense of Prof. OFlaherty's 
translation.
