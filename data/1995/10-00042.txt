Overseas loans
This is in response to a query by Allen Thrasher regarding US libraries 
loaning overseas.
The University of Washington Libraries, Seattle which owns an important 
collection of South Asian materials does, through its Resource Sharing 
Program, loan material from its circulating collections to 
libraries overseas.  In addition to the usual fees, all material is 
shipped airmail which adds to the costs.
Our catalog is available through the South Asia Gopher
columbianet.columbia.edu  (Clioplus etc.)
