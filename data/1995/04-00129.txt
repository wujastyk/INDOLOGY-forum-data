Dear Sid,
I imagine lots of people would be interested--after all, fonts 
are a common topic of inquiry and discussion on INDOLOGY.
In any case, if you at least send comments to me, I'll incorporate them 
into the Fonts list that we maintain as part of the ILM (Inventory of 
Language Materials) project, on the South Asia Gopher.
Let me take this opportunity to remind everybody that we also maintain 
annotated lists of in-print language teaching materials for a number of 
South Asian languages, a list of available language study programs, etc.  
I can send any of these to anyone as an email message on request, or can 
send info about how to reach this material on the Gopher.
So Sid, your comments will be a great help for those--including me--who 
are eager to hear more about these new fonts. 
Wishing everybody a good summer,
Fran Pritchett
