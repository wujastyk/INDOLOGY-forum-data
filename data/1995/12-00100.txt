WEB pages updates
Dear Reinhold,
Thank you for the Web and telnet pointers for the Goettingen University
Library.  I have now added these to the INDOLOGY web page /libraries.
I have also taken the opportunity to reoganize the libraries page to
make it clearer, as well as adding a link to the Karlsruhe service for
searching severa German catalogues from a single menu.
Best wishes,
Dominik
