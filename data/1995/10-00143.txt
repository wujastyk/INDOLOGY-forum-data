Bookstores in Madras?
There is a terrific bookstore called //Giggles// which is nextdoor to the 
Connemara Hotel on the main drag in Madras. If they don't carry what you 
want, they will get it for you in a couple of hours. Sarah LeVine.
I haven't been to Madras in years, but as I recall, Giggles was actually IN
the Connemara Hotel. The University of Madras also has a bookstore that sells
all of their own publications.
