SUBSCRIPTION INFORMATION
FOR
SOUTH ASIA RESEARCH

Dear Friends and Colleagues,

The latest issue of SOUTH ASIA RESEARCH (Vol. 15 No 1) is available now.  
This announcement provides information about the contents of this issue and 
how to subscribe to the journal.

SOUTH ASIA RESEARCH is an interdisciplinary journal that is concerned with 
the history, ecology, anthropology, architecture, languages, literatures, 
legal systems, religions and visual arts of South Asia (the Indian 
subcontinent). It was established at the School for Oriental and African 
Studies in London in 1980 and is published twice a year, in May and November. 
The primary aim is to give rapid access to current research work, and on 
occasion the journal publishes the work of promising research students as 
well as established scholars.  Special issues have also been devoted to 
particular conferences and workshops in the past.  In addition to four 
articles per issue, plus conference reports and book reviews, the journal 
aims to publish interpretive essays that discuss in a more general manner the 
issues and problems that arise from research on South Asia.
