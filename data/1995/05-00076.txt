Michael Witzel,  Looking for the Heavenly Casket
ABSTRACT: Throughout Vedic literature, from the Rgveda to the Brhadaranyaka
Upanisad, reference is occasionally made to a "heavenly  casket" (divya
kosa), from which water is poured down towards earth. Several attempts
have been made to locate this vessel in the sky. In the present article
the relevant materials are presented and a new solution is proposed which
combines, according to the well tested philological approach,
mythological facts with a keen observation of nature.
