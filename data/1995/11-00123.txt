a question on the Mahabharata
	Currently I am reading the Shakuntala story from the Mahabharata 
with my students.  In verses 1.68.2 and 1.68.58, we are told that the 
gestation period for Bharata was three years.  NiilakaNTha's commentary 
does not explain this, nor does Van Buitenan.  Does anyone know the 
significance of "three years"?
	All the best,
