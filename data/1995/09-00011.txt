Satyajit Ray books (was: Learning Bengali)
Krishna Padmasola wrote: 
Have any of these, incidentally, been translated? I know that a few Feluda
stories were translated into English & published by Penguin India, but I
never heard of any other Ray-literature (except for his writings on film,
which are not really "literature") being or having been translated.
