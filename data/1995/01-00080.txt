Subject: I do not quite agree with Dr. Wujastyk
Message-ID: <161227018191.23782.1718921193311813500.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

There aren't many things that will draw me out of the lurkers shadows, but
this latest posting of Mr. Borowski has lured me out.

It is obvious, to anyone who can read that Mr. Borowski and Mr. Wujastyk
are Poles apart on these issues, and I for one look forward to further
elucidation.

Please.
