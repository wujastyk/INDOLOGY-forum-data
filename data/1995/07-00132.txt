The sorting of Devanagari text into dictionary order is a subject I had to 
address in work I have done on creating catalogues of Hindi manuscripts.

I also translated the text into an artificial third party transliteration 
where I found that each 'letter' in the sort needed to represent three 
aspects of the letter, the sort sequences of: its base value, initial vowel 
or consonant, a mAtrA value and a nasality value. Using these values for 
each aksara in the Devanagari a sort string can be generated which can be 
sorted normally.

I wrote a Turbo Pascal utility program that sorts Hindi text in Devanagari 
(Typed in a Devanagari font called MaharastriMedium from BrahmiType) into 
dictionary order. If anyone else happens to use this font and wants to sort 
Hindi (and *maybe* it would work for Sanskrit) text I'd be happy to make the 
utility available to them.

However, it is clear that sorting Sanskrit may present more difficulties, as 
mentioned by Gerard Huet, than sorting Hindi.

Also as we all seem to use different Devanagari fonts (and encodings) and 
different Roman transliteration font encodings it seems that the problem of 
how to sort Devanagari will be around for a long time!
