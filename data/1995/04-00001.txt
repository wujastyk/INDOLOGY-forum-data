Sankara etexts
Prof. Roly Sussex's request for information on Sanskrit concordances was
forwarded to Indology.  I've found the following to be very useful:
D'Sa, Francis X.  Word Index to Sankara's Gitabhasya.  Pune, India: The
Institute for the Study of Religion.  ISBN 0-89012-052-8
Mahadevan, T. M. P.  Word Index to the Brahma-Sutra-Bhasya of Sankara.  2
parts.  Madras: University of Madras, 1971, 1973.
