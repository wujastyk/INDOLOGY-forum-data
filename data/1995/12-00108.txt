In this statement, as well as in his remarks on Witzel's remarks, R. Korman
seems to presuppose that the relevant criterion applied by Witzel was
whether the translation is literal or not. To me, that seems off the mark. 
The "sense of flow", in my opinion, was more distinct in W's translation
than in O's, for it matched the flow of the Vedic original more closely. To
produce a translation with "some sense of flow" is just not enough - the
"flow" would have to be an approximation, rendering etc. of the flow in the
source-language - in other words, one would have to take into account the
intentionality/functionality of the source-text more than the
"easy-goingness" in the target language. Also, "sensibly" very obviously was
not meant to be a sentence in the translation, but an elliptical phrasing
intended precisely to catch the "flow" (hasty, stammering) of the original. 
Forgive my bluntness, but this is nonsense. When one uses a vocative, one
does so in order to address somebody - that's the intention of the speaker,
and that is the function of the text. When the translation misses out this
function, it's a bad translation. Certainly, "you were my man" and "oh man"
are presupposing different intentions and meaning different things, no? 
But whether it sounds like something the actual speaker in the context of
the text might have said is an entirely different issue. 
Acceptable to whom? To somebody who wishes to read ancient Indian text
up-dated into easily readable present-day American English, with lots of
punch and cool flows?
Because one interprets a passage at describing a state of affairs - or an
emotional state - does not justify the need to actually insert a description
of that state of affairs into the translation. 
In the example quoted, the author mentions that the boy will let roll down
tears. This is something which is not necessarily done with sobbing,
therefore, the omission of "sobbing" might have been intended/marked in the
original, and there is absolutely no justification to insert it in the
translation. 
On the whole, I would like to have Robin Kornman's opinion on what other
criteria, apart from "readability", a good translation should meet, and how
exactly this "readability" is to be understood. So far, I can see little
more in it than an excess in down-grading the beauty and poetic complexity
of a text to the not necessarily ugly, but context-unfit language of a
comic-book or a contemporary American airplane-novel.
