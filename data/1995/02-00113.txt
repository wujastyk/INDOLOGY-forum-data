Search for address
Can anyone help me find the address of Patrick Olivelle, the editor of 
medieval texts on renunciation and author of several articles on 
renunciation and the asrama institution, etc. In 1993 he seemed to be at 
Indiana University, Bloomington, but a search in the IUB Gopher gives no 
result.
