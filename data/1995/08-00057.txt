Dear Mr. McDermott
The reference of Samghabhadra is: Taisho XXIX 1562 xliii p. 588c, line 9-15.
I am sorry, I could not find the "suutra" referred by Samghabhadra.  Anyway, I
could not find any relevant reference in the Chinese commentaries, by Puguang 
and by Fabao, Taisho XLI 1821 xviii p. 279b line 3 sq., and Taisho XLI 1822 
xviii p. 680a line 4 sq.; and there is nothing either in the Dictionary of 
Buddhist Proper Names of AKANUMA Chizen, s.v. Kumaara Kassapa.  We should 
perhaps search in some aberrant traditions of Aagama, or Jaataka or Vinaya... 
(probably in Chinese).
I hope that this can be of some help for you...
Best wishes.
