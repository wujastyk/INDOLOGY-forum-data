I agree
May I politely suggest that Sid Harth has a point? It may be difficult to
strike a proper balance between a strictly academic debate between
specialists on the one hand, and an all-out
got-my-finger-in-your-eye-you-idiot kind of political debate, but a certain
liberalism may not be out of the way. If we were to freeze out everybody
who simply enjoys listening in and ask the occasional question, I feel we
would do ourselves and all that "riff-raff" out there in cyberspace a
disservice. If somebody gets way out of line, a few firm emails usually
does the trick. In extreme cases, they can be removed from the list.
