Personal Papers of F. Max Muller
As far as I remember the personal papers and some Indian MSS of Max 
Mueller had been sold/given to the (Imperial) University of Tokyo where
they perished in the Kanto fire following the big earthquake of 1923. However, rotographs of 
some MSS were made and they should still be at Oxford (probably in the 
Bodleian Libr.) 
Our colleagues in Japan will be able to find out more. It probably is best 
to ask someone at the Toyo Bunko (Library) .
