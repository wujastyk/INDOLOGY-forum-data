I am no scholar of Julius Lipner's heights (recently appointed Director 
of Hinduja Research Centre on Ancient India at Cambridge) but I could add 
the following items, papers I have worked on on the Mimamsa doctrine of 
apaurusheya (critically against Nyaya and Vedanta watering down of the genuinely 'authorless' 
aspect. I find nothing incoherent, by the way, in this theory and it is 
consistent with Mimamsa commitment to the autonomous efficacy of rituals 
and mantras. (Diacritcs ellided).
