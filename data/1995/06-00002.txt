lotusses, lac, ityaadi
Dear colleagues and friends,
Two questions: the first is another of these queries for the etymology 
specialists, the second leads back to the discussion re lotusses and the 
moon, which bloomed open on the internet a while ago.
1. Does anybody on the list have an opinion about the etymology of the 
following Braj Bhasha/Hindi words:
MAHAAVARA (red lac with which the feet are dyed; is it as straightforward as 
it seems (mahaa+vara), and has anybody come across an attestation in that 
meaning?)
LAHAMGAA (women's skirt; related to *langapatta?)
NAKABESARI (nosering; *nakka +?)
the dance terms "TIRAPA" (tri+?) and "SULAPA"?
2. Is the blue lotus flower called vanaja (Skt)/ vanajaati (Braj) a day or 
night lotus?
Any suggestions are much appreciated.
