Flowers in ancient Tamil
                Flowers in Ancient Tamil literature
               ------------------------------------
Ancient Tamil literature is called Sangam poetry (100 BC to 250 AD).
The sangam poetry is divided into two anthologies 1) eTTut tokai
(eight collections) 2) pattup pATTu (Ten songs)
In the "pattup pATTu", there is a work called Kurinjip pATTu.
The heroine and her friend gather all kinds of flowers
and places them on a rock. In that section of Kurinjip pATTu,
99 flowers with pure Tamil names are mentioned without a break.

U. V. Swaminathaiyar (1855-1942) rediscovered the Sangam classics from
neglected and decaying palm-leaf manuscripts in the last part of
19th century. These Sangam poems establish Tamil as one of the two
classical languages of India. For all Indian languages other than
Tamil, the metalanguage is Sanskrit. But Tamil and especially in its
oldest extant literature has its own themes and does not borrow too much.
On the importance of UVS work, A. K. Ramanujan wrote a paper in 
Carla Borden, Contemporary Indian tradition, Smithsonian, 1989. See 
A. K. Ramanujan's translations a) The interior landscape b) Poems of 
Love and war, Columbia university. George Hart a) Poems of ancient tamil, 
Berkeley b) Poets of tamil anthologies, Princeton. Thomas Malten, Index of
Tamil sangam literature. Also the works of J. R. Marr.
