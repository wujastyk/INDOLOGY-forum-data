I forwarded the request for an article by Kaviraj on Aurobindo to my 
colleague here Klaus Klostermaier, who is not yet on indology.  Here's 
his response.  He can be reached at kklostr at bldgarts.lan1.umanitoba.ca.

Bob, 
     I ckecked all I have by Gopinath Kaviraj and could not find anything on 
Aurobindo. However, there are three parts of his sadhudarsan evam satprasang 
ofwhich I have only the third. These volumes contain brief articles on saints 
and sages (some of them well-known, others little known) and it is possible 
that the first two parts contain an article on Aurobindo. The articles are 
fairly short.

     I have not been able as yet to get into the Indology internet list. If 
you have time when you are here I would appreciate your help to get the con-
nection going.
     Greetings

                Klaus

Klaus,
I thought you might be able to answer this question.  If you are already 
on the indology list, please let me know, and I'll know it's unnecessary 
to forward postings there to you.

To members of Indology:  One of our patrons at the U. of Chicago library has
information that Gopinath Kaviraj has written something on Sri Aurobindo. 
This might be an article or something in one of Kaviraj's philosophical
works.  Does anyone have any information on any such writing by Kaviraj?  
Thanks for any info you can supply.  Bill Alspaugh, U. of Chicago South Asia
Collection.
