Dravidians of Bharat vs Branch Dravidians
Thanks Richard, some students of mine had done a class paper after the 
incident and related the "origins" of the name Davidian in this way. 
Isn;'t David in any case a Hebraic name? I never thought of relating 
Branch to anything more than, say, Branch as in Division of IRS or INS. 
Australians don't know how to pronounce Waco so we kept hearing "whacko", 
though I doubt if there are related. Cheers
