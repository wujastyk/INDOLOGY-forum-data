NYAGRODHA
          The  Nyagrodha=Banyan=Ficus  bengalensis  grows   on   buildings, 
          rooting even  in  very  small cracks,  in  the crotches of  other 
          trees, and similar elevated sites.  It seems to  take practically 
          no  soil  to  get going.  In addition as mentioned it  sends down 
          aerial roots which if  not  cut  or  as  is  more usual eaten  by 
          foraging livestock turn  into further trunks (thus the  motto  of 
          the Asiatic Society of  Bengal, Quot  rami  tot arbores, As  many 
          trees as roots).  So  in two ways it can be said as  a species to 
          "grow downwards" in a literal way.
