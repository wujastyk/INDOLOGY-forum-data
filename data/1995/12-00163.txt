Sanskrit Manuscript on the net
I have made available on the INDOLOGY web page
(http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgadkw/indology.html) scanned images of 
a Sanskrit manuscript of the Isa Upanisad.  I would welcome feedback.
I have also added J D Smith's new Web page to the "general" page, as well
as adding some new entries to the library page: the Gabriel service gives
easy access to many European national libraries, and I have added Goettingen
library.
Enjoy! (Or, as was written on one of the Wellcome ratisastra MSS: "injoy!")
