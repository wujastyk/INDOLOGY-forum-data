Those interested in H.H.Wilson's GLOSSARY OF JUDICIAL AND REVENUE TERMS, 1855, 
etc., may wish to know of the following:

Wilson, H. H.  A Glossary of Judicial and Revenue Terms and of Useful Words 
Occurring in Official Documents Relating to the Administration of the Government
of British India.  Case-noted, enlarged ed.  Ed. A. C. Ganguli and N. D. Basu.  
Calcutta:  Eastern Law House, 1940.

This is a much expanded edition, and to my mind much more useful on a variety of
topics.  To my knowledge it was never reprinted.  It is, therefore, 
correspondingly more difficult to locate.
