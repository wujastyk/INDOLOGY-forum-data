dvng (Another question re: (La)TeX)
Anothe question regarding (La)TeX.
I wonder whether dvng program has been updated so that it can be used 
with LaTeX2e.  When I first tried to use it with the new LaTeX, I found 
one or some of commands used in the preprocessed document are no longer 
valid, even in its compatible mode.
I tried to find a workaround for this problem.  But it turned out to be 
very difficult for a casual user of TeX like me.  I would much appreciate 
if somebody acknowledges me the way to use that beautiful Devanagari font 
in a document compiled with LaTeX2e.
