Meaning of Panini, also "saakalya
	I suppose there is a connection between Shaakalya and the place 
name Shaakala or Sakala (Saagala in Pali: cf. Milindapanha).  However, 
there is also evidence in the Aitareya AaraNyaka and texts like the 
BrihadaaraNyaka Upanishad of the Shaakalyas residing in the eastern 
region of Videha and Magadha.
