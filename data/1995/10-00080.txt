Etymology of kSatriya
Etymology of kSatriya
I found an interesting lexeme in MarAThI.
kSetrI fr. kSatriya Skt. = the second of the four great classes of the 
Hindu people or an individual of it; a peasant, cultivator, farmer.
This suggests re-visiting the traditional morpheme: kSatr = military 
prowess (attested early in RV applied to the power of VaruNa-Mitra and 
Indra). ViSNurAm Apte adds 
a question mark as to the root: kSi? and remarks: "members of military in 
the earliest times as represented by the Vedic hymns were generally called 
rAjanya, not kSatriya;
afterwards, when the difference between brahman and 
kSatra or the priestly and civil authorities became more distinct, 
applied to the second or reigning or 
military caste in VS, AV, TS etc... " Raghuvamsa (ii,53) adds another root: 
trai, fancifully: kshatAt tra i.e., a preserver from injury.
But, see the root: kSi = to abide, reside (a secret residence) (RV); this 
root explains: kSetra = landed property (RV, AV ii,8,5, VS xvi,18)
The possible semantic conflicts: field X power, could be resolved by the 
PrAkr: khet, khelar (PunjAbI) = kSetra = agricultural field and assigning 
the early meaning of peasant to kSetrI. cf.
khettaM (Pali) = landed property, a cultivated field (Dhammapadam. 64); 
but, moriya khattiya = maurya princes (MahAwanso. 21).
The cognate semantics in Kannada and Tamil/MalayALam are: kesaRu and cERu
respectively meaning: mud, mire sluch, loam (cf. katirmUkkAral kIZHccER 
RoLippa: puRanA, 249); cERATu-tal = to make a field slushy for sowing paddy 
(Tamil).
It is, therefore, reasonable to propose that the early meaning of kSatr 
was linked, not to power but to agriculture.
