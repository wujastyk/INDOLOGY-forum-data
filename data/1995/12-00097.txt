Is not the revival and implementation of Shari'a laws, and thus the 
Islamicization of the state infofar as possible, a central concern of the 
Islamic radicalism that has spread through the Muslim world of late?

this trend of thought.  Have any studies been done of the influence of 
Islamic radicalism in India?
