Tamil Short Story
i'm currently elaborating a PhD thesis on the short stories of the Tamil
author Maun_i (Mowni, S. MaNi) (1907-1985) who eminently contributed to the
developement of this genre with unique features concerning form and content.
The majority of his prose was published first in "MaNikkoTi" an influential
literary magazine in 1930s Tamilnadu.
Checking out the commonly known bibliographic sources i just came across
four single translations i.e.
Born of Death (cAvil piRanta ciruSTi) in: Adil Jussawalla, New Writing in
India, Penguin Books, 1974, p.217-230.
A loss of Identity (tavaRu), transl. by Albert Franklin, in: Ka Naa Subramanyam,
Tamil Short Stories, New Delhi: Vikas, 1980, p.57-63.
Transformations (mARutal), in: Kennedy, Richard Stanton, Public Voices,
Private Voices: Manikkoti, Nationalism and the Developement of the Tamil
Short Story, 1914-1947, unpubl. diss. Berkeley: University of California,
1980, p.216-221.
Mother (kuTumpattEr), transl. by M.S. Ramaswami, in: Indian Literature XXIV,
No.1, 1981, New Delhi: Sahitya Akademi, p.55-62.
Since only a part of published Tamil/Indian short story anthologies and
magazines in translation have yet been accessable to me, i wonder if there
are any more? Any additional references regarding Mowni translations would be a
great help!
To continue my research i go to Pondicherry within the next few months. Can
anybody suggest libraries in Tamilnadu stocking literary magazines (in
particular "MaNikkoTi")?
