Prof. Stampe makes a valid argument that ru- prefix is 
integral to Munda etyma. His impressive repertoire of 
Munda forms is indeed food for deeper linguistic 
thought and further analyses.

Is it possible that the Korku rum = to husk is derived 
from Munda? [cf. Telugu rubbu = to grind; Tamil 
uru(TTu) = to roll]. What are the Munda words meaning 
'to husk' or 'to grind'?

Semant. ru(ng) kug = husked rice. 

Are there other words for unhusked rice or paddy 
(seeds) or rice in the stalk, like vrIhi [*var(i)ci 
paddy (DED 178, 42306); Koraput Munda a-rig 'panicum 
miliare; Kherwarian *iRi 'panicum crus-galli'; Tamil 
ari 'rice, paddy'; also, a bundle of corn, a heap of 
grain before the straw is separated from it; vari 
'rice in the stalk, paddy' [cf. also Tamil vari = tax; 
Marathi virA = cess on persons possessing rent-free 
lands; Tamil virai = seed of plants; Telugu virALamu 
tax or impost]; Parji verci 'paddy'? But, cf. Tamil 
arici any kind of grain, but especially rice freed 
from chaff. Oriya aruwA = rice cleaned from unboiled 
paddy.

It should be noted that Zide's *ru-kug is a 
hypothetical construction or a proto-form.

I am extremely grateful to Prof. Stampe for the vivid 
enlightenment on Munda forms; certainly, I have to 
learn a lot more, for e.g. did Munda proto-forms (of 
particularly economic terms) stay totally excluded 
from socio-economic exchanges with, say, Oriya and/or 
Maithili?

Kalyanaraman.
