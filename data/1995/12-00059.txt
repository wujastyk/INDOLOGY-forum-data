I want to agree with Ms Rosser.  

In between the old left usage of the phrase *political correctness* and 
recent new right's usage there was a new left usage that was essentially
a joke about people who took their politics and themselves a bit too
seriously.  And then the right came along with its quaint epithetical
usage of PC as a designation for any language or politics that they didn't
like.

I can seldom make serious sense out of the term as anything but a name
to call objections to intentions that someone on the right wants to lable
a language issue rather than face as the social issue being referred to.

Think about this as you encounter the term.
