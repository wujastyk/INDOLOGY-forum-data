If you have access to Usenet, you might post this request on 
soc.culture.indian.gujarati as well.  If you don't I would be glad if you 
wish to attempt to do so for you, and forward responses.  So far I have 
had bad luck with the software my institution provides for dealing with 
transmitting or responding to Usenet, but I think I have it largely 
figured out now, and the challenge would be interesting.

Merry Christmas to all,
