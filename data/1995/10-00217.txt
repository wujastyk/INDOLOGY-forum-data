a Vedic reference to Siva
An undocumented eText[http://www.utexas.edu/students/amso/ror/hindu-d.html]
cites this passage as from a Vedic hymn to Siva:
"We invoke with obeisance, the ruddy of the sky, with spiral braided hair,
a brilliant form. Far be thy cow slaying and man slaying weapon."
Off hand, can anyone supply chapter and verse?
Thanks,
Michael Rabe
