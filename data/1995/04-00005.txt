Cracow Indological Series -wrong address
Sorry for the mistake I made in the p-mail address of
Institute of Oriental Philology in Krakow,
the correct one is: iforien at vela.filg.uj.edu.pl
If someone is able to remove my original message please do it, inform 
me, and I will write it once again without mistakes.
