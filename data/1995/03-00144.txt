Tim, your friend might try:

O'Neil, L. Thomas.  _Maya in Sankara_.  South Asia Books, 1980.

This book has sections on "Maya in the Early Tradition," "Samvrti 
Doctrine from Nagarjuna through Gaudapada," and "Samvrti (Maya) in 
Sankara."  It should be intelligible to a smart undergrad.

Also:

Arapura, J. G.  "Maya and the Discourse about Brahman."  In _The Problem 
of Two Truths in Buddhism and Vedanta_, ed. by M. Sprung.  Reidel, 1973.

Potter, Karl H.  _Advaita Vedanta up to Samkara and His Pupils_.  
Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, vol. 3.  Motilal Banarsidass, 1981.

Deutsch, Eliot.  _Advaita Vedanta: A Philosophical Reconstruction_.  
Honolulu: East-West Center Press, 1969.
