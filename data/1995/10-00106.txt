Etymology of puujaa

If puujaa originally refers to worship, the Dravidian etymology from the 
root puucu 'to smear' is quite acceptable. We must remember that among the 
oldest objects of worship in South Asia are the sacred trees, and 
smearing the tree trunks with red-coloured powders and oils was an 
integral part of the early tree cult (cf. e.g. J. Auboyer, Daily life in 
ancient India, 1961, page 154). The Rgvedic sense 'to honour' may 
be due to a secondary widening of the meaning.  ---
