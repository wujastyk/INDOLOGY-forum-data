Solar genealogy (Re: Dr. P. Claus' query)
"When castes grow in power, they claim descent from Moon, Sun etc.,
Colin Mackenzie manuscripts (late 18th century) of Land Lords/Zamindars
show that trend. Four volumes were published in 1981 (Dept. of
Archaeology,
Madras.)"
What are these four volumes?  More information, please.
