Though this would not make any substantial difference to his query, the 
following slight correction to the above assertion may be useful.. 'Paatri' 
is not merely used to non-brahmin priests, but also to refer to the brahmin 
who performs a certain function:  one who carries the idol on his head 
during the yearly  temple festivals in Dakshina Kannada (South Kanara) dt. 
Similarly, the word 'Pujari' is in use to all the temple (and /or the 
'sAnas' of bhUtas) priests including brahmin and non-brahmin ones. Perhaps 
this usage is more in vogue in Kannada of D.K., and Tulu influenced by 
Kannada, rather than in Tulu itself.  'Pujari', by the way is also used as 
an epithet  to refer to a caste that is equivalen of Elava community of 
Kerala. Certain section or sub-community of this caste has a certain 
function in butasAnas (the equivalent of temples for a sort of Spirits - a 
form of  'religious' practice specific to D.K.).
