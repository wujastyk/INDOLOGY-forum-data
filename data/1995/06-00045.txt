Lars Martin Fosse enquired about this book. Our library has it. It was
published in India, and is probably still in print from Manohar
publishers. Any good Indian book importer should be able to get you a
copy. Or you could contact a book exporter such as Vedams Books. (Try
sending email to their proprietor, Mr. Achal Madhavan, at this email
address:  madhavan at vedamdel.uunet.in   They accept orders by email and
respond quickly).   Hope this helps.   David Magier
