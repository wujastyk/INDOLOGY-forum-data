ftp/Web rearrangements
I have rearranged the files in the INDOLOGY supplementary gopher/ftp/web
site (ftp.bcc.ac.uk:/pub/users/ucgadkw/indology).
All the files were formerly in a single directory.  I have now 
tidied them into two sub-directories, "software" and "texts".  The
former contains fonts and other tools for text processing, while "texts"
contains transcriptions of Indic texts.
I have also added some readme files and renamed several of the files,
hoping to make the contents of the archive clearer.
