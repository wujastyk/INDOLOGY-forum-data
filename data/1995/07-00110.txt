Could someone provide me with the name, address, (phone and fax if
you have it) and distributor (ideally) of the
COMPACT edition of Monier-Williams' Sanskrit-English Dictionary?
Thanks in advance

The Minjoksa Publishing Company, Chong Ko-Ku,
Chung Jin-Dong 208-1
P.O.Box 1560
Seoul, Korea
published a compact edition of the Sanskrit-English
Dictionary. I have not seen a copy.  I tried to order
several copies last year for several of my students,
but encountered some difficulty because they did not
spell out their terms.  Here is their fax
(02) 739-7565.  Good luck. Edeltraud.

The Japanese have a beautiful edition which is twice
the price of the Korean. But I do not have the Japanese
address here in my office.
