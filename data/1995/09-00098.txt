Send the following two lines to listserv at ulkyvm.louisville.edu:
sub buddha-l Jim Hartzell
set buddha-l index
The index setting results in your getting a daily message with a
list of all the messages distributed to buddha-l subscribers during
the past twenty-four hours. Each message listed has an index number,
which can be used to order that particular message. The instructions
for ordering specific messages are given in the daily message that you
receive. An alternative option is digests (set buddha-l digests),
which results in your receiving all the postings of a twenty-four hour
period in one large message. Currently buddha-l is running light, only
about five messages a day, most of them brief. At times traffic on the
list does get much heavier. It is difficult to predict (without the
aid of a good astrologer or oneiromancer) when buddha-l will explode
into prolixity; when it does, you'll be grateful for the index option.
