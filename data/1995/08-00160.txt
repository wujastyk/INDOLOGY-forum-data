Aum

Thank you for your gentle and thoughtful reply,  Dominik.  Below is
the letter you sent .. they published it in the February 94 issue
with the notation that it was an email letter.



     I have read an account/review of your recent article on Indian
     history, and I am shocked that you could promote such nonsense.  I
     have in the past enjoyed Hinduism Today, but this article and the
     accompanying editorial are not just ridiculous, but also play into
     the hands of fundamentalist revisionists who are dangerous.  In
     India today there is a strong movement amongst
     politically-motivated right-wingers to find historical reasons to
     justify acts of communal brutality and discrimination.  Your
     article plays right into the hands of these people.
