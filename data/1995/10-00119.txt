RECENT MOGUL GENEALOGY
          Does anyone know if there is anything published on  the genealogy 
          of descendants of the Mogul dynasty AFTER 1957?  Also, can anyone 
          confirm  or disconfirm my impression that  the British government 
          of  India and  the  GOI after independence until the abolition of 
          privy  purses  paid  small pensions to descendants of  the  Mogul 
          emperors?  If  so, which office would have handled this  and  the 
          genealogical record keeping necessary?  Finally, can  anyone tell 
          me if there is a Waqf for Moguls in Delhi or elsewhere? 
          I  ask because a patron wants  to investigate a  family tradition 
          they are descendants of the last Mogul, Bahadur Shah Zafar. 
          Thanks for any help,
