Refining Gold
Howard,
I'm afraid I can't give you the information you require, but the
following contributory "evidence" may be of interest to you.
In the Buddhist Pali Canon, there is a discourse of the Buddha
(Anguttara Nikaya III.16) where he uses a similar analogy, saying that
there are 5 impurities in gold that make it no longer soft, workable,
and bright (pabhassara), but brittle, namely - iron (ayo), copper (loham),
tin (tipum), lead (siisam) and silver (sajjham).
Similarly, the 5 hindrances stop the mind (citta) from becoming soft and
workable, and resplendent.
By the way, isn't there something wrong with the first word of the
second line of your quotation?
