ABSTRACT

The Dance of the Guru's Eight Aspects (Guru mTshan brgyad 'chams) is 
century Tibetan master Guru Chos-dbang. Its performance at the small 
rNying-ma-pa monastery in Rewalsar in Himachal Pradesh is described, 
along with the accompanying recitations of praises. The account is 
put into its context as a Buddhist tantric practice by a discussion 
of the tradition of 'chams, the general VajrayAna principles which 
underlie it, and the specific tantric ritual practices performed by 
the monks in preparation for the dances. How interpretations of the 
VajrayAna imagery shed light on its meaning and the significance of 
the concept of ''Liberation through seeing'' are explored.
