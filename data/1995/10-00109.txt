DR.S.KALYANARAMAN said:
If it's the one I think you mean, it is
_Indian Medicinal Plants: a compendium of 500 species_ ed. by
Vaidyaratnam P. S. Varier's Arya Vaidya Sala, Kottakal.  Madras: Orient
Longman, 1994- .  I have three volumes, but no. 4 should be out by now.
Another very good recent book from the same stable, but with a
different, and more botanical, slant is
V. V. Sivarajan and Indira Balachandran, _Ayurvedic drugs and thier
plant sources_.  New Delhi etc., Oxford and IBH Publishing, 1994.
