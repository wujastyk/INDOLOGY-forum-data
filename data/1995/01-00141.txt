Culture and Accounting
Have a look at Arjun Appadurai's essay on colonial enumeration, in 
Breckenridge, Carol A., and Peter van der Veer, eds.  1993.  Orientalism 
and the Postcolonial Predicament: Perspectives on South Asia.  
Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania Press.
Probably has some useful references.
