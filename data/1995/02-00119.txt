Further to my earlier posting on the above mentioned subject...
wherein I mentioned ...

>in the *abhishekam path* of Abhiyanandi and Meghanandi (?), but
>I have not been able to locate the exact citations.

I wonder if any of the Indology readers can help me locate passages from 
the above authors and any of the following citations:

1. Divyan nhahyan... Kundkunda, __Chaityabhakti__

2. Khirdhisalilpuridi kanchan kalasihn addhsahahsehin|
   Deva Jinabhisayam mahavibhudiykunvati||
			Acharya Yativrishabh, verse 584

4. Abhishekamahnitya(nam)... Nrinderasena, _Sidhantasara_, verse 6

5. Jinabhishekhasatpatr... Jinasena, _Adipurana_, verses 49, 81.

The above quotations have been gathered from a Hindi source, which
does not provide any bibliographical details. 

I would appreciate any help in this matter.
