The Sarasvati River
I'm planning a paper on the Sarasvati River in the Rg Veda and the
Mahabharata. I want to find correlations between the changes in the role
and significance of the Sarasvati River in both texts and changes in
language, ideology, actors, confrontations, etc. in those two texts. Also,
I have in mind some of the recent archaeological/geological findings.
My question is whether any of the members of this list have done something
similar or know of anyone else who has. I'd really appreciate any comments
in this regard.
Thank you very much for your kind attention to this matter.
