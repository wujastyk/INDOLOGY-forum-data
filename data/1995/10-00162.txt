Meaning of Panini
Let us not get carried away by the modern meaning of the word Pathan.  
However, it is clear that Panini is called a resident of the town of 
Shalaatura, which is identified with a locality near Peshawar.  I have 
shown in some of my work that Panini exhibits his familiarity with the 
linguistic facts of this northwestern frontier.
