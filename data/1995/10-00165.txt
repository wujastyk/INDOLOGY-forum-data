Information on Sri Chinmoy & His Followers
Recently I had a request for first-hand information concerning Sri 
Chinmoy that came from a writer who is preparing an article for Outside 
magazine.  If you have done research on Sri Chinmoy, or have close 
acquaintance, or know someone who is able and willing to be interviewed, 
kindly contact the writer -- Devon Jackson, telephone 212-941-0157 in New 
York City, USA -- or me by e-mail.
Many thanks.
