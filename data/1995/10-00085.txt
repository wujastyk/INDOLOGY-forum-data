Etymology of kSatriya
DR.S.KALYANARAMAN said:
But some lexemes are indeed inventions - that is precisely the problem. For
example many Sanskrit words were created on the basis of mistaken
backformations from Prakrit. In some cases the correct Sanskrit form was
not recognized; in others the Prakrit form did not derive from
Indo-European at all, but from languages of other  groups, some of which
are probably no longer extant.
Again, sometimes words are used erroneously. If this happens in a well-read
work, the error may find its way into the lexicographical literature and be
perpetuated.
Sometimes words are simply invented for literary or other purposes.
Sometimes a copyist's error creates a new word or word meaning which is
subsequently repeated by others.
And so on.
