Apart from Wendy Doniger's references on the above topic in her book, 
Hindu Myths, I have not come across any new reference in English.
But on the Jain Rsabha as an avatar of Vishnu, I found one:
Padmanabh S. Jaini, Jina Rsabha as an avatara of Visnu
Bull. of School of Oriental and Asian Studies,
XL, 2, 1977, p. 321-337
