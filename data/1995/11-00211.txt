new translations
I am interested in Satyanad Kichenassamy's sugestion about scientific 
translations:
"I think most of us would agree that there is such a thing as a
`scientific translation.' It is one which aims at conveying the intent
of
the author as far as it has been reconstructed, AND NOTHING ELSE." 
This is a useful goal in a translation, but certainly one with very
limited
possibility of success.  To render any ideas in language one must assume
the cultural world to which it refers.  Even in philosophy this leaves a
great deal implicit and so susceptable to interpolations that different 
translators will treat differently.  
Like objectivity in any descriptive discussion, scientific translation
has
definite usefulness as an ideal, but I don't think we should confuse 
selves by expecting that we can easily achieve such translation outside
the world of mathematics.
