Temple Destruction in TAMIL NADU
Presented here are the particulars of muslim monuments which stand on the
sites and/or have been built with the materials of the Hindu temples in
Tamilnad. This is a draft list, and needs revision. The reason being
different sources provide different dates and names for the same monument.
Many muslim saints are known by several names, which creates confusion in
identifying their mazars and dargahs. This should serve as a brief
summary. 
Please note that these are the muslim monuments standing (today) on the 
sites of the demolished Hindu Temples in the present Tamil Nadu state only.
