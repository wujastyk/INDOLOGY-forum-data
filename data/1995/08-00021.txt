Sorry,
	The text I have been reading is not Pozadhavastu, but 
Bhaizajyavastu of the Muulasarvaastivaadavinaya.

Subject: Aarya/Dasyu in a Buddhist text


	While reading the Skt text of Pozadhavastu (Gilgit Manuscripts, 
Vol. III, Part I, p. 258), I came across an interesting passage.  Here, 
Buddha is deciding how he should preach to the four guardians of the 
directions (DhRtaraazTra, ViruuDHaka, etc.).  He says that two of them 
are 'aaryajaatiiya' and two are 'dasyujaatiiya'.  If he teaches in the 
'aarya vaak' then the Dasyus will not comprehend it, and if he teaches in 
the 'dasyuvaak' then the Aryas will not comprehend it.  Finally, he 
decides to preach each in his own type of language.  While the 'aarya 
vaak' is obviously Sanskrit, the little pieces of Dasyuvaak are some 
incomprehensible words.  Besides this, the Arya guardians are in the east 
and the south, while the Dasyu guardians are in the west and the north.
	Has anyone written anything about this passage?  Are there 
similar or contrasting passages elsewhere in Buddhist literature?

	All the best,
				Madhav Deshpande
