     From future births, when even his body is a burden?

     Verse 346

     He who slays the conceit which clamors "I" and "mine" 
     Will enter a realm above the celestials' world.

     Verse 347

     If one clings to his attachments, refusing to let go, 
     Sorrows will not let go their grip on him.

     Verse 348

     Those who renounce totally reach the highest peak; 
     The rest remain ensnared in delusions net.

     Verse 349

     Birth ceases when all attachments are severed; 
     Otherwise, one beholds unceasingly the transitoriness of life.

     Verse 350

     Attach yourself to Him who is free from all attachments.  Bind
     yourself to that bond in order that all other bonds may be
     broken.
