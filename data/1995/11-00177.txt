Re Ms. Doniger's translations
I am sure there are differences with respect to applicability of "manushya
dharma" to gods.  Perhaps, somebody else can clarify.
one aspect of Rudra is the personification of anger, hence "raudraavatara".
Daksha(prajapati) also means Ritual-skill.  The symbolic meaning here is that
rituals performed without observing proper protocol could lead to disastrous
reasults.   Since Yaska says that "manushya dharma" does not apply to gods,
when human like relationships are described, they can only be symbolic.   I see
nothing "modern" about it
That is the whole point, freedom of speech not withstanding.
yes, if it were only that.  The academic criticisms would have been just like
"the dog barking at the full moon".  But, now misrepresentations such as those
of Ms. Doniger, in the hands of persons like Pat Robertson is propagated to
millions of believing people.   That is the cause of the hurt.
