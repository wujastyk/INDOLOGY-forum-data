PATRA; PATRI
          RE: Patri 
          The prima facie derivation would  be  that  he  is  a "vessel" of 
          divine influence.  In  Pune there is  a festival in which brahmin 
          women become possessed after blowing vigorously over  the  mouths 
          of pots as  in  the  US  we would over  the mouth of  a bottle; I 
          forget the name of the festival and the deity; perhaps one of our 
          Maharashtrian  members  can   supply.    Is   this  technique  of 
          possession used elsewhere,  and  in  particular  by  the  patris? 
          (Would however a pot, with a constricted neck, count as  a patra? 
          Intuitively I think of a patra as a plate, dish, or bowl.)
