Actually, I think that's far
from clear...

Like different stages in the
life of a person, what may have
been appropriate forty years ago
may no longer be appropriate now...

A healthy, well-educated young
person (analogous to India's
economy today) can compete on 
level terms with anyone.  But when
it was a baby (or rather, the 
exhausted victim of a vampire),
maybe it needed protection -- 
especially from vampires.
