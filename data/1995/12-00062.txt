Thank you very, very much for your help!
Hans-Georg Turstig
Rigveda 1.50
His shining beams now introduce
the God who knows all living things,
that all may see the Sun.
Accompanying the somber Night,
the stars, like thieves, now steel away
at the all-seeing Sun's approach.
His herald rays are seen from far,
shining on the homes of men like tongues
of fire that burn and blaze.
Swift and beautiful are you,
O Sun, maker of the Light, who illumines
all the radiant sky.
You shine upon the hosts of Gods
and likewise on the race of men, that all
may see the heavenly Light.
You steer your path across the sky,
O Sun, across the realms of space,
measuring the days by means of your shining,
observing all that comes to birth.
Gazing beyond the dark, we reach
the supreme Light and attain the Sun,
the God of Gods, the light.
Rigveda 4.57.3
Sweet be the plans for us, sweet be the heavens,
sweet be the waters and the air of the sky!
May the Lord of the Field show us honeylike sweetness.
Yajurveda 19.9
O supreme Lord, you are full of fiery spirit.
Give me fiery spirit.
You are vigor; give me vigor.
You are strength; give me strength.
You are discipline; give me discipline.
You are conquering might; give me conquering might.
