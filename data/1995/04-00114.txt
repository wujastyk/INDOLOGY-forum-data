In response to the question about additional references to the spha.tika 
crystal metaphor: The _Sa,mdhinirmocana-suutra_ also uses this in chapter 
6, in which Buddha tells Gu.naakara that various gems (sapphires, 
emeralds, rubies, etc.) make a spha.tika crystal appear to be colored. 
This can be found on pp. 85-6 of my translation (_Wisdom of Buddha: The 
Sa.mdhinirmocana-suutra_: Berkeley: Dharma, 1995).
