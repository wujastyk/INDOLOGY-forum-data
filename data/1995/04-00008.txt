I recently came across the following little-known publication, which may
be of interest to librarians and MS scholars:

S. R. Rao (ed.), _Descriptive catalogue of palmleaf manuscripts_,
(Keladi: Keladi Museum and Historical Research Bureau, 1985).

Available from
Keladi Museum,
P. O. Keladi,
Shimoga District,
Karnataka 577 443
India.

Price: Rs.110, $20.

The book contains descriptions of Sanskrit, Telugu and Kannada
manuscripts on all subjects.
