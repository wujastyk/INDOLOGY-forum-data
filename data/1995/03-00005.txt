     I thought Members of Indology-L would be very much interested in the
     following posting with erudite commentary from my dear friend
     Richard P. Hayes.

   > how to make a lucrative television mini-series out of some of the
   > translations, dictionaries, encyclopedias, concordances, educational
   > software and other scholarly tools that they sponsored).

   > Hearings tomorrow:  the Senate committtee considering reauthorization
   > has scheduled a public hearing tomorrow at 9:30am.
   > Witnesses will include Sheldon Hackney, head of the NEH
   > and a state Humanities Council chair.
   > David Barry, Essex College
   > Alberta Arthurs, Rockefeller Foundation
   > Walter Burns, American Enterprise Institute
   > Barry Gross, National Association of Scholars
   > There is some chance that those hearings will be covered by C-Span.

   > NEH is an important scholarly as well as a political issue.  It
   > funds 65% of all fellowships in the fields of history, literature,
   > philosophy etc.  Without NEH funding almost no great collaborative
   > projects in the humanities would be possible.  Members of MEDTEXTL
   > probably already know many NEH supported projects, which include
   > editions of works by Thomas Aquinas, William Ockham, John Duns Scotus,
   > and William James; translation of works by Augustine; a data
   > base of major Sanskrit texts; museum displays of Byzantine religious
   > art; as well as many of the widely available electronic texts of the
   > Jewish and Christian Bibles.
   > On February 22, 1995, the House Appropriations Subcommittee voted
   > to rescind $5 million from the 1994 NEH Budget.  Defeated was a
   > proposal by Sidney Yates to cut the budget by much less, $1 million;
   > the vote was along party lines.
   > This is the first of three separate issues affecting the NEH which
   > will be considerd by Congress this year.  The other two are the
   > budget for 1995 and reauthorization.
   > The process of dealing with reauthorization and the two budgets is
   > expected to take a long time; it must be completed by September 30,
   > 1996.
   > Individuals or department wishing to support the reauthorization
   > and continued funding of the NEH probably should send letters to
   > their congressional delegations, explaining NEH's impact on their
   > field and their university.  In addition, they may send xerox
   > copies of those letters to 36 other members of Congress, to the:
   > 11 members of the House Committee considering budget issues,
   > 11 members of the Senate Committee considering reauthorization &
   > 14 key chairs, leaders, and ranking minority members.
