     I thought Members of Indology-L would be very much interested in the
     following posting with erudite commentary from my dear friend
     Richard P. Hayes.

   > Dear denizens of BUDDHA-L,

   > (known in the USA as the Republicans and in Canada under a variety
   > of labels: Liberal Party, Reform Party, Bloc Quebecois, Progressive
   > Conservative Party and New Democratic Party) have sewn hysteria

   > many worthwhile programs to be given the nirvana option is the
   > National Endowment for the Humanities.

   > world at all had it not been for their help. Twice during the long
   > trek from graduation to permanent employment I kept naama and ruupa
   > together by living on funds from NEH translation grants. These grants
   > made it possible for me to continue doing academic research at a time
   > when I had no other employment related to academic work. Now the fact
   > that the NEH kept me in the academic world may be reason enough to
   > disband it, but it must be remembered that it also sponsored the work
   > of *good* scholars, many of whom are members of this list.
   > It seems to me extremely unlikely that any commercial enterprise is
   > likely to take the place of the NEH in sponsoring academically
   > worthwhile work that has no commercial value. The kind of scholarship
   > that the NEH has funded is very unlikely to be picked up either by
   > the private sector or by State agencies. Many years ago, when Ronald

   > wealthy eccentric) would do. And yet the NEH was already marked for
   > severe reductions in funding, and it was well known that several
   > influential people in Washington felt particularly strongly that the
   > NEH should be abolished (presumably because no one could figure out
   > how to make a lucrative television mini-series out of some of the
   > translations, dictionaries, encyclopedias, concordances, educational
   > software and other scholarly tools that they sponsored).
   > Being a Canadian now, I no longer have much political leverage in the
   > USA. Some of you do have such leverage. If you feel like using it in

   >Congress and suggest that they draft a constitutional amendment
   >prohibiting the use of BUDDHA-L for making remarks critical of asinine
   >governmental policy.

   > funds 65% of all fellowships in the fields of history, literature,

   > art; as well as many of the widely available electronic texts of the
   > Jewish and Christian Bibles.
   > On February 22, 1995, the House Appropriations Subcommittee voted
   > to rescind $5 million from the 1994 NEH Budget.  Defeated was a
   > proposal by Sidney Yates to cut the budget by much less, $1 million;
   > the vote was along party lines.
   > This is the first of three separate issues affecting the NEH which
   > will be considerd by Congress this year.  The other two are the
   > budget for 1995 and reauthorization.
   > The process of dealing with reauthorization and the two budgets is
   > expected to take a long time; it must be completed by September 30,
   > 1996.
   > Individuals or department wishing to support the reauthorization
   > and continued funding of the NEH probably should send letters to
   > their congressional delegations, explaining NEH's impact on their
   > field and their university.  In addition, they may send xerox
   > copies of those letters to 36 other members of Congress, to the:
   > 11 members of the House Committee considering budget issues,
   > 11 members of the Senate Committee considering reauthorization &
   > 14 key chairs, leaders, and ranking minority members.
