Apology to the group
David, this seems absolutely brilliant! There are, by the way, programs
that can make such a search and replace operation very, very easy! The Lexa
suite, which can be obtained from the University of Bergen, contains such a
program (LREPLACE) which I constantly use to convert from one
transliteration system to another. LREPLACE uses a list file with the
search item in one column and the exchange item in another column. If you
work out the sorting order for a dummy sort, using LREPLACE (or a similar
program) makes the whole process very quick and easy.
Lexa (version 6) can be obtained from the Norwegian Computing Centre for
the Humanities, Harald H}rfagres gt. 31, 5007 Bergen, Norway, tel: +47 55
21 22 54/55/56; fax +47 55 32 26 56. Email: icame at hd.uib.no. It costs about
NOK 700,- which includes several (necessary) manuals. The program as such
is public domain and is, I believe, available from a server in Bergen, but
you need the manuals.
