Dear colleague,

You can find a good colour photograph of  vibhitaka nuts in: Database on 
medicinal plants used in Ayurveda, vol. 3 (edited by P.C. Sharma, M.B. Yelne 
and T.J. Dennis, Central Council of Research in Ayurveda and Siddha, New 
Delhi 2001), between p.158 and 159.

Literature on betel chewing is available in my `An annotated bibliography of 
Indian Medicine' (www.indianmedicine.nl). The e(lectronic) Journal of Indian 
Medicine will publish in its vol. 1, 3 (to be released very soon and to be 
found on the same website) an elaborate study on the origin of betel 
chewing.

I hope this may be of some help to you,

Jan Meulenbeld
