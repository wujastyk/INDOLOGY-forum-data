Census Sanskrit
This discussion about Spoken Sanskrit was sparked off by my mention of a 
new article by Adi Hastings on the subject.
That article is thoughtful, careful, and worth a read.  It deals rather 
well with this particular issue, of what it means when a family claims 
that Skt is the language of their home.
