Dear Professor Rocher,
thank you very much for pointing out this mistake. I have corrected it in

Betreff: Re: "GRETIL e-library" now open



Many thanks for this great service to scholarship.

May I suggest a correction to the catalog of files? The article on toddy
in Ceylon is not by Henry Thomas Colebrooke, who was a civilian. The
author was (later Sir) William Macbean George Colebrooke, who had a
distinguished military and administrative career in Sri Lanka, and later
in the Caribbean.

All best wishes,
Rosane Rocher
