AW: Buddhacarita 1,1-7 and 25-40
Claus Vogel, "On the first Canto of A"svagho.sa's Buddhacarita", in
Indo-Iranian Journal IX,4 (1966), p. 267, fn.5: "What remains of the
original Buddhacarita is preserved in a single palm-leaf manuscript (A)
dating c. 1300 and once consisting of 55 folios (up to xiv, 31), the first,
third, seventh, and eight being no longer extant. The Cambridge and Paris
manuscripts (C, D, P) are merely copies of a revised and augmented
transcript (beta) made in 1830 by Am.rtaananda, the Residency pundit of
Kathmandu, directly from A. ."
