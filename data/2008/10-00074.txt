This might be of some general relevence.  I recollect having read many years 
ago Joseph Campbell's take on this -- probably in his Mythology quartet.  He 
had the idea that people only "existed" in ancient societies in terms of 
their social role -- hence the widow was "satii" precisely because she 
fulfilled her expected role.  On the other hand, anybody who did not fulfil 
their expected role wereliterally non-existent blanks on the social 
landscape.

Best wishes,
