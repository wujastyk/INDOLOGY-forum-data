Speaking as one of those who converted the original files to text 
files, I have realized that the GRETIL version, as well as its source 
in Osaka, do have the problem of '????' ('a' with macron and acute) 
having become simply 'a'. I think we (or was it I?) introduced this 
error when removing accents. The original did have the correct 
reading (with accent). We will make an updated version ASAP.
