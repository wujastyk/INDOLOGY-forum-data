Query:  scholarship on leather-working in India
Dear Indology Listserv,
I am sending this message on behalf of a graduate student currently
not active on Indology, please respond to him directly if you have
any suggestions:
Dear Indologists,
Do any of you know of any scholarship on Leather-working in India? Or
perhaps Dalit artifact production more generally?
I am a PhD Student in Ethnomusicology at NYU currently proposing my
dissertation on tabla makers in Varanasi.  I am looking for
background material and any suggestions will be greatly appreciated.
Thanks,
Allen Roda
