Arches
Friends:
I am working on arches in Indian designs and forms.
Very often Indian artists and artisans create arches even in a two dimensional design to enclose the main form. 
Are these arches a variation of toranas or festoons or gateways?
I would love hearing from scholars who have thought about this.
Regards.
