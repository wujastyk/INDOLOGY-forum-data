gemination/degemination of stops in ligature with semi-vowels
I do not think the earlier posters were not making sense. For the
significant difference between bodhisattva / bodhisatva and the other
examples is that Buddhist Sanskrit has a tendency to invariably have
meanings slightly different from 'normal' Sanskrit, also depending on the
context. This is part of the socio-religious rhetoric of Indian sects in
their debates. A good point to my mind is the very Buddhist advaya and the
terribly Brahmanical advaita.
If the Sanskrit bodhisattva / bodhisatva is a kind of translation from
Prakrit / Pali bodhisatta, the latter could have had the meaning of
bodhisatvan with a meaning different from bodhisattva. The double or single
t makes a semantic difference possible which is not the case with tatva /
tattva or karma / karmma. 
But I agree, not being a pucka Buddhologist, that I could not care less
whether bodhisattva is a bodhisatva or a bodhisatta which is actually
perhaps a bodhisatvan. The socio-religious meanings of the term can be
understood from the way the term is used in various Buddhist texts.

At last something sensible in the double t debate! Thanks!
