Google continues to amaze: Hindi dictionary
It's indeed amazing.
But still a beta version.
I tried "love":
it gives only anuraaga as translation: no prem, pyaar, priiti, ishq etc.;
under phrases related to "love" there is for instance: "national (!) love
and affection" which is translated as "sahaja (!) prem aur anuraag"
("national" for "natural" which sounds vaguely similar?).
There seems to be an option to give feedback according to the FAQ but I
could not reach that option from the Dictionary mode.
