It looks like Siddham script, still used in Japan for mantras and dharanis.

See http://www.omniglot.com/writing/siddham.htm and
http://visiblemantra.org/alphabet.html

Prof. Kim can either try to decipher the text using the sites above (the
hard way), or find a specialist in Shingon Buddhism who might recognize the
dharanis (the easy way).
