The database at Kew Gardens can be helpful, but it is not an international 
centralized solution to problems in botanical nomenclature.  It mainly 
records all the different names that have been used, but doesn't actually 
sort out the problems.  It leaves many major issues for further research.
Hooker is good, but completely a-historical.  Although it's wonderful for 
botanists, I've found it generally unhelpful for the kinds of problems we 
routinely face.
The reason I recommended the Sivarajan/Balachandran works in my last post, 
Warrier, Nambiar and Ramankutty, that Stella cited -- is that they were 
prepared by collaborations between scholars who are/were 
university-trained botanists, as well as Sanskritists and practicing 
vaidyas in Kerala.  These chaps know their onions, so to speak.
