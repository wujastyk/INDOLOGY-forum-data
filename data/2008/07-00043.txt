Bows in ancient India
The callosity is usually referred to with the word ki.na joined to jyaa or
maurvii.
Abhij;naana-;sakuntala 1.13: j;naasyasi kiyad bhujo me rak.sati
maurvii-ki.naa:nka iti
Raghu-va.m;sa 16.84: jyaaghaata-rekhaa-ki.na-laa;nchanena
Raghu-va.m;sa 18.47/48: ... abaddha-maurvii-ki.na-laa;nchanena ... tasya
bhujena bhuumi.h. A variant for abaddha is alabdha.
Giita-govinda 1.2/6 (dhara.ni-dhara.na-ki.na-cakra-gari.s.the)  is
inapplicable to the present context
Enlarged Apte also records M.rcchaka.tika 2.11 as containing an occurrence
of ki.na, which I cannot verify at present.
The same source, under jyaa, (p. 745) records jyaaghaata-vaara.na as the
word for the handguard used by the archers.
