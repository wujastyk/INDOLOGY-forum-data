Left and right
Dear Stella,
yes, and so does the other Latin word for ?left?: laevus (but
apparently in augury it means ?favorable?). Multiple layers of
taboo replacement ? further to French gauche, Spanish izquierdo,
but Italian still sinistro.
To complement Peter?s reference to Gonda on dak?i?a, here is one
on v?ma:
   Manfred Mayrhofer, 1968. Zu altindisch v?ma? ?link?. Die
   Sprache 14: 160.
Incidentally, in the G?ndh?r? commentary that I am editing, v?ma
is contrasted with anuloma (and thus apparently equivalent to
pratiloma):
   a?ulomo pa?icasamupado ? vamo pusuja?apak?o
All best,
Stefan
