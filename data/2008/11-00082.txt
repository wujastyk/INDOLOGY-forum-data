Compatible Font for Macs and PCs...
Older Mac fonts aren't necessarily incompatible with OSX.  When OSX  
first came out, myself and a tech person at UT-Austin got Manjushree  
working (and it still does in 10.5.5; it simply required appending  
".rsrc" to the keyboard layout file before installing it).  I just  
installed Gandhari since I know I have to switch to unicode someday  
and it works just peachy -- including anusvAra + m (perhaps you were  
not using the extended keyboard layout?).  I can't see immediately  
whether or how it might do complex diacritics (e.g., a long vowel with  
accent), but I just started looking at it.
Best,
Steven
