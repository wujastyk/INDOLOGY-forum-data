I am not aware of such a suggestion.   From memory, the book won a prize 
from the Univ. of Calcutta in about 1913.  The drawings and illustrations 
are an important element of the book, and they are partly original 
drawings by GM himself, or else by an artist working for the publisher, 
and partly reproductions from European histories of surgery and medicine. 
But GM is straightforward about this: he doesn't claim that the 
artwork is older than his book or anything like that.
I'd be interested to know more about the source of this suspicion, if it 
comes to mind.
