``Tabulae increases the availability and usefulness of online journals
containing Indological and Buddhological material. Through links and
digital feeds it makes this material easier to find, access and use.
Tabulae aims to refer to all relevant online periodicals, to be a
resource for researchers who want to make use of the vast amount of
constantly arising digital material.
At present, Tabulae directs researchers to the Tables of Contents for
more than 130 periodicals. This includes the Indo-Iranian Journal,
Asian Philosophy, the Journal of the American Academy of Religion,
Numen, T?oung Pao, and The Journal of the Royal Anthropological
Institute.
Tabulae links to the digital version of articles and to the electronic
version of previous issues. Researchers will find bibliographic data
for all periodicals.''
