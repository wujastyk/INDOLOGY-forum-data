2. Nepali Crash Course
Do you want to avoid such a scene? Then you should be able to speak a bit of Nepali! If you think you won't need more than some basic English to ask for a room, to order your dinner in Kathmandus Freak-Street or on the popular trekking routes, then you may be right. But it might not get you much further. Nepali has increasingly become a lingua franca of the Central Himalayas where more and more of its diverse ethnic groups speak it as a second language. Nepal itself is a small country in the lap of the Himalayas with an astounding geographical and cultural diversity, where only little more than a hundred kilometres separate the subtropical forests of the Terai from the worlds highest mountains, where Hinduism meets and sometimes mingles with Tantric Buddhism, and where past and present clash more forcefully than elsewhere. Whether you are interested in contemporary Nepal or ancient South Asia, whether you want to go trekking or to experience the busy
 live in the streets of Kathmandu - the Nepali language will open a door to a fascinating culture. To help you walking through this door, Laxmi Nath Shrestha has come all the way from the Kathmandu Valley to the South Asia Institute in Heidelberg. He is an experienced teacher who has taught Nepali to generations of both students and researchers and has proven that he can make you start speaking Nepali in just one week. Starting from the first day, this course will be held in Nepali only: Sipping a cup of ciya, you will discuss the latest political developments   as one does every morning in the streets of Kathmandu.
