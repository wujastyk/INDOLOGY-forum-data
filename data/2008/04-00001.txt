For centuries Jewish women along India?s Malabar Coast filled
notebooks with music they sang in Malayalam at weddings, community
celebrations
and rituals. Now they have been painstakingly re-discovered, performed
and recorded in Israel, and been the subject of international exchange
on
the cultures of Hindus, Christians and Jews in India?s vibrant
multi-ethnic Kerala region. A unique local and international partnership
will present
this music and those key to its revival at three DC area events.
