Attention Andrea Acri
I think Dr Frits Stall is very right. Dr Lokesh Chandra never had an email.
But I have his new contact number. Please note it down; 91-11-26515800. I
hope this works. You may also note down his postal address in case you do
not have it;

Prof Lokesh Chandra
J-22 Hauz Khas Enclave
New Delhi - 110016
