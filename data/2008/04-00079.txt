but see also the review by Sternbach:
"Professor P.K. Gode commemoration volume 
[Review]," JAOS 81(2) [1961]: 154-158, p.158.
Also, there is a wealth of primary sources cited in:
Sukumari Bhattacharji, "Prostitution in Ancient 
India," Social Scientist, 15(2) [Feb. 1987]: 
32-61.
Although not mentioned in that article, I have 
seen references in Tibetan literature to 
prostitutes belonging to tantric communities in 
India (ca. 8th-9th century), and I would be 
interested in hearing about any references 
*specifically* discussing the role of 
prostitutes/courtesans in Indian tantric circles 
should you come across them.
