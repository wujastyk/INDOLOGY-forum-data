Dear members of the list!

I seem to remember that Indian thought holds transitory things for less
"real" than non-transitory things. Only things that are permanent and
indivisible are fully real. Do any of you know of any Indian scriptures
where this idea is being discussed?

Best regards,

Lars Martin Fosse
