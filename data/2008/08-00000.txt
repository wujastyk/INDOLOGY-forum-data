Padmashali
Friends:
Can anyone help me with the story of Padmashali, the first weavers, who draw a fibre from the lotus that arises from the navel of Vishnu, and then weave fabrics for the gods?
I remember seeing an Andhra scroll may years ago. Are there any images in museums of this episode?
Thank you.
Harsha.
