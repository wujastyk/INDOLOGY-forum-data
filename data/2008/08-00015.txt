Dear all,
The "Waxing Syllable Principle (WSP)" is extensively applied in Buddhist canonical prose texts and in some Jaina prose texts as well. See Study 2 in my Style and Function: A Study of the Dominant Stylistic Features of the Prose Portions of Pali Canonical Sutta Texts and their Mnemonic Function. Tokyo: International Institute for Buddhist Studies, 1997. Oskar von Hin?ber also wrote about this (mentioned in my study).
