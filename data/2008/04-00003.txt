Summary
The /Lamp that Integrates the Practices/ is a systematic and 
comprehensive exposition of the most advanced yogas of the Esoteric 
Community (Guhyasamaja) Tantra as espoused by the Noble Tradition, an 
influential school of interpretation within the Mahayoga traditions of 
Indian Buddhist esoterism. Equal in authority to Nagarjuna?s famous 
/Five Stages/ (Pa?cakrama), Aryadeva?s work is perhaps the earliest 
prose example of the ?stages of the mantra path? genre in Sanskrit. Its 
studied gradualism exerted immense influence on later Indian and Tibetan 
tradition, and it is widely cited by masters from all four major 
lineages of Tibetan Buddhism.
This volume presents the /Lamp/ in a tri-lingual format: its Sanskrit 
original critically-edited from recently-identified manuscripts, a 
critical edition of the eleventh-century Tibetan translation by Rin-chen 
Bzang-po (including notes on readings found in ?lost,? alternative 
translations), and a thoroughly-annotated English translation.
Includes an introductory study discussing the history of the Guhyasamaja 
and its exegetical traditions, surveying the scriptural and commentarial 
sources of the Noble Tradition, and analyzing in detail the contents of 
the Lamp. Features a detailed, tri-lingual glossary.
Christian K. Wedemeyer is Assistant Professor of the History of 
Religions at the University of Chicago Divinity School
