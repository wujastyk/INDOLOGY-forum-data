Yes, Dominik, I guess that's how things are when you're outside, looking in.
Of the 65 or so entries under "author: Kielhorn, Franz" Google Books gives me
access to none (in numbers: 0). I take the "No preview available" message as
a euphemism for: "Off limits to non-US residents". Curiously enough, there is
a 1891 publication by G?ttingen University among them (where Kielhorn taught
in later years). Of course, unlike the Mexican bean farmer who suddenly finds
his seed corns patented by the company across the border, I could circumvent
these restrictions via a proxy, but I'm not sure whether I really want to
play that game.
Best regards
Reinhold

I'm in the USA at the moment, and I used the "advanced search"
books.Google.com screen, and ticked "full view" so that I would only see
books that were wholly downloadable.  As a result, I have been able to
download these volumes in toto.
I know there are sometimes different permissions when using google from
countries outside the USA.  I have in the past had success overcoming
these limitations by connecting to Google through an anonymizing proxy
server (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server).
Best,
Dominik
