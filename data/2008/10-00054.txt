Dave's birds
Dear Simon,
I don't know if I ever replied to this. But better late than never. I  
haven't xeroxed these as yet, but will do one of these days. I wish  
the indexes could be inserted in the book itself.
Hope you are fine. I was very disappointed that you were not  
interested in our Sanskrit job. Incidentally, we did not fill it in  
the end. Both Dimitrov and Stefan Baums turned it down. As a result I  
have to teach 1st year Sanskrit this year again, adding to an already  
heavy teaching load.
Are you planning to go to Kyoto?
All good wishes
Stella
