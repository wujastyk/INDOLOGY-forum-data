dear oliver,
thanks for the message. as you know i am a regular user and admirer of  
your program(s) and i am eager to test the new version of your ocr. i  
write this rather personal message to the list in order to encourage  
others to try and take advantage of this great tool. my sincere apologies  
to those of you who might find this mail inappropriate for a scholarly  
list.
