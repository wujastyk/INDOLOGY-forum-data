New issue of EJVS: Mahadevan on Southern Mbh,              Vedic Brahmins & paleography
Many thanks, T.P., for your notes!  One of my grad. students is  
interested in attending the Vajapeya, hence my question. He is a  
musician, and thus wants to work on Samaveda.
Good luck with your research: you already have turned up new data.As  
for the Chola plates, have they been published somewhere? It would be  
intresting to see the distribution of Shakhas which are unusual  
sometimes (Kanvas in Colamandalam etc,)
PS. George Hart has written to you by now, long letter about details...
All the best!
Michael
