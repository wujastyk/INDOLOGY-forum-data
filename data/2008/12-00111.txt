Dear Indologists,
Bodhisattva is a Sanskrit word which is derived as bodhaye sattvam cittam yasya.
<as +satr? = sat,and <sat+tva>=sattva.There is no scope of application of two rules here:
8.4.46 aco rah?bhy?m dve and 8.4.47 anaci ca. If we use to spell it by one ?t?,it would be
fully ungrammatical in Sanskrit/Buddhist Sanskrit.There is no other rule for alternation in this context.Buddhist Poet ?ryas?ra,Grammarian Jinendrabuddhi and so many texts show ?tt? here.As to some Hybrid words there may be found some differences but not in Sanskrit ones.
Regards,

The rule speaks of optional gemination not of dropping onr from a?pair when it
is part of the etymology DB

Adding to Dominic's comment,

P??ini has rules regarding gemination, some of them as options in 8.4.46 ff.
 So, not all of the variations (in pronunciation and in orthography) that
involve geminations are ungrammatical.  I think most of them are in fact
P??inian acceptable.

This particular one, V+ttva and V+tva, is optionally allowed by 8.4.47.

Prof. Cardona had an article on nasals that explored various pronunciation
options adopted by Vedic Pr?ti??khyas.  Is it published?  There, if I
remember correctly, opinions of some teachers that prohibit certain geminations
were mentioned.  Prohibition of ttva was one of them.

Some copyists are very strict about which options they use in writing: two
Malayalam manuscripts I used have:

- t[y/v]a instead of tt[y/v]a to the point of utpatyabh?va? rather than
utpattyabh?va?

- although they double t after r; thus k?rtyate rather than k?rttyate

Other copyists seem more liberal. I no more pay attention, which may be not a
good practice, whether in a particular manuscript it is sattva or satva if the
manuscript comes from the North.  I think it's rather common to see both
sattva and satva in a manuscripts.

So, my point is to emphasize Dominic's conclusion:

> it seems unlikely that anything can be useful known about the history of
the word bodhisattva/bodhisatva from the way it is written in manuscripts.

Even according to P??ini, bodhisattva and bodhisatva can be the same thing.
