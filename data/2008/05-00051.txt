Subject: Information on two tiirthas
Message-ID: <161227082648.23782.16259841279895690625.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear Indologists,

I am wondering if any of you would happen to have any information about 
two tiirthas in Maharashtra, namely Puur.natiirtha and Aatmatiirtha.  
Both are on the bank of the Godaavarii river, and both are mentioned in 
the Gautamiimaahaatmya of the Brahmapuraa.na.  However, I would be 
curious to know if they are mentioned in other sources as well.

Many thanks.

Sincerely,
Toke
