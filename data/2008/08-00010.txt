Kyoto-Harvard transliteration
Sanjay (below) seems to refer to the frequent Vedic compound  
zUdrArya- (Unicode: ??dr?rya-), where to many people's surprise,  
the grammarians mentioned below included, the Shudras come first.
Well, for a good  reason  -- again that of prosody or syllable count.
The Rgveda mostly has the clear, metrically indicated, trisyllabic  
reading  [aariya]  (?riya) for (KH) Arya (aarya, ?rya-), as noted  
already by Grassmann 1873, RV Dictionary column 185-6.
In short, Panini-Behaghel's  (2+1+1, 2+2+2) rule is strictly  
followed, against all contemporary social sensitivities:
zUdra+Ariya (??dra+?riya):  2 syll + 3 syllables, or :  2+1, 2+1+1  
morae.
In fact, this has been noted and explained long ago by Hans Oertel :  
"zUdrArya", I think in ZDMG 1936;  see now H.Oertel, Kleine  
Schriften. Heinrich Hettrich,  Thomas Oberlies (eds.). Stuttgart :  
Franz Steiner Verlag, 1994.
A nice weekend!
