Dear Reinhold,
In the study of Asian incunabula, we usually cite a leporello as an 
"accordion-fold" book. In Nepal Bhasa (Newar) they are called 
thyasaphu and can be anything from very small to about about 100 
folds or more. Frequently they have an arsenic coating on one side, 
which gives it a characteristic yellow cast,  to keep the insects at 
bay.
  An important example of an iconographic model book in the thyasaphu 
format is at:

  from the Circle of Bliss Exhibition
Another with the arsenic coating is at:
http://huntingtonarchive.osu.edu/exhib/CircleofBliss/
ChakraRitual02A.html
Also from the CoB
While the Model books are often called sketch books they are usually 
not. True sketchbooks were an artist is learning something are known 
(the Jivarama sketch book of NS 555) (see my  "Nevar Artist 
Jivarama's Sketch Book," in Indian Art Treasures: Suresh Neotia 
Collection. Varanasi; J?ana-Pravaha (Center for Cultural Studies and 
Research) with Mosaic Books 2006, pp. 74-85) it may be downloaded at:

This is actually one of the most complete studies of a "sketch book" 
to date.
The four complete and two fragmentary designs you have posted, 
suggest that this is a model book of designs for the ornamentation of 
a shrine or temple of some sort. However, since it is clearly not 
Buddhist, I am at a loss to say what it might be.
One interesting aside, is that the figure fighting the lion has 
twisted the lion around into the "broken-back" position of many 
central Asian animals motifs of the first millennium BCE and first 
half of the first millennium CE
Given the Bhujimo characters and their relationship to the 
Inscriptions of Jivarama,, I would date this to ca 1450 ? 30.
I hope this is useful. I would love to see more if you would be 
willing to share them.
All the best
John
