Dear members of the list,
on behalf of a colleague who does not have access to Indology, I would like
post this query:
******************
Dear Members of the List,
I am looking for a reference from early Indian culture, about a 
mythological figure who drives a chariot drawn by antelopes. It 
probably figures in the Mahabharata. Can you help me find this 
reference and possibly notify me about additional literature written 
on this subject?
I would be most obliged.
Thank you all in advance,
Sarolta Tat?r
