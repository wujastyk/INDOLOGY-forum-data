Yes, using H-K rather than UTF-8 for the headwords and embedded Skt
terms was intentional. I've uploaded a screen shot of a typical page
viewed with the web browser Opera. The image is attached at the tail
end of the following page (`zams-opera.png'):

The primary and secondary headwords for `zaMs', and all the Skt terms
appearing within the body of the definition, are consistently
transliterated using H-K. They are also dark red for emphasis. I've
done this as most users, myself included, appear to prefer to search
for headwords using H-K. That said, I am also aware that there are a
good number of others who prefer UTF-8 so to suit them I have written
code that should be reasonably easy to modify.
If you look at the HTML source you will see that all Skt terms are
marked up in this manner:
 <span class="s">zaMs</span> <span class="s">zaMs</span>
It shouldn't be too difficult to write a script (Perl?) to convert
anything appearing between this class of span into UTF-8. If someone
would like to write such a thing then I would be happy to run it over
the final release so that both a Harvard-Kyoto and UTF-8 version is
available for download.
Kind regards,
 Richard
