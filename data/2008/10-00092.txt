Hello All--

Please see the Yoga Consultation Program for this year's AAR  
conference in Chicago. We have two excellent sessions with a  
decidedly Buddhist flavor this year. Hope that you will join us for  
the sessions and for the business meeting on Monday. Please note that  
there has been a change to session A2-328 which was originally listed  
as "Tamil and Tibetan Yoga"--as the presenter on Tamil yoga had to  
withdraw, we have focused the session uniquely on Tibetan Buddhist yoga.

Best Wishes,
Stuart Sarbacker
Northwestern University
