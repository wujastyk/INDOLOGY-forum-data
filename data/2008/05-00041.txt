There's a snag here. A clear and pretty Nagari font, and two different  
keyboard layouts (QWERTY and Inscript) come along with Leopard, and they  
function quite well, but not with just any application. The issue is the  
font rendering engines: Apple has its own, which is not compatible with  
most fonts. OpenType and TrueType fonts do not render correctly with most  
applications. (On the other hand, if you use TeX in its miraculous XeTeX  
version, all such fonts seem to render correctly.)

No problem. See my page

of my experiences.
