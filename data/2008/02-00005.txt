Yoga Consultation CFP
Dear Colleagues,
Apologies for cross-posting.
Below I have copied the 2008 Call for Papers for the American Academy  
of Religion's "Yoga in Theory and Practice Consultation." The AAR  
meeting will be held November 1-3, 2008, in Chicago, Illinois. We  
were greatly pleased by the range and quality of the proposals  
received last year, and strongly encourage those considering  
submitting a proposal this year on a topic related to yoga to do so  
to our consultation. The Call for Papers includes topics especially  
of interest to the consultation, though submissions on other topics  
will be considered.
Please note that the AAR deadline for submission of proposals is  
Monday, February 25th this year.
CALL FOR PAPERS: YOGA IN THEORY AND PRACTICE CONSULTATION
The Yoga in Theory and Practice Consultation seeks paper and session  
proposals on the topic of yoga in theory and practice from a variety  
of perspectives, including sociology, anthropology, history of  
religions, philosophy, theology, and cultural studies. Submissions  
should be made through OP3. Suggested topics for 2008 include: 1)  
Translating Yoga Texts; 2) Women and Yoga; 3) Yogic Powers (with the  
Mysticism Group); 4) Living Yoga Masters; 5) Yoga and Tantra (with  
the Tantric Studies Group); 6) Sri Aurobindo on Yoga; and 7) Siddha  
Yoga. Submissions should be made through the OP3 system, which can be  
found at the following link: http://www.aarweb.org/Meetings/

Please feel free to contact me or my colleague Chris Chapple

Best WIshes,
