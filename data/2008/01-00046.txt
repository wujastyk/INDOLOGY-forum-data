Dear colleagues,

If by any chance any one of you happens to have in his or her  
photographic collections any pictures of one of the  
following ;Silaahaara inscriptions, that are of sufficient quality to  
illustrate a publication, and that could be made available to me, I  
would be very grateful indeed:

- Vihar stone inscription of Anantad?va of ?aka 1003 (Mirashi 1977:  
113?115, pl. XLV)
- Cintra stone inscription of Apar?ditya I of ?. 1059 (Mirashi 1977:  
127?130, pl. LV)

- Chanje stone inscription of Apar?ditya I of ?. 1060 (Mirashi 1977:  
130?132, pl. LVII)

- Bassein stone inscription of Mallik?rjuna of ?. 1083 (Mirashi  
1977: 153?156)

- Lonad stone inscription of Apar?ditya II of ?. 1106 (Mirashi 1977:  
156?158, pl. LXVIII)

- Bassein Stone inscription of Anantad?va II of ?. 1120 (Mirashi  
1977: 163?165, pl. LXXI)

- Miraj copper-plate inscription of M?rasi?ha of ?. 980 (Mirashi  
1977: 200-206, plate XC)

- Talale copper-plate inscription of Ga??ar?ditya of ?. 1032  
(Mirashi 1977: 207?214, pl. XCII)

The references are to Vasudev Vishnu Mirashi (1977) Corpus  
Inscriptionum Indicarum vol. VI. Inscriptions of the ?il?h?ras. New  
Delhi: Archaeological Survey of India.

It is particularly the figures of sun and moon on these inscriptions  
that interest me. These figures seems to appear commonly on Satii- or  
Hero-Stones (see e.g. <www.chennaimuseum.org/draft/gallery/01/04/ 
stone3.htm>). Images of non-;Silaahaara inscriptions that do not  
clearly belong to the categories of Satii/Hero-stones, but that do  
display the same motif, would also be of interest to me.

Thanks in advance for any tips that you might be able to give or  
photos that you may be able to provide!
