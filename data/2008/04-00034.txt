The effects of different Sanskrit poetic meters
There are some interesting, though perhaps more impressionistic than 
authoritative observations on such matters in the footnotes to Hank 
Heifetz's translation of the Kumara-sambhava (U. of Calif. Press, 1985).

FW: The effects of different Sanskrit poetic meters
Greetings,
Can anyone please direct me to articles discussing the effects of different 
Sanskrit poetic meters. That is, do different meters, such as anustubh, 
vasantatilaka, shArdUlavikrI?ita, mAlinI, evoke particular moods? If so, 
what are the moods and how are they evoked?
There is an appreciation that these meters do evoke different moods, but has 
anyone articulated the mechanism.
Thankyou,
