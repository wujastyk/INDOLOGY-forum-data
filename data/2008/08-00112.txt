kalivrttadarshapurana
dear friends
is any body aware of  a certain purana called Kalpita kalivrttadarshapurana.
I saw it in the collection of my Guru Martanda dikshita recently. it is
printed but no details. it is also purvarddha. is there any uttararddha? It
is critical of colonial practices in nature. I want to translate it.
