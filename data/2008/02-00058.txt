It may depend on which version of gallica you are using. There is
besides <http://gallica.bnf.fr> now a new beta version:
<http://gallica2.bnf.fr>.
The user interface of gallica2 has improved; it does not rely entirely
on PDF and provides above the text symbolic buttons for printing and
downloading (represented by a printer and floppy disk symbol). See e.g.
URL: <http://gallica2.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k330787>
(that's Louis Finot: Les lapidaires indiennes)

Surely, this can be annoying. I have seen reproductions where Chinese
characters are mingled into one big black lump and this makes such
reproductions hardly usable. Perhaps, the people behind Gallica wanted
to prevent reprint publishers from using their materials for commercial
purposes.
