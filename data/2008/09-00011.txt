Dear Colleague,

The Istituto Veneto di Scienze, Lettere ed Arti, the Astronomy
Department of Padua University, the INAF-Padua Astronomical
Observatory, and the Vatican Observatory are jointly organizing the
sixth international conference on "The Inspiration of Astronomical
Phenomena" (INSAP) to celebrate the 400th anniversary of Galileo's
first astronomical uses of the telescope.

The Conference will be held on October 18-23, 2009 at Palazzo
Franchetti in Venice, Italy. The Conference venue is one of the
premises of the Istituto Veneto di Scienze, Lettere ed Arti. It faces
onto the Grand Canal and it is surrounded by a garden.
The Conference will explore humanity's fascination with the sky, which
has been a strong and often dominant element in the human life and
culture. It provides a meeting place for scholars from a variety of
disciplines and artists to present and discuss their studies on the
cultural impact and inspirations of astronomical phenomena. The list
of topics discussed in the previous INSAP conferences is available at
the INSAP web site http://www.insap.org/insap/

The first day of the Venice Conference will be devoted to Galilean
contributions.

The attendance will necessarily be limited to 170 participants. We
suggest that interested individuals register as soon as possible.
The form for the registration and submission of the abstracts for the
oral and poster contributions is available at
http://www.astro.unipd.it/insap6/registration.html
The final deadline for registration and abstract submission will be
communicated in the next announcement.

The registration fee is foreseen to be Euro 350 and it includes the
welcome party, four lunches, and coffee breaks. We are considering a
reduced fee for the participants not attending the full Conference.
We are negotiating with the Memorie della Societa` Astronomica
Italiana to publish the Conference proceedings in their main Journal.
Full information on the scientific programme, venue, and transport, is
available on the Conference web site
http://www.astro.unipd.it/insap6/

Venice is one of most beautiful and attractive cities in the world. We
recommend you to make directly your own hotel reservation, taking into
account that for not expensive accommodations well-advanced booking is
suggested. A list of some hotels close to the Conference venue and
general web sites for hotels in Venice is available at
http://www.astro.unipd.it/insap6/accommodation.html

The previous INSAP conferences took place in 1994 in a retreat at
Rocca di Papa in Italy, near the Vatican Observatory, in 1999 at the
International Office of the University of Malta, in 2001 at the
Palermo Observatory in Italy, in 2003 at the Oxford University, and in
2005 at the Adler Planetarium and Astronomy Museum in Chicago.
Details about these conferences are available at
http://www.insap.org/insap/

Please forward this announcement to others who might be interested.
We are looking forward to meet you in Venice.
