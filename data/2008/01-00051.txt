    Bhattoji and Nagoji
  Grammarians and Philosophers of Language in Early Modern Banaras
   
   
  2 p.m. until 6 p.m., 29 February, 2008
  The Russell Room, Balliol College, Oxford
   
   
  At this workshop we seek to explore the social and intellectual history of grammarians in early modern Banaras.  Why was grammar and language philosophy so important at this time?  Why were philosophers so interested in fixing the understanding of meaning? What was the intellectual profile of grammarians and the range of their output, beyond strictly disciplinary grammatical works?  What was the nature of their engagement and contribution to the notoriously disputatious intellectual scene in Banaras in those days?  What were their links to social and political settings in Maharashtra?  What was their engagement with contemporary social and scientific or technological issues?   What was their teaching career like, and what became of their disciples, children and schools of thought?  What explains the unexpected and unusual durability of the collective memory of Bhattoji and Nagoji as distinctive individuals, even today?
