Sankara and the Authorship Issue
     Dear Mr.Horacio Francisco Arganis Juarez,
There are
many works of Adi Sankaraacharya translated into
English and are available.For example: chAndogya
upanishad translated by Swami Swahanananda,
aitareyOpanishaD translated by Swami Sarvananda,
SvEtASvatara upanishaD transalated by Swami
Lokeswarananda etc.Almost all the works of Adi
Sankaracharya is available in Ramakrishna Mutt in
Chennai.But, I have not heard of any contravercy abot
the authorship of Adi Sankaraacharya's works.

Shyam Ranganathan <shyamr at YORKU.CA> escribi?:  Dear Indologists,
I?m trying to find recent material that deals with Sankara and the authorship
problem. I know the papers by Paul Hacker translated in _Philology and
Confrontation_. Any references on the topic since (or before) would be greatly
appreciated.
With thanks,
