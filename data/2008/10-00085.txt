Dear Indologists,
It is well known that the Present World is passing through the age of Economic globalization,industrial growth and electronic systems.Today's young men prefer job-oriented courses such as Engg,Medical,Economics,Management,etc.,which are updated regularly according to the needs of the hour.
Unlike it numbers of students in Indology are going small day by day.Now these are the burning questions :
1.What are the problems and prospects of Sanskrit Studies in Modern World?
?
2.How could the invaluable elements of Sanskrit Studies figure as a new discipline/curriculum and be utilized in current Educational Set up?
I request you all to shed light on it and suggest a solution to this problem in global perspective?
Thanks,
Sincerely
