There seems to be an unstated or implicit caveat in Birgit's thoughtful
post: she refers several times in slightly different words to the
difficulties of "fully public resources." Now, when a specialist in logic
says something like this, it makes me want to ask "what about not fully
public resources?"  For instance, what about making available on a password
protected site materials which can be accessed by --let's say, as an
example--only those who have an Indology sign-in password? Does this change
the status of things? I am aware that some places post things on intra-nets
for internal use, which I understand as a sort of digital version of placing
a folder with a copy behind the librarian's desk. Could this be similar? But
maybe I'm being too optimistic?
