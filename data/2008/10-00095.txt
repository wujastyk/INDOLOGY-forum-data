Medical History
Thank you so much.
  I have not seen Kohn's encyclopedia, but will try to track it down.  
Yes, even narrative descriptions, let alone anything resembling  
statistics all seem to be European. The Tibetan information is  
valuable. There must be Chinese sources as well?
Ibn Battuta writes about a disease in South India, that MUST have been  
the Black Death, the dates and descriptions of symptoms are right, but  
I have been hitting a blank wall with the Plague of Justinian in India.
Gratefully,
Mary
