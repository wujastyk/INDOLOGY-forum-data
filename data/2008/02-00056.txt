Sorry for having not mentioned (or reminded) in the discussion the 
following three on-going projects of Indological digital libraries at
http://dsal.uchicago.edu/
http://dli.iiit.ac.in/ (searchable but... sometime it is easier to 
find there a book through google than through their own search-tool)

>Ananda Wood, Knowledge before printing and after: The Indian
