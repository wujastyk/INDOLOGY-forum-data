bodhisattva/bodhisatva
21 12 08 
Examining the Tibetan equivalents may help. I?hesitate to intimate the results in?detail. Posting here an? account of the course adopted?may prove to be?cumbrous and, I am afraid, pedantic and self-promoting, contrary to the spirit of the club.??But -sattva? does not seem to have been meant, neither in bodhisatva(bya:n.chub.sems.dpah) nor in vajrasatva(rdo.rje sems.dpah). (The velar n is :n above.) The connotation of valiance in the final two syllables reminds one of satvan. But further enquiries are possible and desirable.??I hope someone will do. The learned contributions were very encouraging and enlightening for me. I am grateful to?my colleagues.

Re: bodhisattva/bodhisatva
It should be noted that this type of degemination is not at all limited to
Bauddha manuscripts.
It is the norm for words like "tattva" to be spelled
"tatva" in almost every "Saiva manuscript I have seen, and at
least one Naa.taka.
Most of these are from Nepal.  Perhaps someone with broader experience can
comment if it reaches to other genres and regions as well.

doesn't remember any with two t's
that I have looked into are always one t, (e.g., OM VAJRA SA TVA HUM as
constructed in Tibetan script.)
January, so cannot carry this any farther at this time.
