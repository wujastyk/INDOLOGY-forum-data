Call for papers

 

International Colloquium

 

? Artistic creation confronted with political and religious constraints

from the Himalayas to Central Asia,

from antiquity till now ?

 

 

            SEECHAC (Soci?t? Europ?enne pour l'?tude des Civilisations de l'Himalaya et de l'Asie Centrale, European Society for the Study of Himalayan and Centralasiatic Civilizations, http://seechac.org) will organize its first colloquium in Paris, at the College de France, next April 

(Monday, April 27thand Tuesday, April 28th, 2009)

            It may be attended by every SEECHAC member. The organizing committee (for the time being, the SEECHAC board and council) will do everything possible to get a maximum attendance of non-French scholars so as to stress the European membership of SEECHAC. The subject of this first colloquium is 

? Artistic creation confronted with political and religious constraints

from the Himalayas to Central Asia, from antiquity till now ?

            The papers may be delivered and written in any European language, preferably English or French. Each speaker will get c. 30 minutes for delivering her/his paper, followed by questions and remarks.

            Junior and senior colleagues willing to participate in the colloquium should inform as early as possible at contact at seechac.org. Those willing to submit a paper should send a few lines abstract to the same address before December 31th, 2008. A selection will be made, if necessary, by the organizing committee. SEECHAC will manage to publish the proceedings of the colloquium. 

            Up to now, SEECHAC did not get any grant for contributing to the expenses of foreign scholars attending the colloquium. But it has applied for some.

            The second SEECHAC colloquium would be held, hopefully, in an European country other than France.
