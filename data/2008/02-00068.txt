It would be helpful if someone could list sites in FSU countries (whether the main language of the site is Russian, Tchechen or any other language) with "quite a large number of Indological books", and/or sites of "rapidshare e-book trading communities" relevant to Indologists.

    Hi all,
A few comments on some of the issues/questions raised on this thread:
  ***
  Consequently, many Bittorrent hosts have moved to the FSU ("Former 
Soviet Union") or other "anarchy-friendly" (as someone described 
them) countries, where bittorrent activity is far from dead. There 
are, as well, a large number of rapidshare e-book trading communities 
flourishing there as well, and if you can read Russian you can find 
quite a large number of Indological books on some of those lists as 
well.
