Birds in Sanskrit Literature
Dear Colleagues,
Does anybody have a copy of Dave's "Birds in Sanskrit Literature" to hand" 
?  If so, could you do me a kindness ?
I would like to know what he says about the "kaara.n.dava" and the 
"cakravaaka".  The "kaara.n.dava" is often identified with the "cakravaaka", 
but it also seems to be a different bird on occasion as I have encountered 
the two names side by side in texts.
Many thanks in advance.
