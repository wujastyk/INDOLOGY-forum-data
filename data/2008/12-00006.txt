Indology.info website temporarily offline
Apologies all round: the website indology.info has been offline for a few
hours.  We are working hard to resolve the technical difficulty, and hope
to be live again by the end of the day.
The website has recently moved home - invisibly - from servers in the UK
to better servers in the USA.  But the former hosts in the UK gave us some
wrong information and that has caused the difficulties in the transition.
Best,
Dominik
