AW: Request for help with manuscript
The episode of 
Mairaava.na-/Mahiiraava.na-caritra/-vadha or 
Hanumadvijaya is indeed very popular (see 
Koskikallio & Vielle, Epic and Puranic Texts 
attributed to Jaimini, IT 27, 2001, pp. 78-81). 
In relation to the concerned picture (7), there 
are for example several vernacular North-Eastern 
(Bengali, Oriya and Assamese) versions (see W. L. 
Smith, Raamaaya.na traditions in Eastern Asia, p. 
145-153, for the details of the episode).
So Hanuman is indeed the best candidate for picture 9 too.
With best wishes,
