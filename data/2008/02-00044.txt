They have also some old and rare works in the field of Sanskrit  
philology, e.g.

Paulinus <a sancto Bartholomaeo> (1748-1806)
Vyacarana seu locupletissima samscrdamicae linguae institutio in usum  
Fidei Praeconum in India Orientali, et Virorum Litteratorum in Europa  
adornata / a P. Paulino a S. Bartholomaeo. - Romae : Typis S.  
Congreg. de Propag. Fide, 1804. - XXIV, 333 pp.

I have put nearly 800 works into Google's "add to my library"  
function (not all of them necessarily of indological importance):

(most of them are available in more or less complete form, with the  
main restriction: works published before 1863)

For all non-US citizens/residents they block generally access for  
publications after the publishing date 1863 (there are exceptions, of  
course).
In 2007, the Bavarian State Library in Munich signed a contract with  
Google:

The official text says they want to scan only books free of  
copyright. I am curious to see if this means: American or German  
copyright laws.

All the best
