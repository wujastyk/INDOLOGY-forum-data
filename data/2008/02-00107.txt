Dear Michael,

The following mail of yours must have been sent to the whole list by
oversight. No problem. To respond briefly, I placed a printout of my notes
on approximately the first 250 pages of the published volume 1 of Raghavan's
edn in your mailbox on 08 December 2002 (as I had come to Harvard as
visiting professor at that time) and I mailed you a photocopy of the text of
Ingalls's Preface (what we were up to that point imprecisely calling
"Introduction") on 3/4 January 2003. I also sent you a pdf of the former on
08 December 2002.  If for some reason you cannot locate the printout, the
pdf, the photocopy and our e-mail correspondence of the time, I will gladly
make the files/documents available to you again. It will, however, take a
little time to regain access to Ingalls' Preface for photocopying, since my
study is being reorganized to accommodate the books and papers I had to
bring home from my UBC office.

My e-mail addresses <ashok.aklujkar at ubc.ca> and
<aklujkar at interchange.ubc.ca> still work. The latter may, however, be phased
out by UBC in the months to come.

With best wishes,

ashok

Dear Ashok,
your note (below, and your new email address) remind me of the talk
we had some years ago.

I plan to bring out the 2nd part of Raghavan's Srinagraprakasa later
this year. Could you  please make a search for your old notes (and
Ingalls' notes, I recall) on this text so that we might be able to
include them in the edition?
