svArtha derivation and subtypes of taddhita pratyaya affixes
Dear Ulrich,
is there any chance that the derivation being discussed is not
    mitra/maitra ? maitra
but
    mitra/maitra ? maitraka/maitreya
(?byams pa being a possible Tibetan translation for both maitra 
and maitreya, though you don?t say what the Tibetan word for 
maitra is in your passage), and that mthun pa?i rkyen is just an 
unusual translation for taddhita (influenced by the meaning 
?agreeable? of hita)?
If Bh?vaviveka?s bdag gi don la de dang mthun pa?i rkyen is for 
sv?rthataddhitapratyaya, then I can sort of see how Avalokitavrata 
comes to explain the whole term as bdag dang mthun pa?i tshig gi 
rkyen ?affix of a word agreeing with itself (in meaning)? (taking 
sv?rthataddhita as a unit). Still, the step from commentary to 
subcommentary remains a bit peculiar. Is it possible that the 
Tibetan translation of Bh?vaviveka?s commentary was used alongside 
the Sanskrit original in the preparation of the Tibetan 
translation of Avalokitavrata?s subcommentary (similar to the 
Ud?navarga / Ud?navargavivara?a translation procedure as 
demonstrated by Michael Balk)?
Best wishes,
