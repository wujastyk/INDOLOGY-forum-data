HTML Monier-Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary (Version 0.3              - Release Candidate 1)
Hi Richard,
    Thanks for making available this version of the MW HTML.  As I downloaded and looked at it, I see that the main word entrees are in Harvard-Kyoto notation while the names of cited texts appear in full diacritics (utf8?).  Is that by design?  Best,
Madhav M. Deshpande

HTML Monier-Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary (Version 0.3 - Release Candidate 1)
[Apologies for cross-posting]
Dear Colleagues,
The first release candidate for the new HTML version of Monier-Williams
Sanskrit-English Dictionary is now available:
 Indica et Buddhica - Repositorium
 http://repositorium.indica-et-buddhica.org/
This represents a complete rewrite based on the most recent version of
the Cologne source file (`MONIER2008' -- download from here:
http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/download.html). All users of
previous versions are encouraged to upgrade.
The dictionary marked up in HTML (`XHTML 1.0 Strict') can be found in
the zip archive `mw_html_rc1.zip'. Installation instructions can be
found in the `README.TXT' file.
As usual, comments and corrections are most welcome. They should be
mailed to me or entered in this form, whatever is convenient:
 http://indica-et-buddhica.org/sections/about-ieb/contact-form 
A final release will be made once I have had a chance to incorporate
suggestions.
Best regards,
 Richard Mahoney
P.S. I would like to express my deep gratitude to Dr Thomas Malten for
kindly permitting a new release of the HTML version based on the most
recent version of the Cologne source.
