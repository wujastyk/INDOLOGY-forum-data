Dear Professor Hart,
1) I think we do well to maintain a distinction between the scribe who composed the text and the stone mason who inscribed the text on the stone.
2) If I understand you correctly, you read the inscriptions as follows: "the/this stone is/represents the stealing of cattle by ...". As far as I see it this is something else than "this stone is erected to commemorate the stealing of cattle by ..." But if you say this is a normal sentence in Cankam Tamil literature, then I suppose it is.
3) Why don't you read my review first, before reacting.
With kind regards
Herman Tieken

Would someone explain how this illiterate person knew how to write the 
name of the dead hero?  There are many Tamils, Hindi speakers, English 
speakers who habitually misspell words.  Shakespeare is supposed to 
have spelled his own name many ways.  I don't think he was illiterate.
