If you know exactly what you're after -- e.g. Wright Collection, Add.
1478 for the "Sik.saasamuccaya -- then you should be able to send a
request directly to:
 mss at lib.cam.ac.uk (may have changed, please check)
They should be able to give you a quote for making a duplicate from
their masters. The advantage of this is that if you ever receive an
older, poor quality film then chances are you may very well be able to
have it refilmed.
Kind regards,
 Richard
