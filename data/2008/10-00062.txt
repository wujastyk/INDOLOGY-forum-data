Prav=?UTF-8?Q?=E1=B9=9Btti/niv=E1=B9=9Btti:?= publications and              fol d-out chart
Dear Colleagues,
I am doing some work on the concepts of prav?tti and niv?tti.  
Would any of you be able to recommend good discussions on this topic,  
wether primary or secondary sources? I am aware of Greg Bailey 1985  
publication (_Materials for the Study of Ancient Indian Ideologies:  
Prav?tti and Niv?tti_), and of M.A. Yamunacharya 1950 publication  
('The ethics of prav?tti and niv?tti'), but not much else.
Also, many years ago I photocopied a fold-out chart (looking a bit  
like a genealogical or mss 'tree') of prav?tti/niv?tti activities  
from a book - if I remember correctly - by a (male) Indian scholar.  
After a number of office moves, however, I don't seem to be able to  
find it again (though I am sure it must be somewhere). Would anyone  
be able to tell me which was the publication I originally got it  
from? I cannot even remember what the book was about - I'm pretty  
sure it wasn't Prav?tti/niv?tti as such; possibly some dharma- 
related topic, or maybe just a general overview of Hinduism / some  
major Indic topic (Vedanta?).
Any help would be much appreciated!
Best regards
