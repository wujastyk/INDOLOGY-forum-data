Early Inscribed Hero Stones in Tamil Nadu
I find this baffling.  1. The order of the words is quite normal --  
kal (stone) is the subject, akol is the predicate nominative.  There  
is nothing strange at all about the order of the words.  I have been  
reading Sangam Tamil intensively, and see nothing at all anomalous  
about this.  2. The poems and the inscriptions indicate that these  
stones were raised to men fallen in a cattle raid.  Obviously, someone  
in this environment knew how to read and write -- is it such a stretch  
to suppose the stone mason could actually read what he was writing?   
The writing system is quite simple and quite logical.  And if writing  
was used by people who lived in marginal areas in the 2nd century BCE,  
it must have been used more widely 3 centuries later (the time of  
Sangam literature).  Are we to suppose that no one could read or  
write, and these illiterate people were engraving stones, somehow  
intuiting how to write the name of the fallen hero, just copying "a  
string of images"?
