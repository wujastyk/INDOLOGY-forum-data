> Summary:
>
> The paper  is important  in several respects. It provides evidence
> for the
> early (Sangam period)  movement of Northern  (Madhyadesha) Vedic
> Brahmins into the peninsula and of that of their later successors in
> Pallava
> and Cola time. The first group includes among others, the rare
> schools of
> the Vadhula Taittiriyas, the Kaushitaki Rgvedins and the Jaiminiya
> Samavedins.
>
> The first  group wears the traditional tuft?shikha in Sanskrit and
> kutumi in
> Tamil?toward the front of the head and is known thus as the Purvashikha
> Brahmans; the second group wears it to the back of the head, and thus
> are
> called  Aparashikha Brahmans.
>
> The  Purvashikha group brought the archetype of the Mahabharata or its
> proto-Sharada version to the peninsula, where it  evolved into the
> Southern
> Recension (SR), written in Southern  Brahmi script by the beginning
> of the
> Common Era. It was taken, in Kalabhra times, to Malabar by the
> historical
> Nambudiris.
>
> The SR text initially  also remained behind in the Tamil country with
> the
> historical Sholiya Purvashikhas. The Aparashikha Brahmans arriving
> during
> the Pallava period brought along a Northern Recension (NR) text giving
> rise to the much  inflated Grantha-Telugu versions of the SR text.
>
> This scenario explains the anomalous situation that the Malayalam
> version
> of the  SR is the shortest of the SR texts and that  it is closely
> aligned to the
> Sharada text of Kashmir.  It  also explains the influence of another
> NR text
> on the  Grantha-Telugu versions of the SR text.
