Rasa
Dear Mr Ranganathan,
In my view any innovative  research work must be based
on the study of original Sanskrit texts with the help
of standard English translations.Some important books
relating to rasa are as follows:

Eng. tr.by M.N.DATT ED. P. Kumar

3.Sahityadarpana of Visvanatha Eng.tr.by P.V.Kane
4.Rasagangadhara of Jagannatha with Balakrida comm.
5.An Aesthetic Experience acc. to Abhinavagupta
