Dear Dan,

Thank you!  I shall try to find this article. This volcanic theory  
sounds very interesting.

I suppose the East to West theory rests on the notion of the origins  
of the black rat vector and if that is challenged then the whole East  
West spread is questionable, but there are Ibn Battuta's descriptions  
from 1345 in South India, and then the subsequent stories of the  
Genoese ships sailing from Kaffa in the Crimea in 1347, that support  
this particular narrative.

I know there is now also a lot of speculation that the 14th c. plague  
was not even necessarily yersinia pestis. It is astounding that there  
is still so much speculation for one of the world's worst disasters.

I shall continue, I am very grateful to all of you who have provided  
clues...

All Best,
mary
