The powerfully propulsive Tassa drumming of East Indians from the Caribbean region is performed by both Hindus and Muslims, in sacred as well as secular contexts.   Major League Tassa, and accompanying dancers, from Queens, New York will present rhythms used for processions, the Diwali holiday, and weddings, along with contemporary tunes performed at clubs, sports bars and social events in the New York City area.  All of the members of Major League Tassa are Trinidadian-Americans in their twenties and thirties.  Its leader, Anil Raghoonanan, plays the dhol, a big, double-headed bass barrel drum made of wood covered with goatskin.    Kevindra Raghoonanan performs on the jhanj, brass cymbals.  Dave Seetaram, the "fulley," and Doodnath "Phantom" Lalchan, the "cutter," play the conical, clay tassa drum.  The fulley keeps up a steady rhythm, while the lead cutter performs dazzling improvisations while guiding the other players through modulations of the rhythms.   Dancers Amy Basdeo and Lauren Moomlal will perform traditional dancing practiced widely at religious ceremonies and weddings as well as hot, contemporary chutney dancing.
