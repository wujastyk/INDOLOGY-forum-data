faculty positions JRRSU Jaipur
Sure, there are procedural hoops in the USA and Canada, but jobs are still 
advertised internationally, and north America is chock full of foreign 
scholars on full-time contracts.  The Univ. of Alberta, Edmonton, just 
appointed a full professor formerly at the University of Hyderabad, for 
example, for the new chair of Classical Indian Polity and Society. 
That's how it should be.
