Digital Kielhorn
It's a very good idea, Christophe.  I have a growing private collection of 
indological books in digital form that I would gladly donate to someone to 
start off such a library.  But libraries need librarians, and to be 
successful, such an initiative would need a proper institutional base.
I suspect that we are living in a time of transition, and that in a few 
years it will be the norm that when looking up a book in our university 
library catalogues, there will be a button that automatically takes us to 
a digital edition, if one exists.  Something like this is already in place 
in some of the library catalogues I use (UCL, UTexas).  Maybe we should 
just encourage our librarians to push ahead with this kind of facility.
Another way forward would be to tie the digital books and articles that we 
are accumulating to the entries in one of the South Asia research 
databases such as SARDS, ABC, Potter's BIP, Nat. Bib. Ind. Lit., Bibl. 
Asian Studs., etc.
