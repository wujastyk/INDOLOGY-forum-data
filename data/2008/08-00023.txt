As it luckily happens to lie on my desk - Vincent Eltschinger's "Penser 
l'autorit? des ?critures. La Pol?mique de Dharmak?rti contre la notion 
brahmanique orthodoxe d'un Veda sans auteur. Autour de Pram??av?rttika 
I.213-268 et Svav?tti" (Vienna 2007: ?sterreichische Akademie der 
Wissenschaften) contains a footnote on the passage in question with 
further references: p. 102, n. 106. According to Eltschinger, the 
example is widespread and can also be found at ?abarabh??ya on 
M?ma?sas?tra 1.1.5, Ny?yabh??ya on Ny?yas?tra 5.2.10, Dharmak?rti's own 
V?dany?ya (ed. Much, p. 43, l.14), and further in Jaina commentaries on 
the Ava?yakaniryukti, see Nalini Balbir, "The Perfect S?tra as Defined 
by the Jainas", Berliner Indologische Studien 3 (1987), 3-21.

Hope this helps,
