AW: Request for help with manuscript
Dear Reinhold,
I have cc'd my colleague Dina Bangdel to see if she has an ideas. The  
main figure is a monkey with Hands on his legs as well and clear tail  
in both.  He also appears in five as well.  The only monkey I know of  
is Hanuman who is extremely important in Nepal especially at this time.
The Durga is clearly a later addition by some one who simply does not  
have the same skill level as the rondel painter
Is there a 1_06?
