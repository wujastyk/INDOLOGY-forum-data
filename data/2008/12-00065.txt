Dear list members,

the obituary reproduced below appeared today on the LINGUIST Network.

Strangely, Isidore Dyen's interest in Sanskrit is not explicitely
mentionned.

As a complement to the obituary, one should point to:

The Sanskrit Indeclinables of the Hindu Grammarians and Lexicographers
(by Isidore Dyen), which appeared in Language [Language, Vol. 15, No. 3,
Language Dissertation No. 31: The Sanskrit Indeclinables of the Hindu
Grammarians and Lexicographers (Jul. - Sep., 1939), pp. 4-74]

Stable URL: <http://www.jstor.org/stable/522055>

See also the review which appeared in the /Journal of the American
Oriental Society/, Vol. 59, No. 4 (Dec., 1939), pp. 528-530

Stable URL: <http://www.jstor.org/stable/594492>

I suppose not everybody is remembered in the history of a discipline
but I would be interested to read more comments on Isidore Dyen's work

Isidore Dyen, Professor Emeritus of Linguistics at Yale, died on Sunday, 14
December at the age of 95. Professor Dyen joined the Yale faculty in 1942
as Instructor in Malay, and was subsequently Assistant, Associate, and full
Professor in the University until his retirement in 1984. He was a major
figure in the comparative and historical linguistics of the Austronesian
languages, and will be remembered for his many important contributions to
this and allied fields.

A fuller memorial notice will follow at a later date.
