Dear Colleagues,

I've recently set up an RSS 1.0 feed for the main INDOLOGY web site:

 http://indology.info/

To subscribe to this feed please point your web browser or feed reader
at this address:

 http://indology.info/rss1.xml

When browsing the INDOLOGY site you should also be seeing an RSS icon
in your web browser's URL address line (Firefox, Opera &c.). I've also
added a link marked with the same icon at the bottom right hand corner
of each page.
