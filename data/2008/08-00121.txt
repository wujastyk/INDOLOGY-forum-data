Navarang and the rainbow
Dear List members,
does anybody out there?know what the nine colours are when in Hindi (and I imagine Sanskrit) people speak of navarang.
My sense is that it is related to the notion of, all the colours of the rainbow, but as far as I know there are only seven, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet.
So what were the classic Indic nine colours?
Regards
Peter
