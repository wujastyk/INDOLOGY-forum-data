No, few will. In Bengal even in remote villages homeopathy, aayurveda, hekimi or unaanii? and allopathy ie treatment based on knowledge of anatomy and disease creating micro organisms are clearly distinguished. D. B.

Do other people share my impression that while South Asia indeed has many
practitioners of homeopathy in the strict sense, the system of medicine created
by Samuel Hahnemann and introduced to India by John Martin Honigberger,
"homeopathy" is often used there to mean any system of medicine
except mainline modern Western medicine?  (All reservations on these three
adjectives understood, of course!)

I do not find any such extended use of the term in online dictionaries or the
old Webster's 2nd International.
