Sanskrit speakers in Census of India
According to the Census of India figures for Sanskrit speakers I have  
collected  there are some strange figures:
1971 Census 2,212  indicated Sanskrit as their mother tongue
1981 Census 6,106
1991 Census 49,736
2001 Census 14,135
The decadal percentage figures are:
1971-81  	176.04 % increase
1981-91 	714.54 % increase
1991-2001 	-71.5 % decrease
How come  35,601 Sanskrit speakers disappeared between 1991 and  
2001?  Does anyone have an idea?
Best regards to all
