The phrase "claimed to be" in the photograph
accompanying the story posted by Geoffrey Samuel
is significant. Apparently, there has, as yet,
been no expert confirmation that the fragments
recovered by the Dakka Police are indeed 
the authentic remains of the statues that disappeared.

In the meantime, the objects that were shipped to
France seem to be stranded, as the French are
reticent to risk returning them given the
problems with airport security in Dakka.
