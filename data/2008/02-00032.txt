Dear Mark,

The INBUDS site is a fairly useful resource towards this end with
Journals arranged in hiragana order with indications as to pdf
availability:

http://www.inbuds.net/jpn/media/index.html

Another useful resource is the University of Tokyo Digital Repository:

http://repository.dl.itc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/dspace/handle/2261/130

However, I do think that the NationaI Institute of Informatics is the
resource with the largest scope. If you enter the title of the journal
in kana in the search screen, you might have some luck:

http://ci.nii.ac.jp/

With regard to the Journals you cite, you can get contents lists
(only!) via the following sites:

http://sojusha.com/newpage14.htm (BukkyO KenkyU) - old site
http://kamoeji.jp/kokusai.html (BukkyO KenkyU) - new site

http://www.icabs.ac.jp/publication/2-7-1.html (Journal of the International
College of Advanced Buddhist Studies)

http://www.lit.nagoya-u.ac.jp/~indo/Site/2FA3F438-C490-45CC-BB71-325E8ECE21D2.html
(SaMbhASA -  Nagoya Studies in Indian Culture and Buddhism)

I hope that is helpful in some way.

Kind regards,

Antonio Ferreira-Jardim
University of Queensland
