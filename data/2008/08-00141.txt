As Peter already said, the technology used on this site is now dated.  I 
kept seeing gobbledegook, but after fiddling around for a while with 
encodings and fonts it finally settled down.  It's worth the effort to get 
this site working, since there's a mass of textual material there.  There 
are quite a few typos in the texts, but still it's useful.  And apart from 
displaying on the screen, the site will generate a PDF of the text on the 
fly, either in Devanagari or in roman, that one can download.

I get the feeling that this website was a one-shot effort, and that what's 
done is done, and that's it.  I doubt that we would get any response to 
suggestions of improvement.  However, if someone were to go to Kanpur and 
meet the people, and offer to take the thing over and develop it, that 
might work.

Best,
Dominik
