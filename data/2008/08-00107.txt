He made several points about the value of Spoken Sanskrit and included 
useful links to web resources.  With his kind permission we reproduce them

   Dear committee members,

[...]

As a student of Sanskrit who has participated in Samskrita Bharati (SB)
activities, I would like to highlight a couple of activities that may be
of interest to the list members.

[...]

Under the SB banner, we started a inter-university network of Sanskrit
enthusiasts. The participants are mostly graduate students, recent graduate
students and faculty members. Out of these efforts, we meet to practice,
read, learn, write and appreciate the language. Please visit
http://www.speaksanskrit.org/campus/index.shtml for an overview of recent
efforts.

-- In particular, I invite you to peruse the periodic newsletters called
vishvavaaNi. The pdfs are available here:
http://www.speaksanskrit.org/vishvavani/index.shtml

-- Another effort that began recently is a wiki-style series of posts:
www.speaksanskrit.org/wiki

Clearly, I do not mean to say that any of us is a Kalidasa or a Bana. Just
that, we are students who are learning something for which we share a
passion.

[...]
Regards,

-- 
Naresh P. Cuntoor
