Kyoto-Harvard transliteration
I recall an early article by Richard Salomon titled "An ancient 
diplomatic dispute," or something to that effect, which studies the dire 
consequences of contravening to this Sanskrit (and Indo-European) "law." 
Sorry I can't give an exact reference at this time. I am up in the 
mountains, and my collection of offprints is in town. Rich is also out 
of station at the moment.
