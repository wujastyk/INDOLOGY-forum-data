Dear list,
I agree that Sanskrit teachers and students should surely learn to  
fluently communicate in Sanskrit. The present state (especialyy in  
Kerala)is deplorable.
Objection is against utilising Sanskrit for "other" purposes.  
Hindutvavadins have specific agenda behind popularising Sanskrit. They  
have brought out many books among which a small one entitled  
"Samskrtam vada aadhuniko bhava"(published from Aluva, Kerala)  
contains their sectarian approach.They consider Sanskrit only as the  
cultural language of India which is far from truth. They paste  
everywhere a poster which reads "Samskrtam bharatasya  
samskrtikabhasha". What about other Indian languages? Making use of  
Sanskrit in place of Ramakshetra for demolishing Babrimasjid is  
objectionable.
You know what happened in Gujarat. First the poster containing AUM was  
pasted in front of houses of Hindus as a distinguishing mark for the  
convenience of Hindu rioteers before "action". My humble doubt and  
fear is that Sanskrit will be used as a "marker" in the coming  
years.Let it not happen.
Regards
K.Maheswaran Nair
