Kadamba
It remains interesting to note through this 
wonderful tool Pandanus database that
Mitragyna parvifolia Korth. = Stephegyne 
parvifolia [contra parvi"-flora" Apte] S.Vidal, 
same Rubiaceae family as Anthocephalus chinensis 
= skt kadamba but in this case identified with 
Skt vitaana
see: http://images.google.com/images?svnum=10&hl=en&lr=&q=Mitragyna+parvifolia
is identified with Tamil ka.tampai, niirkka.tampu 
(same in Malayaa.lam), ci_n_nakka.tampu, Mal. 
roosu ka.tampu or viimpu,
which means, on the basis of this "sub-variety" 
Dravidian lexical classification, that Apte's 
identification is not wrong at all, and that two 
(close) plants remain possible in this case.
