Clarification about Spoken Sanskrit
Dear Dr. Ganesan,
Our definition of a 'dead language' is simply not the same. To me a  
language is dead when it has a normative grammar which is  
unchangeable. In that sense Panini, presumably unwittingly,  
assassinated Sanskrit already 500 or 400 B.C.- the most brilliant  
assassination in history!
Jan Houben actually proves the point by his statement that "In 1,000  
years time, Sanskrit will still be the same, but every other language  
will have changed beyond recognition."
A living language changes, a dead one stays the same, regardless how  
many journals, articles, literary works etc. etc. are written in that  
language. The only "new" thing about the so called spoken (and also  
written) Sanskrit is its additional nouns and adjectives such as  
bhUmigatena rathenAgataH  "he arrived by the subway train" or  
paramANuvisphoTa  "nuclear blast" (I am inventing these) - the Hindi   
"paramANu bam" is funnier. Verbal and pronominal endings do not seem  
to change. Mummies do not change much either.
As for the Census figures of people declaring Sanskrit their mother- 
tongue (or is it not rather father-tongue?) it has to be taken with a  
grain of salt. By the way, nobody has so far
explained to me what happened with the 35,601 Sanskrit speakers who  
vanished between 1991-2001. Maybe they, like the Malayali poet  
Sacchidanandan's dinosaurs "died out
because they spoke Sanskrit"? Who knows?
Rest assured of my devotion to and love for teaching classical  
Sanskrit. And please don't accuse me of necrophilia!
Yours
