Probably you refer to the message which Oliver Hellwig sent to the Indology List in February this year. I paste it below. Incidentally, this is a question that can easily find an answer through the Archive function of the List, freely accessible to all (http://listserv.liv.ac.uk/archives/indology.html).

  Colleagues

A few months back there was a posting to the list announcing a new, online
RasAyana terminology dictionary. Could someone supply the link?

The site can be found at www.sanskritreader.de (follow   the link for Rasavidya/Indian alchemy; and make sure that JavaScript is   activated).    Best, O. Hellwig
