Sankara and the Authorship Issue
For the devotional Bhaja Govindam  - Mohamudgara,
I note the following two "devotional" editions still available, one 
(31 v.) with a commentary by Swami Chinmayananda, published by the 
Central Chinmaya Mission Trust, and one in Malayalam script with a 
commentary by K. Padmanabha Variar, Kodungallur, 2006 (in two parts : 
19 + 14 stanzas, in a different order).
With best wishes,
Christophe Vielle
