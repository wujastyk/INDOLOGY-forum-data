Sankara and the Authorship Issue
Dear Ashok,
your note (below, and your new email address) remind me of the talk  
we had some years ago.
I plan to bring out the 2nd part of Raghavan's Srinagraprakasa later  
this year. Could you  please make a search for your old notes (and  
Ingalls' notes, I recall) on this text so that we might be able to  
include them in the edition?
Best,
Michael
