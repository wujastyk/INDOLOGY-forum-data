Early Inscribed Hero Stones in Tamil Nadu
Would someone explain how this illiterate person knew how to write the  
name of the dead hero?  There are many Tamils, Hindi speakers, English  
speakers who habitually misspell words.  Shakespeare is supposed to  
have spelled his own name many ways.  I don't think he was illiterate.
