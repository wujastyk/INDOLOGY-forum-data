Kyoto-Harvard transliteration
It is perhaps worth noting that the dominant castes (and arguably  
highest castes) in most of South India are technically "sudra."  In  
Sangam literature, the 4th Varna is not "sudra" but VeLLaaLar, the  
dominant land-owning group.  Through history, the VeLLaaLars and their  
equivalents in other areas (e.g. Reddys and Kammas in Andhra), all  
considered "Sudras" by the 3-4% Brahmin population, have been the  
major force behind the construction of temples and even the  
importation of Brahmins from the north.  Apparently, these  
"Sudras" (later sometimes called "Sat Sudras") were a dominant caste  
before Brahmins arrived in South India, and they maintained that  
position until the present.  It's also worth noting that the Varna  
system after Vedic times was tenuous and ill-defined at best; as far  
as I know, no outside observer ever saw 4 (or 5) Varnas -- they did  
however see caste (jaati / kuTi) differentiation.  George Hart
