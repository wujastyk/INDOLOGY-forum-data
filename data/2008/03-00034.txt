If Arlo can only find the reference, but does not have easy access to the journal Jhankara itself, LC has a good run of it and I may be able to supply the article.  The run is at least  v.18-v.47 (1966:Apr.-1996).

The opinions expressed do not necessarily reflect those of the Library of Congress.
As far as I know, there are some grounds to consider this text a  
spurious composition of the 20th century. The Oriya article that  
demasks the text appeared in the journal Jha?kara (if I remember  
well). I could trace this article, if it would be of any use for you.
