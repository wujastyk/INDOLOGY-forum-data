Kadamba
Indian Medicinal Plants (published by Orient Longman) Vol. 4, p. 120  
has the following:
Neolamarckia cadamba (Roxb.) Bosser
(=Anthocephalus chinensis (Lam) Rich. ex. Walp.)
(A. cadamba (Roxb) Miq.)
It is said to belong to the Rubiaceae family (ma?jiSTha kulam)
They give the word "Kadam" as the English equivalent (hardly helpful).
IMP also says that it is distributed "throughout the Western Ghats at  
low levels in wet places" which seems wrong, since the kadamba tree  
is found in Sanskrit poetry from elsewhere. It occurs three times in  
the GItagovinda.
