svArtha derivation and subtypes of taddhita pratyaya affixes
I am travelling and away from my library just now,
but if my recollection is correct then
Skt. taddhita should be Tib. de la phan pa.
I suggest that de dang mthun pa may not
in fact be an unusual translation of
taddhita, but perhaps a perfectly regular
translation of tatsama. Without access to
my sources, however, I cannot say whether
or not this term had  a documented use
that would be helpful in the present context.
It is of course now most frequently encountered
to describe NIA vocabulary that is borrowed
unchanged from Skt. Might it have referred, then,
to a derivation in which the derived term conserves
the form of its source (as is the case, e.g., in
gu.na derivations where the vowel is short a)?
