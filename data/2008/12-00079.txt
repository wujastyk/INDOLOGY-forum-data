bodhisattva/bodhisatva
I am afraid that at the moment I do not have to hand the review cited by
Prof Slaje, but anyway, so-called failure to geminate on the one hand, and
Paninian but 'irregular' gemination on the other (e.g., karmma etc) are
regular features of many Buddhist Sanskrit (or if one insists, 'hybrid'
Sanskrit) manuscripts, not limited to those of Nepal. (Sometimes this is
script-dependent; in so-called Khotanese-style MSS we find even prraj??
etc., although the language is Sanskrit) I would not consider it a
linguistic feature at all, merely ('merely'?) a habit of scribes. I am not
even sure that I would be willing to go so far as to compare it to the habit
(which I personally find charming) of scholars like Edgerton and Bloomfield
to write elefant and the like.
