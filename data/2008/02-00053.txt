Digital Kielhorn
Thank you very much, dear Peter Wyzlic, for this very useful list you made.
Some additional notes:
- for Wilson's Mackenzie Collection it is in fact 
possible to choose between the two editions and 
various exemplars, cf.
http://books.google.com/books?q=editions:0ZJfTAXwj3ok5Ad8&id=7HUIAAAAQAAJ&hl=de&source=gbs_other_versions_sidebar_s&cad=4
It could be interested to note these details
- if we take the example of NALA AND DAMAYANTI 
AND OTHER POEMS  translated by Henry Hart Milman 
(which is not in the list):
http://books.google.com/books?id=vPY0ekwvgzUC
in this case, it has also been converted into an 
e-text through the Project Gutenberg :
http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/19529
http://infomotions.com/etexts/gutenberg/dirs/1/9/5/2/19529/19529.htm
and is also available in various formats through :
http://manybooks.net/titles/milmanh1952919529-8.html
Should these things be mentioned ?
- what about such available .pdf  (which is not 
really a scanned book, but a kind of second 
edition in electronic form of a previously 
printed book) - do you list them?.
Ananda Wood, Knowledge before printing and after: 
The Indian Tradition in Changing Kerala
www.scholarswithoutborders.in/KnowledgeBeforePrinting&After.pdf
- Of course, there is also the case of the pure 
(free) .pdf periodicals such as the NGMCP 
Newsletter
- do you list also the digital works readable but 
not downloadable that can be found in various 
electronic library catalogues, such as
the partial digital copy (vol. 1-6 + 12) of 
Hortus Malabaricus made by the the University 
Louis Pasteur in Strasbourg  available at

with best wishes,
