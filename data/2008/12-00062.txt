shirt studs in India
Dear Allen,
I've seen these chained-together studs in groups of three or four, for 
specially made kurtas that have at the neck opening several sets of two 
buttonholes, rather than buttons and buttonholes. In the ones I've seen, 
the chains are decorative, and sometimes heavy and ornamented; they go 
outside the kurta, not inside, so that the whole thing is, if made in 
silver or gold, an elegant ornament. (There are cheaper ones in plainer 
metals too.) But I don't know if these are what you have in mind.
all the best for the holidays,
Fran
