2 requests re images of Albrecht Weber
I don't have to hand the following book, which should contain a photo:
Bilder Hundert Deutscher Indologen by Wilhelm Rau
There is also a book by Valentina Stache-Rosen, *German
IndologistsBiographies of Scholars in Indian Studies Writing in German
*, which as I recall also has a number of photographs.
These should both be in LC, I suppose.
Keep us updated if you find the bust!
