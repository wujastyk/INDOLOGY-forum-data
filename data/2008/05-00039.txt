> What is "will" (as in "will-power" "faculties of intelligence and will"...)in Sanskrit? Does the Indian psychology admit such a faculty in man?  Can anyone help?

In view of the large number of divergent responses, referring to different contexts, it might help if we know more about the context of the question.
