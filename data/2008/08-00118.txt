occurrences in intervocalic position (Re: Tamil la-La-Za-ra (Re:              Vedic l
Dear Peter Scharf,
upon re-reading my message,
I have realized that I had not in fact answered your question
about the various "l" (see the list below) being or not being 
"intervocalic").
(N.B. I call them "la", "La" [?a], "Za" [?a], "ra", rather than "l", "L" 
[?], "Z" [?], "r"
because this is how Tamil grammarians talk ..)
All of them belong to the list of the 18 Tamil consonants.
They are NOT vowels.
la and La can occur singly in intervocalic position, and can also be 
doubled. See Examples:
(N.B.  I mention only one of the possible meanings, for the terms given 
as examples;
I just want to show that these are real examples ...)
alar "rumour"
allar "they-are-not" (negative copula)
aLantu (a?antu) "having measured"
aLLal (a??al) "mud, mire"
la and La can also occur before a stop, as in:
alkul "1. side; 2. waist; 3. pudendum muliebre"
koLvAm (ko?v?m) "we shall take"
Za and ra can occur singly in intervocalic position, BUT cannot be doubled.
aZal [a?al] "to cry"
aritu "is-difficult-NEUTER"
Za and ra can also occur as first component of  various clusters
(but there is a metrical constraint on what precedes the cluster:
see TE49 and TE50)
vAZtal [v??tal] "to live"
vAZkkai [v??kkai] "life"
vArntu [v?rntu] "being in a row"
vArpu [v?rpu] "being full"
I hope this helps
Best

Jean-Luc Chevillard a ?crit :
In the case of (Classical) Tamil,
there is a group of 4 items to be considered:
la (?): transcribed "la" in Tamil Lexicon and popularly called "small 
la" (ci??a la) {cin_n_a la}
La (?): transcribed "?a" {l.a} in Tamil Lexicon) and popularly called 
"big la" [periya la]
Za (?): transcribed "?a" {l_a} in Tamil Lexicon (BUT a popular way of 
writing it in newspapers is "zh") [[This sound is considered by some as 
unique to Tamil]]
ra (?): transcribed "ra" in Tamil Lexicon and popularly called "small 
ra" (in order to distinguish it from ?a {r_a} (?, popularly called "big ra")
The Tolk?ppiyam, which is the earliest extant Tamil grammar
describes these four items in two s?tra-s: TE95 and TE96
