AW:Prasastapaada
28 06 08
Dr.Eli Franco is correct. Vindhyeshvariprasad was a great discoverer of manuscripts, also collector and editor. I do not know of exegetical works by him. There is also a correction to be made in the question. For, although we use the term for Prasastapaada's ?book on the Vaiseshika, there is no Prasastapaadabhaashya. The name of the book is Padaarthadharmasamgraha?

I am quite sure that this is the case. Dvivedin only edited the text.
