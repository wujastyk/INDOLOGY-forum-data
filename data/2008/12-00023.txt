Atharvaveda and its Paippalada ;Saakhaa
I would be interested to acquire the volume The Atharvaveda and its
Paippalada ;Saakhaa: Historical and Philological Papers on a Vedic
Tradition, edited by Arlo Griffiths and Annette Schmiedchen. Aachen: Shaker
Verlag, 2007. Geisteskultur Indiens: Texte und Studien, 11, Indologica
Halensis.
Does anyone know if this is still available and how can it be obtained?
Thanking you,
