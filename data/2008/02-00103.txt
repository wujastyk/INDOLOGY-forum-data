Gilbert Slater Reference Needed
Dear Scholars,
I am looking for a reference in the following book
"The Dravidian element in Indian culture" by Gilbert Slater originally  
published in 1924 and reprinted in 1976 and 1982. 
I would appreciate if anyone with access to the book could contact me  
off-list.
Sorry for cross-posting.
Thanks in advance.
Regards,
S. Palaniappan
