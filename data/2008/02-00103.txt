Message-ID: <161227082098.23782.6878715139944238060.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Dear Scholars,
 
I am looking for a reference in the following book
 
"The Dravidian element in Indian culture" by Gilbert Slater originally  
published in 1924 and reprinted in 1976 and 1982. 
 
I would appreciate if anyone with access to the book could contact me  
off-list.
 
Sorry for cross-posting.
 
Thanks in advance.
 
Regards,
S. Palaniappan
