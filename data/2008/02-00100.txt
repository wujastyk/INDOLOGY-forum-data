Sankara and the Authorship Issue
Dear Indologists,
I?m trying to find recent material  that deals with Sankara and the authorship
problem. I know the papers by Paul Hacker translated in _Philology and
Confrontation_. Any references on the topic since (or before) would be greatly
appreciated.
With thanks,
