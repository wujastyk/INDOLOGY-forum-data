Hi, everyone.

I've got a picture.
http://www.majhost.com/gallery/0479/mgs5/ag6-mgs2-flyer-e3-2001-copy.jpg

The background illustration is from Niklas M?ller's "Glauben, Wissen und
Kunst der alten Hindus".

I want your kind help for two things.
1. The original illustration(large enough to read the text in the picture).
2. The English translation of the text in the picture.

Thanks in advance.
And best wishes.
