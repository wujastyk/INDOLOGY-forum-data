For centuries Jewish women along India?s Malabar Coast filled
notebooks with
Jewish-themed songs they wrote and sang in Malayalam at weddings and
community celebrations and rituals. Indian, Israeli and American
researchers
aided a group of Cochin Israelis in restoring and bringing to modern
ears the
voices of their aunts and grandmothers. A performance by two of the
Nurit singers
and presentations by Indian and American scholars highlights the
program.
Program is free and open to the public
