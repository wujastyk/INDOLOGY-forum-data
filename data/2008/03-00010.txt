Early Inscribed Hero Stones in Tamil Nadu
Fair enough -- I agree I need to read the review before saying any  
more.  Still, I find it amazing that marginal people such as cattle  
rustlers (to use an Americanism) would have access to writing in any  
way at such an early date, whether the masons were literate or not.  I  
also appreciate your comment about the voiced/unvoiced letters.   
Whoever first adapted the Brahmi alphabet for Tamil had quite  
impressive linguistic insight and realized that two sounds (e.g. t and  
d) that are different in Sanskrit must be written the same in Tamil  
(tt is pronounced tt, while VtCV is has a voiced dental).  In Tamil,  
these are allophones.
