Kadamba
Thanks to all who answered my query.
There seem to be several Latin designations
for the same plant in this case.
The very useful Pandanus database
suggests "wild cinchona" as the English name,
but I am puzzled by this: "cinchona" generally
names several quinine-yielding species in
South America. Is it possible that, after
the invention of the gin and tonic, drunken
malaria victims began to see quinine bushes
everywhere?
