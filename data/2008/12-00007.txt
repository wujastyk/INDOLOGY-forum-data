Scan needed ~ Udanavarga pages
Dear Friends,
Does anybody have access to Vol I of Franz Berhard's edition of the 
Udaanavarga ?  Yet again, I find that this is another book that has 
mysteriously disapppeared from the SOAS Library collection.   If any kind 
soul could help, I need a scan of the few pages where he covers XXX.35-36 
(the udana beginning "ayo-ghana-hatasya .. ").  I would be indebted to 
anybody who could help !
Best wishes,
Stephen Hodge
PS:  Is this phenomenon of depleted library stocks especially unique to SOAS 
?  Every visit I make, I find that at least one out of every six books I am 
looking for has disappeared.   The security system is an absolute joke as 
probably every student knows how to by-pass it !
