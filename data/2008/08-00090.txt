Kadamba
Take a look at this:

According to the DED, Skt. kadamba is (not surprisingly) Dravidian --  
Tamil kaTampu, kaTampam, Telugu kaDambamu, etc.  It was worn by the  
veelan, a low-caste priest of Murugan, when he became possessed.  One  
wonders why the retroflex disappeared in Sanskrit -- perhaps the  
voicing of the -T- (stops are voiced in Tamil/Malayalam when they  
appear intervocalically) was heard more prominently than the  
retroflex.  The -T- retroflexed in all the Dravidian languages cited  
by DED.  It also gives a variant Sanskrit form, kalamba.
