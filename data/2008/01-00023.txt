For those with a little time on their hands and who wish to see how  
some of the artifact fiasco has played out, see this report posted  
some weeks ago (with multiple additional links) from a somewhat more  
unconventional news source/analysis than the local newspapers.   
Clearly the muddle is more than that.  But enough from me on this.
