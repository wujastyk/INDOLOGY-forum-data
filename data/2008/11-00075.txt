two queries
Dear all,
cordial thanks to Thomas Zumbroich (through Jan Houben), Stella Sandahl, Eugen Ciurtin, Jan Meulenbend, Allen Thrasher, Stephan Baums, Harry Falk, Jim Fitzgerald, Dominik Wujastyk, Harsha Dehejia, Stephen Hodge, George Hart, Jonathan Silk, Ashok Aklujkar, Joel Bordeaux, Ravindran Shriramachandran, John Huntingdon and all who have sent answers and comments on my two "ethnobotanical" queries. I could not imagine that the discussion stimulated by my posting will be so exhaustive and information so illuminating. It made a small bibliography and database - nice starting point (especially on betel/areca side).
