Dear Colleagues,
	I would like to you to attend the Second International Sanskrit  
Computational Linguistics Symposium and Sanskrit Library Workshop to  
be held at Brown University 15-17 May 2008.  The symposium opens with  
a keynote address by George Cardona entitled, "On the structure of  
P??ini?s system" and includes sessions on Modeling P??inian  
Grammar, Computational linguistic analysis, Semantics and  
Lexicography, and Automated manuscript collation and text-image  
alignment. The latter session includes presentations by leading  
researchers in Devanagari OCR technology (Thomas Breuel and Venugopal  
Govindaraju) and by Peter Robinson, designer of Collate and Edition  
critical edition software.  Please have a look at the program and  
other details at the Symposium website at the following address and  
bring it to the attention of interested scholars and students.
