Sanskrit Primers: R. Antoine's Sanskrit Manual
Dear Colleagues,
Good old Antoine! I think it is still relatively easy to get copies  
in India. Unfortunately, the one I used to have (in two volumes) was  
printed in India and was very difficult to read because of the so  
badly printed (and too small) devanagari script, not to speak of the  
many printing errors. But it was - and remains - a very thorough  
introduction to Sanskrit along with Kale's grammar (which suffers  
from the same printing defects).
There seems to be an amazing array of published and unpublished  
Sanskrit primers which I have been made aware of through kind  
communications from many colleagues. Mille grazie! Personally I would  
have liked to try out David Shulman's superb primer.  Unfortunately  
it is in Hebrew, and the English translation is not yet out.  Maurer   
caught my attention because it is amusing with chapters like "The  
mysterious gerund" and "The Romance of compounds" apart from being  
very well organized.
Coulson has too much transliteration, and since it is a teach- 
yourself-book, there is a key to all the exercises which is counter- 
productive in a class room. Killingley introduces the devanagari  
script only in lesson 23. Here in Canada, where more than half (and  
sometimes all) of the students are of Indian origin, a text book  
using so much transliteration will be perceived as arrogant Western  
neo-colonialism. And even the least gifted student usually learns the  
script in two weeks - that's when I stop transliterating.
There is no ideal text book out there - but there are many very good  
ones. All of them have their strong and weak points. As the grammar  
doesn't change from one year the only thing an instructor can change  
is the text book.
Best regards to all
