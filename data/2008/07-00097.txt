TECHNICAL> How to search the New DICT Monier-Williams Dictionary              from MS Windows et al.
[Apologies for cross posting]
Dear Colleagues,
I have received a number of queries from would-be-users of the new DICT
Monier-Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary. Some of you have been
having trouble installing the DICT server, client and Monier-Williams
database on your MS Windows machines.[*]
In this mail I will show how you can get `up and running' in as little
time as possible. Although the instructions below are written with
Windows users in mind, they are equally applicable to anyone, no matter
what computer platform you use -- Solaris, Linux, FreeBSD, Mac ...  All
that matters is that your computer should support Java.
BEGIN INSTRUCTIONS
1.) Download and install the Java application `jDictionary':
 http://jdictionary.sourceforge.net/download.html
 http://sourceforge.net/projects/jdictionary/
Windows users need: either `jdictionary-1_8-win-jre.exe' (incl. Java
Runtime Environment v1.4 (JRE))
                    or  `jdictionary-1_8-win.exe' (does _not_ incl. JRE
1.4)
UNIX(-like) users need: `jdictionary-1_8.zip'
2.) Start `jDictionary'
