Corpus topographicum Indiae antiquae : complete in 2 vols.?
It can be said that this University of 
Ghent/University of Louvain (Leuven) joint 
project will remain without conclusion/ further 
publications: A. Scharp? and P. Eggermont are 
dead, G. Pollet retired, and  the other ones are 
no longer in the Indological field.
With best wishes,
Christophe Vielle (Belgian Society for Indology)
