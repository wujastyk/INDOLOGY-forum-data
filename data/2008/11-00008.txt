Left and right
Yes, and in the Bhagavata Purana (10.53.27) likewise, Rukmini's "left
thigh, arm and eye trembled, indicating favor."  In this context, an
anxious bride, soon to be wed against her will to the infamous Sisupala,
worries that Krishna won't come to steal her because he has perceived some
flaw in her.  But as she waits... her body trembles, and then she sees the
brahmana bringing the good news that her beloved Krishna is indeed coming.
I never really understood the trembling, except that it bodes well.

PS. Monier Williams s.v. vama? notes:
    the quivering of the left eye or arm is supposed to be a good
    omen in women and of the left arm a bad omen in men
which reminds me that

    Okzidents und Orients, II: Weitere griechische und
    au?ergriechische Literatur und Volks?berlieferung. Berlin:

talks a bit about that aspect (Pischel provided the Indian
references). There are several twitches in Kalidasas Sakuntala,
including her right eye, which in context and contrary to MW seems
to be a good omen...
