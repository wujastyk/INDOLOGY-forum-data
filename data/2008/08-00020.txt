MAURER: The Sanskrit Language: An Introductory Grammar and              Reader
I can report an initial positive response from Routledge about a 
print-on-demand paperback edition of Maurer's primer.  Discussions are 
continuing, and final decisions and procedures have not yet been made, but 
things seem to be moving in the right direction.
