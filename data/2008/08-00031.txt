Parasara-Madhaviya Reference
I am trying to track down a reference from Kane's History of 
Dharmasastra to a passage from the Parasara-Madhaviya, specifically the 
Bombay Sanskrit Series edition by Vaman Sastri Islampurkar.  My library 
only has the Calcutta/Bibliotheca India edition by Tarkalankara.  Kane 
gives the citation as Vol. 2, Part 2, pp.206-207 (Prayascittakanda) and 
the passage in question from Madhava's commentary reads in part "nAyaM 
doSaH prAyazcittArthavAdatvena tadupayogAt...."  I would like to read 
the full context of this citation, but I cannot seem to find the passage 
in my edition.  If someone who happens to have the Bombay S.S. edition 
handy would kindly inform me which adhyaya this occurs in and/or which 
verse it is commenting upon, I should be able to find the full 
discussion in my edition.  Many thanks in advance for the help.
