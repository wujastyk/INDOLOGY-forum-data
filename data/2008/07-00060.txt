Phonetical descriptions (Skt and Tamil): the edge(s) of a              tongue in action (Re: Bows in ancient India
Dear Jean-Luc Chevillard,
Thanks so much for the reply.  One almost wishes the tongue were  
involved in shooting a bow!  It does seem clear that viLimpu generally  
means "edge." It also comes to mean "eyelid," which I suppose is  
conceived as the edge of the eye.  (Is there any similar term in  
Sanskrit?)  Your note is especially intriguing to me because it shows  
how Sanskrit and Tamil can be studied together to unearth new  
insights.  One area that badly needs study is the relationship between  
Tamil and Sanskrit esthetic theory and practice.  For example, Dandin,  
who may have been in the Pallava court, uses conventions and ideas  
that seem straight out of Tamil Sangam literature.  And Tamil  
conceptions and use of dhvani (uLLuRai) predate Sanskrit texts  
employing the concept by many centuries.  George Hart
