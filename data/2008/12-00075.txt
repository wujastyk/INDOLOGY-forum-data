The origin of -satva in bodhisatva may be satvan 'valiant' thematised like dharman>dharma. The Tibetan equivalents seem to support this. A?discussion in this line occurs in 'The preliminaries of the Vajraavalii' S.K.Pathak Felicitation volume S.P.Bhandar Kolkata, 2008. Unfortunately I have not yet got the book.

Ah. This may well be (without reading it of course I say nothing), but
irrespective of the history, *within Sanskrit* ?satva was, I think it is
fair to say, always understood as ?sattva; the question then is simply one
of orthography. But this is far from the only case in which degemination
occurs, another reason to uncouple the question of etymology/history from
that of orthography.
