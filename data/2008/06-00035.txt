A  Breakthrough ( Indus Symbols and Soccer)
The link below was brought to my notice just in time before Germany and Spain get to the Euro 2008 final in Vienna tonight. Not only are we presented here with the persuasive way in which modern-day scholars may put their case, e.g. an exemplary decipherment of Indus symbols to their core, but also - and most importantly - an extremely lucid presentation of the Indus culture as the centre of the soccer universe and of a subsequent, gradual cultural transfer of the game from India to the West. In light of the evidence, "Aryan invasion" theories must be considered refuted once and for all:

Ego ex animi mei sententia spondeo ac polliceor
me studia humanitatis impigro labore culturum et provecturum
non sordidi lucri causa nec ad vanam captandam gloriam,
sed quo magis veritas propagetur et lux eius, qua salus
humani generis continetur, clarius effulgeat.
Vindobonae, die XXI. mensis Novembris MCMLXXXIII.
