Dear Dominik,
I would be grateful if you would let people know about these two sites on
the CLS page that will be useful to students:
The first link contains a set of 17th cen. miniatures of the Rasamanjari of
Bhanudatta, as well as an important unpublished 18th century commentary on
his Rasatarangini:

The second link makes available a Newari ms. of the Uttararamacarita of
Bhavabhuta, one of the oldest mss. of a Sanskrit drama
http://www.claysanskritlibrary.org/volume-v-66.html
