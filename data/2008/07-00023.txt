Indologists!

   Although my last message was chock-full of Indological
content, there may be some who doubt that it was meant for
this list. So let all be assured that if there is interest,
and with the publisher's full permission, we may try to make
some sort of updated version available to those who would
appreciate such an effort.

   I think Walter H. Maurer would be pleased.  In any case
I'm beginning to think that he wants to contact me from the
hereafter about *something*...!!

best,
Tim Cahill
