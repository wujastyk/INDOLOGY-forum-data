Buddhist universities
Dear Al,
I am sure there are many sources for this query but _Buddhist Monks and Monasteries of India: Their History and Their Contribution to Indian Culture_ by Sukumar Dutt springs immediately to my mind.  It might be helpful to your friend.  It is a little old but very informative.
Hope this is helpful,
