Spoken Sanskrit
Dear colleagues,
H. H. Hock studied spoken Sanskrit in the 1980s in U.P., in Lucknow  
and Varanasi, if I remember right. See his article  ?Spoken Sanskrit  
in Uttar Pradesh ? a sociolinguistic profile?, Journal of  
Orientology. Lokapraj?? vol. 2. Prof. N. S. R?m?nuja T?t?c?rya  
Felicitation Volume. Puri 1988, 1?24. There has been a small  
percentage of people giving Sanskrit as their language in every  
census, but often it seems to be "father tongue" rather than "mother  
tongue".
Regards,
Klaus
