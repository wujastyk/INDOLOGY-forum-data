subhasita [--> nyaaya] of Samkara
S's sentence na hi kukku.tyaa eka-de;sa.h pacyata, eka-de;sa.h prasavaaya
kalpate paraphrases what is elsewhere referred to as ardha-kukku.tii-nyaaya.
Kevalaananda Sarasvatii's Miimaa.saa-ko.sa part 2 p. 673, referring to
Tantra-vaarttika 4.1.7.14 p. 720 (I do not have access to the edn used at
present), indicates that the nyaaya must go back at least to  Kumaarila's
time. 
The ardha-kukku.tii-nyaaya overlaps in its intent with the
ardha-vai;saasa-nyaaya.

Has somebody already met the illustration used by Samkara on
Gaudap?da-K?rik? IV.12 ?it is not possible to imagine that a part of
a hen is being coked and that another part is lying eggs ??
