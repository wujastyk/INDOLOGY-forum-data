Dear Dominik, 
  This looks like a great new tool for Paninian studies. 
  I found that some texts can be downloaded from Intratext. Does this also apply to the Intratext Mahabhasya? 
  What do the P and R *exactly* stand for? For instance, when I click 1.1, I get a few lines the last of which, on my screen, is: 
   
  (P 1) P I.1.1 - 5  R I.1 - 4 {10/10} agne ay?hi v?taye iti
   
  Apparently, sandhi has been undone, but the a- of aayaahi should have been long. 
  Since this is the Paspa;saahnika, I assume P I.1.1 does not mean that it is the Mahabhasya on Paa.nini's I.1.1 v.rddhir aadaic. So P is not Paa.nini but what does it mean? Probably P and R refer to some edition, but which ones?
  Best, 
  Jan

  Thanks to the staff and funding at the intratext.com project, and to the 
original data-analysis and data-entry project under Prof. Cardona, the 
Mahabhasya of Patanjali is now available with the Intratext coding:

This makes the generation of KWIC indexes trivially easy, as well as 
providing various statistical and lexical analyses of the text.

Best,
