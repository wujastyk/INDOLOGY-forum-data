Dear all,

maybe FRANCE is virtuous, after all.

The tendency (here, in France)
has been to recruit rather frequently
scholars who are not French citizens
in a number of permanent positions
[i.e. postes de "fonctionnaires" (alias "civil servants")]
at the CNRS ["Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique"]
at the EFEO ["Ecole Fran?aise d'Extr?me Orient"]
at the EPHE ["?cole Pratique des Hautes ?tudes"]
at the EHESS ["?cole des Hautes ?tudes en Sciences Sociales"]

So maybe the Kaliyuga does not apply to France ... :-)

Best wishes

P.S. it would however be nice to find out
what the precise situation of India is.

P.S.2
 it would also be nice to have a description
of the situation in the other (so-called) Western countries.
