saptaratna (navaratna)
Dear colleagues,
I am interested in the concept of 7 (or 9) 'jewels' denoting certain
standard lists composed of people and insignia at the king's court,
as e.g. in Mahaavastu I.49 (ed. Senart):
tasya imaani sapta ratnaani abhunsu | sayyathiida.m cakraratna.m
hastiratna.m a;svaratna.m
ma.niratna.m striiratna.m g.rhapatiratna.m parinaayakaratnam eva
saptama.m
I have hitherto failed to find good examples of this meaning of
saptaratna in brahmanical texts, nor am I aware of any discussions of
this list (or similar lists) in secondary literature.
I would be very grateful for references.
