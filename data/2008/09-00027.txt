mdzes-'byor may very well translate the term/name ullAsa (incl. connotations such 
as splendor, brightness, beauty) itself.  
Here is a map showing a lot of rivers in Maharashtra:

Dear Ashok (and George),

Thanks for the information.  That is somewhat helpful.  The thing is, I am 
trying to identify a river somewhere between and including the Narmadaa and 
the Ulhas from a Tibetan translation (mdzes-'byor) which roughly means 
"endowed with beauty / prosperity / goodness".  I had wondered if the Ulhas 
was at some time known as the Kalyaa.nika in view of the town upstream today 
called Kalyana.

Many thanks,
Stephen Hodge
