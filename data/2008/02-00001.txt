Indian Hoopoe
Greetings--
Apologies for cross-posting.
Can anyone clarify for me whether there are Sanskrit and Pali terms  
that are unique to the Indian Hoopoe (bird)?
I have come across a (Jataka) translation that provides Hoopoe for  
the Pali singila (Skt. zRGgin), and I'm wondering if that is accurate/ 
specific to the Hoopoe.
Any help would be appreciated.
Thanks,
Stuart
