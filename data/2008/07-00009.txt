1. NEW VOLUMES NOW AVAILABLE
<http://www.claysanskritlibrary.org/volumes.php?show=7>

Two new volumes of the ?Maha?bh?rata? are now available to
order: ?Preparations for War? (volume one), which contains a
fascinating philosophical passage, the Sanat?sujat?yam that
parallels the ?Bhagavad Gita,? translated engrossingly by Kathleen
Garbutt, and Adam Bowles?s gripping conclusion of ?Karna?
(volume two).

Patrick Olivelle?s ?Life of the Buddha? includes an incisive
study which shows how Ashva?ghosha elegantly subsumed the mainstream
Brahmanical ideology within a Buddhist discourse.

Life of the Buddha
<http://www.claysanskritlibrary.org/Life-Buddha-v-48.html>
by A?vagho?a OUT NOW
<http://www.claysanskritlibrary.org/order.php>
Patrick Olivelle

A poetic composition of the highest order, though the main aim is
not to entertain but to instruct, to present the Buddha?s teaching
as the culmination of the Brahmanical tradition. His wonderful
descriptions of the lovely bodies of the courtesans are ultimately
meant to show the transience of beauty.

Foreword by Gurcharan Das

At the beginning of ?Preparations For War,? the P?ndavas have
just completed their thirteen year exile, most recently having lived
in disguise and in humiliating service in Vir?ta?s city. The
P?ndavas believe they have completed the terms of their exile, though
Dury?dhana claims that they did not manage to live unknown for the
full thirteenth year, since ?rjuna was recognized in the battle at
the end of the preceding book, ?Vir?ta.? This first volume of
?Preparations For War? sees the P?ndavas and Kurus gathering arms
for the coming war and making preparations to fight.

?Karna? tells the events that occurred during the mighty hero
Karna?s two days as general of the K?urava army. The second volume
of ?Karna? resumes on the war?s seventeenth and penultimate day.
This will be a momentous day for the Bh?rata clans and especially for
a number of their most distinguished heroes, with some of the epic?s
most telegraphed events reaching their climax.

2. CSL TOP TEN SELLERS
With so many volumes in our series, readers new to Sanskrit literature  
may wonder where to begin. The dilemma can be particularly pertinent  
with the ?Maha?bh?rata.? As Vaughan Pilikian writes in his  
concise introduction
<http://www.claysanskritlibrary.org/about_mahabharata.php>, the  
?Maha?bh?rata? ?cannot be read like a normal book from
cover to cover, from beginning to end; one can and should begin
reading anywhere.? If the array of book excerpts
<http://www.claysanskritlibrary.org/excerpts.php>
and Translators? Insights
<http://www.claysanskritlibrary.org/insights.php>
are not enough to help you make up your mind, you might be
interested to know what other people are reading by checking out the
*CSL top ten sellers*
<http://www.claysanskritlibrary.org/press/CSLtop10.pdf>, compiled by  
New York University Press.

It is not only conventional lovers of Sanskrit literature who have
been espousing CSL books. With an elegant, recently redesigned format
bound in a compact size and wrapped in a striking jacket, our books
can be the perfect fashion accessory and travel companion. A *recent

in the Daily Telegraph, a British national newspaper, features a CSL
