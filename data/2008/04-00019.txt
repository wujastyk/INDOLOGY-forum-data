On 4/4/2008 I wrote:
I have been informed by the publisher that the actual suggested list 
price of the book has been US$62.00 for some time now (as found the last 
four Columbia University Press catalogs). They are taking steps to 
straighten out the unfortunate price discrepancies that have appeared 
online. They and I apologize for any confusion this may have caused.

P.S. In these dark times, $62 for an 800+pp. hardbound volume is still 
quite a good price, I think. And, if I may say so, the entire series 
(Treasury of the Buddhist Sciences) offers high-quality scholarship on 
Indic Buddhist literature, hardbound, for remarkably good prices:
