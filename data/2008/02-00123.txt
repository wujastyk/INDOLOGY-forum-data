(the two popular editions of the "devotional" 
version referred to infra, and Neve's translation 
of the possible "other" version = Jones version + 
four supplementary verses numbered 2, 5, 8, 10, 
from one Paris ms), it appears that we have 
rather here different recensions of the same text.

There is a text different from the "Bhaja 
Govindam" hymn also called "Mohamudgara". I may 
be wrong but it seems to me that it is a more 
recent phenomenon to call "Bhaja Govindam" by 
this name, too (which is rather confusing). While 
"Bhaja Govindam" is clearly a devotional hymn 
(and longer), the "other" Mohamudgara is not 
devotional at all (shorter, but with a differing 
number of verses in the manuscripts).
