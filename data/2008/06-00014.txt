In a 1997 JAOS article Kamil Zvelebil mentions that he is preparing a  
translation of the Tamil version of the Vikramacarita, the  
Muppattirantu patumai katai or 'Tales of the thirty two statues'. Does  
anyone know if this has been published yet? My searches of various  
library catalogues have turned up nothing.

Thanks,

Will
