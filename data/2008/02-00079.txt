Caurapancasika miniatures
Does anyone happen to know whether the illuminated manuscript of Bilhana's 
Caurapancasika from the Gujarat Museum Society, Ahmedabad which was 
reproduced in black-and-white in B.S. Miller's "Phantasies of a Love-Thief" 
(New York, 1971), has ever been published (or is available on the web) in 
color?
Thanks
