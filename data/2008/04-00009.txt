>Christophe Vielle and Peter Wyzlic have already given very useful
>bibliographic information. The former has also pointed out how we have an
>essentially single composition known with two names.
>
>The composition is also spoken of as Dvaada;sa-pa;njarikaa and
>Carpa.ta-pa;njarikaa.
>
>It is preserved in a popular tradition as well as scholarly tradition. I
>have seen pamphlet editions as well as inclusion in such publicatiions as
>the multi-volume ;Saa:nkara-granthaavalii. Cassettes carrying its renditions
>by outstanding singers such as M. S. Subbalakshmi and M. Balamuralikrishna
>are still sold in India.
>
>Several of its verses can be used to strengthen the students' knowledge of
>Indian scripts. Students beginning their study of Sanskrit benefit much by
>reading and hearing it (especially in the renderings of Subbalakshmi and
>others) after they have learned the basics of Devanagari (or other
>Brahmi-derived scripts).
>
>It is inaccurate to characterize the composition, even in its Bhaja Govindam
>version, as devotional. It is not a praise of or invocation to any
>particular god. The word stotra applied to it does not fit in the strong or
>literal sense of the word and may even be based on shaky manuscript evidence
>(earlier or more reliable mss may simply have Moha-mudgara.h,
>Dvaada;sa-pa;njarikaa or Carpa.ta-pa;njarikaa). The message throughout is
>that of (a) impermanence of all things and (b) the need for detachment and
>renunciation (a forcefully and beautifully delivered message). For the
>Advaitin, Govinda is simply a prop for brahman (although ;Sa:nkara could
>have written at least some of the moving devotional hymns ascribed to gods
>such as Govinda).
