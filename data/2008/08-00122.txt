Navarang and the rainbow
I know of two major references to the navrang in Hindu symbolism (NOT  
my speciality) and one in Buddhism which is closely related to one of  
the Hindu ones.
In the following I have no sense of the history or evolution of the  
usage
In addition I would be very interested to Learn more for other  
members of the list

In Hinduism, the navrang refer to the nine colors of the gemstones   
associated with the Nava graha (nine planets)
these are:
Planet:			modern association			ancient association
Sun Surya 		= Ruby					Ruby
Moon Chandra 		= Pearl					Pearl
Mars Mangala 		= Red Coral				Coral
Mercury Budha 		= Emerald					Emerald
Jupiter Brihaspati (Guru) = Yellow Sapphire		Topaz
Venus Shukra	 	= Diamond				Diamond
Saturn Shani 		= Sapphire					Sapphire
Rahu 			= Garnet (Hessonite)			? probably Lapis Lasuli
Ketu 			= Cat's Eye (Chrysoberyl)		? probably Go-medha Sacrifice  
(essence) of a cow
There is a frequently sought after astrological talisman that has a  
set of all of these stones which is touted heavily by Jewelers all  
over Indic and SE Asia.
A second reference is that the Navratna refers to the beginning of  
the Gayatri Mantra

"While Om, Bhuh, Bhuvah, Swaha, Thath, Savithur, Varenyam, Bhargo and  
Devasya are said to be its nine colors or praise of the Divine,  
Dheemahi is related to meditation and Dhiyo, Yo, Nah and  
Prachodayaath are said to be the parts of the prayer aspects of the  
mantra."
The mongol-Tibetan complex of religions reports a similar set to the  
Navagraha given above"
Nine colors in Tibet & Mongolia
?nine gems," gold, silver, coral, pearls, lapis lazuli, turquoise,  
steel, copper, and mother-of-pearl, were ground up for use as  
pigments and the sutra was written in the nine colors on black paper  
in a fine calligraphic hand

A very modern reference that is making its way into the astrological  
dialogue is the following list:
1) Ultraviolet, 2) violet, 3) blue, 4) blue-green, 5) green, 6)  
yellow, 7) orange, 8) red, and 9) infrared.
As is obvious, this is simply the adaptation of modern color theory  
into the ancient art of Astrology
