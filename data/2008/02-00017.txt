Dear Stella -- does this help at all ?

Andre Couture, "Birds in Sanskrit Literature de K. N. Dave: un index 
sanskrit-latin-anglais-francais", in Bulletin d'Etudes Indiennes, no. 16 
(1998), pp. 179-229.*

*following Elfrun Linke, "Birds in Sanskrit Literature: Sanskrit-English 
Index", in Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, no. 78 
(1997), pp. 121-141.

All the best,

Simon Brodbeck
