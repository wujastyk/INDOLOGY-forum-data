cha
Dear friends
I am seeing, for long,  this 'Cha'' in our own inherited collection of
dvaita and Nyaya manuscripts from North Karnataka and wondering what it
means. the answer, corraborated with other elder scholars, seems to be
simple. it is to indicate the end of section/text/chapter etc. It is a
common in manuscripts found in our region although it is not so common in
MSs found in sother regions like Tamilnadu or Kerala.
In the MS of Vyutpattivada, I am using for my critical edition at present
given to me by one of my friends from the same region, uses the Cha with
high freqency that every niranka patra (side of a leaf as it is called by
us) has nearly two three Chas to indicate the completion of debate on
particular subject.
thanks
