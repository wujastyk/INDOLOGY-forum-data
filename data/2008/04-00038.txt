  Hope you're doing well.
I have a question - do you have texts of Vedic samhitas with acarya
commentaries? Madhva supposedly wrote Rigveda bhasya (to some texts).
I'd like to know if Rv 1.164.31 what said in sanskrit? About one text in three places of Atharvaveda (6.22.1, 9.10.22, 13.3.9
- here it has a different end). What is its proper translation?
Thanks in advance,
 Jan Mares
