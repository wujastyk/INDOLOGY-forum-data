Message-ID: <161227082312.23782.6259246773465378460.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Does anyone have more detailed contact information for this institution than the following, from the online World of Learning:

Jayaswal, K. P., Research Institute
Patna 800001
Dir: Jata Shankar Jha (Dr )

A patron would also like email and telephone number and a more detailed street address.  The more recent books the LOC has received from it have no more detailed address.


Thanks,

Allen
