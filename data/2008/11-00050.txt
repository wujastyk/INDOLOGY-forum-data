two queries
With ref. to Prof. Hart's note on Cilapptikaram, the mention of betel leaves occurs in two places one is Cil. 16, 55 where Kannaki offers betel leaves and areca nut in a roll to Kovalan? after a meal, I am not able to remember the second instance. Thambulam is also mentioned in Manimekhalai 28. 243. where betel leaves with a camphor mixture (?????? - pa?itam ) is offered .

Re: two queries
I remember reading decades ago a reference in a Buddhist text--which I
*think* I remember to have been in Pali, of a man offering betel to a woman
as a sexual overture. Perhaps it would not be so difficult now for someone
to dig out the passage (if my memory of this is not as defective as it seems
to be becoming in many other things!). But whether the Pali was canonical,
and what the date of the text in question was, I have no idea at all...
