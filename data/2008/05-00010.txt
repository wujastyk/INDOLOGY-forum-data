Courtesans
Here is another item on courtesans, which I think has not yet been noted:
Doris M. Srinivasan, "Royalty's Courtesans and God's Mortal Wives: Keepers 
of Culture in Precolonial India."
In M. Feldman and B. Gordon, eds., The Courtesan's Arts: Cross-Cultural 
Perspectives (OUP 2006), pp. 161-81.
