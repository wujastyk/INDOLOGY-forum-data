Subject: Bodhivisa a placename?
Message-ID: <161227081732.23782.6217547446537575074.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

A colleague of mine is translating a Tibetan text into English.  
Evidently there is a placename Bodhivisa, a place in "southern 
regions".  Does anyone has any suggestions about identifying this name 
or place?
