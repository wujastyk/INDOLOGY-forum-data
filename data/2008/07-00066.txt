Subject: Sanskrit utaaho, aaho,              Pali udaaho and Sanskrit/Pali disjunction in general
Message-ID: <161227082960.23782.17823517276976046266.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Does anyone know of any studies of Sanskrit _utaaho_, _aaho_; Pali _udaaho_; and/or studies of disjunction in Sanskrit/Pali in general? What I've found is limited largely to Speijer's _Sanskrit Syntax_. (I note that Jared Klein has a couple of things on Skt. _uta_, _ca_, _u_, which are useful, but not quite what I'm looking for).

With many thanks,
