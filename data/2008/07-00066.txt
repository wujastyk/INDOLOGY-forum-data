Sanskrit utaaho, aaho,              Pali udaaho and Sanskrit/Pali disjunction in general
Does anyone know of any studies of Sanskrit _utaaho_, _aaho_; Pali _udaaho_; and/or studies of disjunction in Sanskrit/Pali in general? What I've found is limited largely to Speijer's _Sanskrit Syntax_. (I note that Jared Klein has a couple of things on Skt. _uta_, _ca_, _u_, which are useful, but not quite what I'm looking for).
With many thanks,
