chinese garment (cinas=?UTF-8?Q?=C4=81=E1=B9=ADaka)?=
Dear All,
in a Buddhist law commentary (Vajirabuddhi's Ga??hipada; terminus  
post quem 5th century, terminus ad quem 12th century), possibly of  
South Indian origin, the author compares a robe made of single woven  
patches
with a "Chinese garment" (cinas??aka?, v.l. c?na-). Later  
commentators (Sinhalese) have the same description, but drop the  
comparison with the Chinese garment. This is the only reference for  
cinas??aka I came across.
I would be grateful for  any information about "Chinese garments" or  
about the method to make robes from separately woven patches.
Best wishes for 2009.
