Thanks for bringing all this up Michael. 

It looks like the few years may allow me to expand my Indological?and linguistic studies to include Tamil. Can you point me to some references to the issues  you mentioned that still need to be addressed so I can keep them in mind as I study?

Best,

Dean Anderson
