Digital Kielhorn
Do you mean, Reinhold, that you can't download these Kielhorn volumes? 
I'm in the USA at the moment, and I used the "advanced search" 
books.Google.com screen, and ticked "full view" so that I would only see 
books that were wholly downloadable.  As a result, I have been able to 
download these volumes in toto.
I know there are sometimes different permissions when using google from 
countries outside the USA.  I have in the past had success overcoming 
these limitations by connecting to Google through an anonymizing proxy 
server (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server).
Best,
Dominik
