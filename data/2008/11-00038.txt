two queries
Dear Yaroslav Vassilkov,
here are two pages with photos (not very good ones, I am afraid):
http://www.tuninst.net/MyanMedPlants/TIL/famC/Combretaceae.htm#Terminalia-bellerica
http://dv.wikipedia.org/wiki/%DE%84%DE%AA%DE%83%DE%AE%DE%85%DE%A8
There must also be an out?of?copyright botanical book with good
drawings on the web somewhere. I do not know whether the nuts
(berry seeds?) received any special treatment before being used as
?dice? (whence presumably your interest, though I see they also
figure in ?yurveda).
Best regards,
