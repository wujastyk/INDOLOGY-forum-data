bodhisattva/bodhisatva
The Tibetan for bodhisat(t)va would be relatively late, and could reflect
later folk etymologies. The Chinese, for many centuries before the Tibetan
translations, used the transcription pusa ??, an acrostic-type
abbreviation for puti ?? + saduo ?? (bodhisattva => puti-saduo => pusa).
They translated sattva (alone or in compounds such as bodhisattva, or
mahAsattva ????) as ?? zhongsheng, lit. multitude of living (things),
or ?? youqing, lit. having feelings (i.e., sentient being).
As the 7th c. (early Tang) Buddhist dictionary by Huilin explains:
"Sattva [saduo] = transcription from Sanskrit. In current Chinese (i.e.,
Sui-Tang period) youqing (sentient being); in older translations zhongsheng
(multitude of living things), which misses the right meaning."
??(???????????????????)
Yiqie jing yin yi (Sounds and Meanings of all [Words] in the Sutras) ???
??, fasc. 12; T.54.2128.382a12.
The number of "t"-s seem immaterial; the meaning (whichever of the Chinese
equivalents one prefers) is plainly for sattva, not satva(n).
