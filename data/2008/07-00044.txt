Bows in ancient India
Dear Prof. Tieken,
This is indeed an excellent suggestion, and I thank you.  As with any  
of the possible meanings I have uncovered, it has some problems.  In  
viLimpu kaTTutal, the word viLimpu refers not to the wrist, as you  
know, but to the edge of the wound (edge, of course, is one of the  
meanings of viLimpu).  The word uriiiya (wear away, rub) would,  
however, go very well with the notion of wrist -- I myself remember  
wearing a wrist guard when practicing archery as a child.  The other  
possibility I have come up with is that viLimpu might refer to the  
area on the bow which the arrow rubs as it goes by (right above the  
grip).  Here, viLimpu might make more sense, as it is in some way the  
edge of the bow (while it's a stretch to make "edge" mean "wrist").   
In Akam 281 we have vaan pooz val vil cuRRi noon cilai av vaar  
viLimpiRku amainta ....kaNai.  The first part of this is quite unclear  
bow (vil)" -- for shooting?  Or perhaps for carrying?  The second  
part: "the arrow that is fitted to (or lies against, as you suggest)  
the fine, long (or straight) viLimpu of the powerful bow (cilai)."  
This raises a couple of questions: is a vil the same as a cilai, or  
are they possibly two different kinds of bow?  Second, it seems to say  
quite clearly that the viLimpu belongs to the bow (cilai), as there is  
no other apparent way to construe "cilai."  This would seem to  
preclude your otherwise excellent suggestion of "wrist,"  though of  
course I remain open to any clarification.  I'm posting this on the  
Indology list to express my thanks for your suggestion and to see  
whether our discussion might occasion more responses.  George Hart
