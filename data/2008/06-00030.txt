translations of Prasastapada Bhashya with Commentary Nyayakandali              of Sridhara
Greetings All:
	How does Vindhyesvari?prasada Dvivedin's translation of Prasastapada  
Bhashya with Commentary Nyayakandali of Sridhara compare to  
Ganganatha Jha's? I have the latter but not the former.
thanks in advance for your thoughts on this,
Deepak
