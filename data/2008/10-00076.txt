sati
Reas Shiva PUrana where  Daksha - father of Parvati plunged intto the sacred
jajna fire after listening the insult of her husband Shiva. This is also
sati.
 Another  stanza in  Vedic strotra is that  while a wife isjumping to the
funeral pyre afterher husband's death , her husbands brother is telling her
not todo so.
There  itis called  sahagamini- those who go in the same path with their
husband. Sat-jumpinginto the fire to save chestity  was called jaharvrata in
Rajasthan, when Allahuddin Khilji wanted to see Padmini-thequeen of Chitor,
many Kshatriya women pluinged in to the fire maintain their chestity.
Sati  is also need to befound from the icons of archeology.Manyplaces of
Indian archeology contains sati stones, sati ponds,Basil( tulasi) tree
represent the sati- so the tree iscalled sati tulasi( Mythof Vrindavati
goddess and Jalandhar  demon).Sati system is connected with  the Indian
tradition insuch a way that ,justfifteen days agoI found  somewhere in India
 an eighty  years old woman wanted to be satiwith her deceased husband.
Cliford Geartz,in his book local knowledge has discussed how sati systemw as
in  Bali.
It is good to study Indian written tradition, but it has also a folk
tradition, that need to be studied.
