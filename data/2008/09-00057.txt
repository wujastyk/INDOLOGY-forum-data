I am looking for the contact information of Matthew Clark, author of

The Dasanami-Samnyasis: The Integration of Ascetic Lineages Into an 
Order, 2006, published by Brill Academic Publishers.

The book jacket says he is currently an independent scholar, so I'm 
presuming he is not at present affiiliated with any university 
department. An offline response would be appreciated. My email ids are 
vidya.s at ge.com and svidyasankar at gmail.com.

Thanks,
Vidyasankar Sundaresan
