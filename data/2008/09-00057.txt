Matthew Clark address
The following request was received by the INDOLOGY Governing Committee. 
Any replies should be made off-list, please.
<vidyasankar.sundaresan at GE.COM>
I am looking for the contact information of Matthew Clark, author of
The Dasanami-Samnyasis: The Integration of Ascetic Lineages Into an 
Order, 2006, published by Brill Academic Publishers.
The book jacket says he is currently an independent scholar, so I'm 
presuming he is not at present affiiliated with any university 
department. An offline response would be appreciated. My email ids are 
vidya.s at ge.com and svidyasankar at gmail.com.
Thanks,
Vidyasankar Sundaresan
