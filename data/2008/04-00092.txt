AW: "GRETIL e-library" now open
My pleasure. The Colebrookes formed one of those dynasties in East 
Indian service, and commonly get confused. The index to the first volume 
of proceedings of the Asiatic Society in Calcutta thoroughly mixes up 
the Sanskritist Henry Thomas Colebrooke with his cousin Robert Hyde 
Colebrooke, who was surveyor-general of Bengal (and the uncle and also 
father-in-law of William Macbean Colebrooke of Ceylon fame). Henry 
Thomas also sometimes gets attributed the title of his elder brother, 
Sir (James) Edward, and also the misdeeds that caused the latter's 
dismissal as Resident of Delhi. My husband and I hope to unravel this 
web in our forthcoming biography of Henry Thomas, which is nearing 
completion.
All best wishes,
Rosane Rocher
