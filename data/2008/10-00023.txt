Sanskrit and Tamil question
I find it hard to believe that it has been "demonstrated" that  
Dravidian and Australian languages have "certain words" in common --  
though apparently some inhabitants of South India share a y-chromosome  
with the aborigines (no doubt they were part of a population that  
emigrated from Africa to Australia 50,000 years ago).  After all, it  
is well known that completely unrelated languages have many words that  
look related but are not.  I would be very interested if Prof. Witzel  
could share this paper or make it available if at all possible.   
Certainly any relationship that could be convincingly established  
would be important.  50,000 years is a very long time -- certainly,  
genes might persist, but it's hard to believe that any element of  
language could be preserved all those years.  And of course there is  
the question of whether Dravidian even originated in South India.
Of course, nadii is IE.  The Tamil word for "walk" is naTa, with a  
retroflex T.  George Hart
