books on Gupta inscriptions, Nepal
None of these scholars has written an independent book on the Licchavi inscriptions. However, there are a lot of publications of theese scholars in now defunct journals, namely Purushartha, Sam.skr.ta-sandesha and Itihaasa-prakaasha and still running PuurNimaa, all published from Kathmandu.
