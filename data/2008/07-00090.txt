Dear Colleagues,

The Nepalese-German Manuscript Cataloguing Project (NGMCP) is pleased  
to announce the sixth issue of the _Newsletter of the NGMCP_.   PDF  
versions of the Newsletter are now available at the University of  
Hamburg website:

http://www.uni-hamburg.de/ngmcp/newsletter_e.html

As usual, there are two versions: full and light.  The full version is  
about 9.1 MB, and the light version is about 1.6 MB.  The difference  
is in the quality of the graphics.

Please be reminded that we plan to produce hard-copies of the issue in  
the near future.  Those who requested hard-copies of preceding issues  
will automatically receive them.  We continuously accept new requests.
