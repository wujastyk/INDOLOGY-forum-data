Electronic version of Mani's Puranic Encyclopaedia
Dear Colleagues,
on the NITAAI Veda web-site ("The comprehensive Vedic knowledge 
Base", "compiled by devotees of lords Nityananda Gauranga"), there is 
a nearly complete electronic input (without diacritics, and many 
misprints) of the English version of Ve.t.tam Maa.ni's Puranic 
Encyclopaedia (originally published in Malayaa.lam). See
http://nitaaiveda.com/All_Scriptures_By_Acharyas/Puranas/Puranic_Encyclopedia/
With best wishes,
Christophe Vielle
