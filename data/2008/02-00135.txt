I am somewhat confused by your comments Reinhold. It goes without
saying that the IeB version of the MBh  -- and of the Ramayana -- is
derivative. This would be obvious to all users and is clearly
acknowledged on the site whenever the text is cited, e.g.:
``Mah?bh?rata - Book I: Philologica Indica et Buddhica transcript  ::
[word count] [mbh-01-tei5]. Base edn: Bhandarkar Oriental Research
Institute. Base e-texts: Muneo TOKUNAGA, John SMITH, Bhandarkar
Oriental Research Institute, et al.. Conversion to TEI markup: Richard
MAHONEY.''
Likewise credit is given in the headers:
``The author would like to express his deep gratitude to Prof. Dr Muneo
TOKUNAGA and Dr John SMITH for permitting him to produce a TEI version
of their base e-texts and for allowing the TEI version to be publicly
searchable.''
As indicated my own contribution in all this is to have marked up the
MBh &c. according to the guidelines of the Text Encoding Initiative
(TEI) (http://www.tei-c.org/) and then to have provided a full text
search, retrieval, and analysis system for the TEI version.
I am a little perplexed. Have I missed something?
By all means. I look forward to your comments.
Kind regards,
 Richard
