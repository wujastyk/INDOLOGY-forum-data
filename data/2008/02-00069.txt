Rasa
Dear Indologists,
I?m in need of suggestions for introductory readings on Rasa. It is for a
philosopher with a research project in aesthetics but who has no knowledge of
classical Indian languages.
I would be most grateful for references to authoritative introductory survey
material dealing with Rasa (particularly theoretical material), and any English
translations of important texts on the topic.
Many thanks!
