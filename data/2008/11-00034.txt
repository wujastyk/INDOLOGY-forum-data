Dear all,

One scholarship is available for a student 
to read a PhD in Buddhist Studies at Mahidol 
University in Thailand. I would appreciate 
it very much if you could kindly forward 
this email to those who are interested. 

The scholarship is set up by a generous lady 
who wants to provide an opportunity for a 
female candidate (could be a nun, maechi or 
laywoman, of any nationality) to read for a 
PhD in Buddhist Studies at Mahidol. 

To be eligible, the recipient must have met 
the University?s academic and English Language 
entry requirements and must first have been 
successful in gaining an unconditional offer 
of a place. This scholarship will cover all 
the tuition fees for five years. 

For further information, please contact 
me off-list.Thank you very much for your 
help.
Best wishes,
Pathompong Bodhiprasiddhinand, Bangkok
