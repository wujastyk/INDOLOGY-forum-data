books on Gupta inscriptions, Nepal
Thank you Mahes, yesterday I checked that (it's easy to find it in
international online libraries, thank God open and public). I need to know
in which books and journals (with biblio of course) they published
inscriptions or studies on them. Titles are a bit too generic.
Perhaps you know at least your father's publications.
All the best, and thank you again,
enrica
ps perhaps, since we know each other, you want to answer to my private
yesterday mail off list?
