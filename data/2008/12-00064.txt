questions on bodhisattva vow
Dear all,
Those of you who are interested in the concept of the king-like, boatman-like,
and herdsman-like bodhisattva or bodhicittotpaada, may consult my doctoral
dissertation published under the title: *The Resolve to Become a Buddha: A Study
of the Bodhicitta Concept in Indo-Tibetan Buddhism. Studia Philologica Buddhica,
Monograph Series 23. Tokyo: The International Institute for Buddhist Studies,
2007.* 
See particularly, pp. 267-271, where I discuss Tibetan sources including that of
Klong-chen-pa and Tsong-kha-pa and also attempt to trace Indian sources of the
concept. 
Best wishes,
Dorji Wangchuk
