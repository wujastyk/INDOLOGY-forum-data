Buddhacarita 1,1-7 and 25-40
[the title of this subject is borrowed from Michael Hahn's artice in 
IIJ 17, 1975]
Dear colleagues,
both in the electronic version by members of the Sanskrit Buddhist 
Input Project (available through GRETIL) and in Irma Schotsman's 
"edition" (Bibliotheca Indo-Tibetica Series, 1995) of A/svagho.sa's 
work, the missing portion of the Sanskrit text of the Buddhacarita is 
fully completed in the same manner. These conjectures are partly 
based on Johnston's ones (at least for vv. 1-7, given in the 
footnotes of his translation). But who is the author of this full 
restaured text ? And is this conjectural text a "serious " 
reconstruction based on the Tibetan translation ? Thank you for your 
comments,
Christophe Vielle
