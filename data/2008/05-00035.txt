Will in Sanskrit
And the other end of the spectrum from a "gu.na of the aatman", we have 
such behaviourist expressions as "chandata.h kriyaa" (Caraka "saa.1.140), 
"doing whatever one wishes".
Or again, Su"sruta ci.29.19:
  carati amoghasa.mkalpo devavac caakhila.m jagat/
  He travels the whole world with infallible will(power), like a god.
which Cakra glosses as "anivaaryasa.mkalpa.h", suggesting that sa.mkalpa 
didn't need explanation.
