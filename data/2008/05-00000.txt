INDOLOGY FAQ: teething problems
I'm sorry about the teething problems.
Those of you who decided to have a go at the FAQ found you couldn't create 
an account, even though there's a button saying you can.
Here's the way forward:
If you wish to have write-access to the INDOLOGY FAQ, please send a 
request to the INDOLOGY Committee at the usual address:
   indologycommittee at liverpool.ac.uk
Apologies for the clunkiness.  We have to do it this way so that we can 
restrict contributors to members of our forum.
One more thing:
The FAQ is for people to write potted but scholarly versions of their 
indological interest areas.  It's not just a collection of hot links to 
work elsewhere, though of course as in any Wiki, outbound links are 
welcome too, as part of the referencing.
Best,
Dominik
