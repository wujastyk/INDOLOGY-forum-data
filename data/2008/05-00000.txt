Subject: INDOLOGY FAQ: teething problems
Message-ID: <161227082521.23782.11121823539774810172.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

I'm sorry about the teething problems.

Those of you who decided to have a go at the FAQ found you couldn't create 
an account, even though there's a button saying you can.

Here's the way forward:

If you wish to have write-access to the INDOLOGY FAQ, please send a 
request to the INDOLOGY Committee at the usual address:

   indologycommittee at liverpool.ac.uk

Apologies for the clunkiness.  We have to do it this way so that we can 
restrict contributors to members of our forum.


One more thing:

The FAQ is for people to write potted but scholarly versions of their 
indological interest areas.  It's not just a collection of hot links to 
work elsewhere, though of course as in any Wiki, outbound links are 
welcome too, as part of the referencing.


Best,
Dominik
