Drum Example
oh, how interesting!  This thing about beating smeared drums for health 
occurs in the Susrutasamhita too, in a section of the Kalpasthana on 
curing poisoning that may affect a population as a whole.  The caustic 
paste is smeared on drums, banners and doorways in the town.
I mention this briefly in Roots of Ayurveda, 3rd ed., pp.78--9.
