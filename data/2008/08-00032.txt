Parasara-Madhaviya Reference
Don: it is in Prayascitta Kanda, 12th Adhyaya,  -- and section 
beginning with "atha karmavipAko nirpyate", and cited passage comes 
very early in this section. But really there is no verse to which 
this is a commentary; this is a long digression. If you cannot find 
it let me know and I can send you a xerox of these pages.
