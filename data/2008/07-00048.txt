Dear Mahendra,

I will forward your information to the editors.  There have been a few 
replies already.  The decision is not in my hands.  I am merely 
connecting the editors to Indologists who are interested in the book.  
They will send a copy of the book to the person who is chosen.

Best wishes,

George
