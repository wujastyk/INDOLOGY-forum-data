WH Maurer's Sanskrit grammar
Hi Loriliai!
   I've got Maurer's grammar on my hard drive. Been meaning
to convert it to a unicode font. The files I have are old MS
Word files generated by a Mac.  The devanaagari font would
have to be converted too. I hesistated to let the list know
this since I use printouts of the grammar on the Q.T.  Don't
want to publicly announce that I'm violating copyright! Of
course, when the book is virtually unavailable I feel pretty
self-righteous.
   How are things in Boulder? We're just back from
Pondicherry where I spent the sabbatical. Were you in India
this year?
best,
Tim
