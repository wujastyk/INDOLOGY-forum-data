Tantra questions: bija mantras and Woodroffe's reputation              today
Dear Mr Anderson,
I would like to suggest you to consult Varnabijaprakasa an authoritative book on Bijamantras written by Pt Sarayu P. Dvivedi,edited by Dr Paramahansa Misra,published by
Chowkhamba Surabharati Prakashan,Varanasi,INDIA.This book can help you in interpreting Bijamantras authentically.
As regards Mr John Woodroffe's repute books edited by him are really considered authoritative,but both Intellectual exercise and Tantric Sadhana are different things.
I understand this might be helping you.
Regards,
Sincerely

Tantra questions: bija mantras and Woodroffe's reputation today
I have a couple of Tantra questions.
Can anyone recommend good books on bIja mantras?
Second, what is the modern opinion about the early writings on Tantra by John
Woodroffe (Arthur Avalon)?
Best,
Dean
