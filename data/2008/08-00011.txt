Dear colleagues,

I was very interested to learn about Behaghel's law. I presume it is a  
general statement about the Indo-European family of
languages, which may be more or less verified for the various  
languages. Concerning Sanskrit, thanks to Ashok for providing the
reference, indeed justifying calling it this "Paa.nini-Behaghel" law.  
It is intriguing whether this "law" is merely a standardized
rhetorical device, or whether it is related to some information  
theoretic notion such as Huffman coding (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding 
) since it is likely that shorter words are more frequent than longer  
ones.
Some relation with sandhi-splitting ease could also exist (specially  
in light of Paa.nini 2.2.32 and 33).

Of course the law concerns only copulative compounds (dvandva). The  
problem arises when listing several authors of a paper.
The usual rule (of Western academics) is that authors are given in  
alphabetical order, only in case of balanced authorship.
Otherwise the authors are put in decreasing order of their respective  
contribution, and this is a fairer law than any syntactic
one.

Actually, vaarttikas recommend the fair law: first should be come the  
notion worthy of most respect, like in maatapitarau.
And of course braahma.nak.satriyavi.t"suudraa.h - br?hmans should  
always go first!

I hope you do not have problems with my transliteration scheme. I call  
it VH encoding. Velthuis is of course the primary author.
I merely restrict his code to lower case letters, using aa and not A  
etc. It would be unfair to call this the HV encoding because
of some obscure IE law ...

Cheers
GH
