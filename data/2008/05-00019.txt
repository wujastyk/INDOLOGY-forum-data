The same effect appears with Firefox on my Linux box.
When I open the source code of the HTML page (start page) I see e.g.
"Mah&Auml;?bh&Auml;?&aacute;&sup1;&pound;ya" for  
"Mah?bh??ya" (mahAbhAzya). That means, no UTF code but some  
obviously wrong html entities (&Auml; stands for big case umlaut-A,  
i.e. ?, &aacute; for ?, &pound; for the British Pound symbol and so  
on).  If this shows up correctly on other systems, there must happen  
something behind the scenes that works differently depending on the  
platform of the browser. Perhaps some kind of scripting code, or so,  
I guess. Does it work with Internet Explorer on Windows?
All the best
