In response to Prof. Kapstein's inquiry about the Madhyamakavatara digital edition posted by Digital Sanskrit Buddhist Canon site:

I have not looked at which edition this is, but I just want to add that there is also an older Sanskrit reconstruction of Madhyamakavatara and its Bhasya, along with some part's of Jayananda's sub-commentary to the Bhasya. It was produced by N. Aiyaswami Sastri in the 1930s (see bibliographical reference below). I have a pdf scan of these articles, and can be contacted off-list, if anyone should desire a copy. I would also like to make you aware that there now is a Sanskrit manuscript of Madhyamakavatara that is being prepared for publication in Vienna in collaboration with Chinese scholars from Beijing. 

 

  

sastri, n. aiyaswami (1929-1932): "the madhyamakavatara of candrakirti: chapter vi with the author's bha?ya reconstructed from the tibetan version", supplement to the journal of oriental research, madras oriental series no. 4, vol. iii part 4 (1929, pp. 1-8), vol. iv part 1 (1930, pp. 9-16), vol. v part 1 (1931, pp. 17-24), vol. v part 2 (1931, pp. 25-32), vol. v part 3 (1931, pp. 33-40), vol. vi part 1 (1932, pp. 41-48), vol. vi part 2 (1932, pp. 49-56), vol. vi part 4 (1932, pp. 57-64).

___________________ (1932-1933): "extracts from jayananda's commentary on the madhyamakavatara, chap. vi, retranslated into sanskrit from the tibetan version" in the journal of oriental research (not as a supplement), madras, vol. vi part 2 (1932, pp. 171-183), vol. vii part 1 (pp. 82-89) and vol. vii part 3 (1933, pp. 247-254).

Can anyone supply the precise source of the first five chapters
of the Madhyamakaavataara posted on the "digital
Sanskrit Buddhist canon" site and, I assume, gretil?

You may write to me off list if need be.
