Request for an Illustration from Early German work on Indian              myths (F. Wong)
Allen,
Niklas Muller's book seems to have been an important influence (and 
the source for Indic materials) for Johann Malfatti (1775-1859), 
described by Christian Kerslake as one of the "founding figures of 
modern occultism."
Kerslake's article is here:

The illustrations seem to be like those in Robert Fludd's and 
Athanasius Kircher's works. Was this just a common style?
