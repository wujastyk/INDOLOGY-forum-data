Allen,

Niklas Muller's book seems to have been an important influence (and 
the source for Indic materials) for Johann Malfatti (1775-1859), 
described by Christian Kerslake as one of the "founding figures of 
modern occultism."

Kerslake's article is here:

The illustrations seem to be like those in Robert Fludd's and 
Athanasius Kircher's works. Was this just a common style?
