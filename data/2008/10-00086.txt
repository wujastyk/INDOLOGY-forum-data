Medical History
If one includes in the Justinian plague the
entire plague cycle beginning in the time
of Justinian and lasting until about 750,
then you will find a reference in my
The Tibetan Assimilation of Buddhism, p. 42.

to 6th c., this will be a bit late, and
Tibet is not strictly speaking South Asia.
