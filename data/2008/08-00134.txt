Kadamba
An excellent listing, perhaps the best, of what botanical identifications
have been proposed for the kadamba is given by Meulenbeld in his 1974 book
The Madhavanidana (Brill 1974, reprinted Motilal Banarsidass 2008),
Appendix 4, pp.  535-6.  Meulenbeld leaves it to the reader to assess the
sources for the identifications (which he gives in extenso).  What is not
stated in Meulenbeld's book is that the various identifications in his
appendix on plant names are arranged broadly in order of his opinion of
their appropriateness.
As with all "bare" identifications, Meulenbeld's list does not provide the
reasoning, similarities, features, locations, historical anecdote or any
of the other bases for decision-making that are essential for thinking
about plant identities in a meaningful manner.  They are there in the
sources he cites, but that's an exercise left to the reader.
Best,
Dominik
NB there's an important addendum to Meulenbeld's Appendix 4, published as
a supplement to the book on Vrksayurveda by R. P. Das.
