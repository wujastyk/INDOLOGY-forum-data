JAINA SCRIPTURES AND JAINA PHILOSOPHY
(11th JAINA STUDIES WORKSHOP AT SOAS)
March 12-13
Brunei Gallery Lecture Theatre
School of Oriental and African Studies, Russell Square, London WC1H OXG
Research on the Jaina Agamas, once the main domain of Jainology and
Prakrit Studies, has become rare nowadays, while studies
of Jaina philosophy and religion based on sources in Sanskrit, Middle and
New-Indo-Aryan languages are increasing. The conference seeks to
reconnect research on canonical and non-canonical sources and their uses.
Contributions are invited.
