Post-Doc Research Fellowship (South Asian or East Asian              Studies) in Oslo
Dear members of the list,
I apologize for reposting the Post-Doc Fellowship message on the list, and
then passing on a private message. I did not see that Prof. Huesken's
original message went to the Indology list. 
Best regards,
Lars Martin Fosse
