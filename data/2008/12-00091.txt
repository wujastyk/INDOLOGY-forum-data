bodhisattva/bodhisatva
It should be noted that this type of degemination is not at all  
limited to Bauddha manuscripts.
It is the norm for words like "tattva" to be spelled "tatva" in almost  
every "Saiva manuscript I have seen, and at least one Naa.taka.
Most of these are from Nepal.  Perhaps someone with broader experience  
can comment if it reaches to other genres and regions as well.
