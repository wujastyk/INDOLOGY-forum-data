Sorry for inadvertently sending the message below to the whole list.

Dear Rosane,
Sorry to hear that. I did not remember your obituary on the list. It  
was actually sent to me by Elliot Stern, who also replied.
Having tried many text books for 1st year Sanskrit I was thinking  
giving his a try. Unfortunately, it seems to cost some $200 which I  
fear is far beyond our students' means.
Which 1st year Sanskrit do you think is the most effective? I would  
have liked to teach David Shulman's, but the translation isn't ready  
yet.
With best wishes to both of you
Stella
