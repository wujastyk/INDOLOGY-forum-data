"GRETIL e-library" now open
Many thanks for this great service to scholarship.
May I suggest a correction to the catalog of files? The article on toddy 
in Ceylon is not by Henry Thomas Colebrooke, who was a civilian. The 
author was (later Sir) William Macbean George Colebrooke, who had a 
distinguished military and administrative career in Sri Lanka, and later 
in the Caribbean.
All best wishes,
Rosane Rocher
