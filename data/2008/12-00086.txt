bodhisattva/bodhisatva
My son, Eric R. Huntington, is working on some Newar?Sanskrit Manuscripts that are vidhi?for ?the Vajradhatu?mandala. TheY?range fro 16th to 19th century and are all fairly good?Newar?Sanskrit. In them "bodhisattva" is 'usually' (Eric's?code for he is not 100% certain) with one t. He doesn't remember any with two t's
I would also point out that the mantras?for Vajrasattva?in the sources that I have looked into are always one t, (e.g., OM?VAJRA?SA TVA HUM as constructed in Tibetan script.)
As we are on a family holiday we are both away from our resources until January, so cannot carry this any farther at this time.?
What about in Pala?Manuscripts?
