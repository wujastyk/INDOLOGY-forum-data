Dear Mr Bhattacharya,
The Sanskrit word Bodhisattva is accepted by Buddhists also in Buddhist Sanskrit and is not a hybrid one.
The derivation of bodhi and sattva: 
<Budh +affix in by sarvadh?tubhya in(Un?di).Bodhi is a kind of Sam?dhi. 
Sato bh?vah sattvam. <as +satr=sat,sat+affix tva=sattvam.Sattvam dravye gun?e cite vyavas?yasvabh?vayoh? 
One who has strongly resolved for bodhi is bodhisattva..There may be some copyist?s 
mistakes in manuscripts.The author of Nyasa commentry on Kasika,too,is mentioned with the status of Bodhisattva and the term contains 'tt' there. 
Regards, 
Sincerely

The origin of -satva in bodhisatva may be satvan 'valiant' thematised
like dharman>dharma. The Tibetan equivalents seem to support this.
A?discussion in this line occurs in 'The preliminaries of the
Vajraavalii' S.K.Pathak Felicitation volume S.P.Bhandar Kolkata, 2008.
Unfortunately I have not yet got the book.

Ah. This may well be (without reading it of course I say nothing), but
irrespective of the history, *within Sanskrit* ?satva was, I think it is
fair to say, always understood as ?sattva; the question then is simply one
of orthography. But this is far from the only case in which degemination
occurs, another reason to uncouple the question of etymology/history from
that of orthography.
