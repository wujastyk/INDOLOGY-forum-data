Here are two important books. As far as I remember the 2nd volume of  
History of Sanskrit Poetics deals with rasa to a great extent.


Sanskrit poetics as a study of aesthetic. With notes by Edwin Gerow
De, Sushil Kumar
University of California Press 1963 118p.


History of Sanskrit poetics
     De, Sushil Kumar
K.L. Mukhopadhyay 1960
