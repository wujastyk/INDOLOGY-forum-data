Sanskrit utaaho, aaho,              Pali udaaho and Sanskrit/Pali disjunction in general
If you are interested in knowing, how traditional Skt linguists, studied the
phenomenon, my 1999 book _The Theory of Nip?tas (Particles) in Y?ska's
Nirukta_ (Pune: Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute) and its bibliography
may be useful. 
In addition, Tilaka's _Nip?tavyayopasarga-v.rtti_ (Tirupati:
Tirumala-Tirupati Devasthanams Press, 1951), possibly extracted from
K.siira-sv?min's works, and V. Srivatsankacharya's _ Avyaya Kosa: A
Dictionary of Indeclinables_ (Madras: The Samskrit Education Society, 1971)
should be helpful.
