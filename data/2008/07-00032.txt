Dear Colleagues,

I am pleased to announce the publication of a new book, _Yoga in the Modern 
World: Contemporary Perspectives_, edited by myself and Jean Byrne in the 
Routledge Hindu Studies Series. This collection of essays focuses on 
manifestations of yoga in modern and transnational contexts, and brings 
together for the first time some of the leading scholars working in this 
area, as well as newer voices.

Full contents are listed at the end of this email. More details can be 
found at:
