buried images
When travelling in Kathiawar in the early 90s with Peter Schreiner, we 
encountered local living traditions in the Dhank/Junagadh region of 
underground murtis.  These were thought to be relics from an earlier 
and better time, before a sage cursed the former town to sink underground. 
The villagers routinely discovered murtis when building the foundations of 
new houses, and this was their explanation.
I would expect Tod to have records of this in his Travels in Western 
India.  I've found several of the legends he collected are still 
current in village communities today.
