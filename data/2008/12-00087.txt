Obituary-Pandit Nilkanth Gurtoo (A Sanskrit Pandit from              Kashmir)
Allen,
              I am yet to find that out. I will  have to talk to his  
family members and sort out the things. Thanks for asking anyway. In  
case I find some useful unpublished material, I shall try to put the  
scanned versions online. Best. MK
