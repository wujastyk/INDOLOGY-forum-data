Medical History
Dear Colleagues,
Could someone recommend an Asian/South Asian/Indian medical history  
that would cover the period from approximately the fifth century AD   
to 15th century AD? Specifically, I am trying to find indian  
references to the 6th c. pandemic known in the Byzantine world as the  
Plague of Justinian.
Your help is much appreciated!
With Thanks,
Mary
