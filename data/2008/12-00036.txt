Subject: Tantra questions: bija mantras and Woodroffe's reputation              today

I would suggest the writings of Andr? Padoux, esp. 
Vac: The Concept of the Word, though his short,
elegant summary in French, L'energie de la parole,
is in many respects more accessible.
A good place to begin might also be 
the late Harvey Alper's anthology, Understanding Mantra.
