Clarification about Spoken Sanskrit
Dear Sanskrit Lovers,
It is so strange that Sanskrit is called a dead language by its own student 
!! It is not at all a dead language as it has been declared as 'mother 
tongue' by some people though they are very few. Further, other than its 
liturgical usage literature of big and small sizes is still produced in that 
language in the Bharatadesa . There are many Sanskrit journals, periodicals 
and daily newspapers such as SUDHARMAA, AMRITABHAASHAA,etc. which are even 
now read by many Sanskrit lovers in India.
A person living in far away europe or America may not be able to understand 
the situation and much less appreciate.
Comparison with Latin does not hold good at all as production of literary 
works in Latin is practically nil now.
As very strickingly put forth by Jan Houben, "In 1,000
years time, Sanskrit will still be the same, but every other language will 
have changed beyond recognition." Sanskrit is chiranaviinaa-ever new and 
youthful !
