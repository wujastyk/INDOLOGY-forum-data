The effects of different Sanskrit poetic meters
Dear Jenny Cover,
I have dealt with this topic in two of my publications. Unfortunately
they are in German. Kindly consult my home page:
http://www.staff.uni-marburg.de/~hahnm/
Then go to "Publications", Monographs No. 8 (1983) and Paper No. 30
(1982). At the end of the paper you will find more bibliographical hints
that might be useful for you.
