Subject: Online catalogs of major Indian University libraries
Message-ID: <161227084007.23782.241340981989370920.generated@prod2.harmonylists.io>

Just thought of sharing that major academic libraries of indian 
universities are now being digitized and their catalogs are available
online:

I had heard the dismal state of Indian libraries many times and just
thought of finding out if the situation is improving at all, the above
resource seems to be a step in the right direction. More on this at:
