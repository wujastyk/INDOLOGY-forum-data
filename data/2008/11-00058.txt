Thanks. I have a question, however. Is a virama/halanta sign written after
the "r" of "Koduvayur" when the name is written in Malayalam? I gave a
transcription of how the name appeared in Devanagari in the.Rtam issue
published in honour of K.A.S.I, not a phonetic/phonemic rendering. This is
the practice the LC (rightly) follows (at least in most cases).
