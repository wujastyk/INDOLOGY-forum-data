Request for help with manuscript
Swapping round the tops and bottoms of photos 3 and 4 might help.  The  
top of 3 certainly looks as if it would fit better with the bottom of  
4.  The label on the top part of 3 might then also fit better, for it  
seems to read magaramuraari.h||, perhaps an error for makaramuraari.h ?
Yours, with best wishes,
Dominic Goodall
