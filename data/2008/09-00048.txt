Request for help with Telugu
I wonder if anybody who knows Telugu can help with this. I have a gloss in 
Pali on the place name Mora.n.da, the supposed place of origin of 
Buddhaghosa: "nemaliiti telagu-vohaaro ca morassa, gundalu iti ca a.n.dassa"
I have ascertained that "nemali" is indeed "peacok" (mora), but I can't find 
any confirmation that "gundulu" is "egg" (or similar) in Telugu.
I would be grateful for any help with this.
Best wishes,
Stephen Hodge
