Dear Dominik,
do you know if there is already, or somebody does plan, to constitute 
a (evolutive) web-site repertoire of all the downloadable Indological 
works (text-editions, studies in the form of books or articles, 
scanned by/for Google or by other) in a classified form, a bit like, 
and complementary to, GRETIL for the electronic texts.
With all my best wishes,
Christophe
