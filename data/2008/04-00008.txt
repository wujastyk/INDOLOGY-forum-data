subhasita [--> nyaaya] of Samkara
Ashok is right in referring to Kumarila, but a small correction is in order: the reference should be to TV on 3.1.7.14 (volume 97, part IV [1972], p. 90  of the Anandasrama edition); the editors have also given an explanation in a note.  The nyaaya is also explained in the Nyaayasuddhaa ad loc. (p. 1033).  Regards, George Cardona
