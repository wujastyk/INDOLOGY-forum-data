??????????? From the earliest part of the Rgveda the root nad means 'to make noise, murmur etc'. Intra-Vedic developments like nand 'to rejoice' and nan?ndr? 'husband's sister'. indicate the noise to be agreeable. In RV 10.11.2 nad?sya n?d? p?ri p?tu me m?nas means most probably 'let (the nymph) protect us in the sound of the resounding (song).'? Perhaps, and against the common idea, roaring noise might not have been meant by the root. The meaning of 'river' in nada came into being by way of polysemy. This connection had been guessed by or known through elite tradition to the poet of the Atharvaveda(3.13/3.4) who etymologically relates nad? 'river' to the verb nad. All these were developments within there being no question of any original Indian Austric or Tamil connection. 
??????????? But the verb is inherited. The word nad?nto in Gathic Av.(33.4c) is taken to mean 'one scorning ' but it may imply muttering. Then this also could be polysemous the common element being low noise.
??????????? Borrowing from Austric or Austronesian, then, could take place only in Central Asia if that had been a common habitat of the early Aryans. Till now no definite positive evidence for such borrowing could be furnished. Rgvedic words like l?ngala and j?m?ta have Austronesian linguistic connection but Central Asia is not in picture with these.
??????????? The theory of Indian Austric connexion of nada/nad? does not stand.
