The Kadamba tree is identified by Monier-Williams (p. 247)
as Nauclea Cadamba and by Apte (p. 527) as Stephegyne
Parviflora Korth. The comment in Apte's entry that it
"is said to put forth buds at the roaring of thunder-
clouds" precisely fits the context in the passage that
concerns me (Prabodhacandrodaya, 4.13c).

Does anyone have a clue about the correct botanical
identification, and whether there is a familiar 
English name in use?

thanks in advance,
Matthew
