Early Inscribed Hero Stones in Tamil Nadu
Hello,
I agree with Herman Tieken.
True. A present evidence to testify:Today, if you travel from north to  
south through NH 47 of India you can see in the boards on the roadside  
the name of the place Kanyakumari written as Knyakrmari in Devanagari.  
The person who wrote it is a painter who is not capable of taking into  
account such mistakes.
