Mahabhasya now available in Intratext version
I've just had a look at the intratext page again, and it's gobbledegook to 
me as well, whatever settings I use.  Something must have changed at their 
end, after everything being okay at the beginning.  Hand on heart, it was 
all fine when it first came live.
I'll talk to them.
Best,
Dominik
