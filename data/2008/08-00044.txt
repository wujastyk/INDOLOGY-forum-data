?I am afraid I reacted with undue haste without going through the whole of Kapstein's letter.?
The difficulty is that I have not?the documents with me. What appeared to me striking is that the very word taddhita could have been meant. It has been meant, I think. But I could have been absolutely certain if I had consulted the material concerned. 
In?case this suggestion of mine is correct the translation bdag gi don la de dang mthun pa'i rkyen brjod par bya ba'i phyir ro? should have been based on an original that stood as svaarthe taddhitapratyayasya vihitatvaat that can be roughly translated into English as? ?since a taddhta suffix has been enjoined in the meaning of the stem?. But as I said this is a provisional translation.
But it seems very likely that the commentator's skill lies in his ability to make a rendering that makes the meaning of the word taddhita explicit though, as Kapsein argues, it is not the usual translation. That I am unable to comment on at present.

Thank you very much to Dipak Bhattacharya and Matthew Kapstein for their replies
to my continued inquiry. I believe that Professor Kapstein's suggestion
"tatsama" works well in the passage, provided of course that it can be
understood in a more literal meaning that is different from its later technical
use of denoting Sanskrit loanwords in New Indo-Aryan languages, as also noted by
Kapstein. I think that would be an acceptable supposition for its occurrence in
two 6th-7th century texts. Thank you very much for the kind help.
 
Sincerely, 
Tim
