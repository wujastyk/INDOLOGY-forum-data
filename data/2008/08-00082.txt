Question
Dear members of the list,
In his grammar/introduction to Sanskrit (exercise V, sentence 2, p. 99), Jan
Gonda gives the following sentence:
striyo nisargAdeva paNDitAH
Would any of you happen know where this statement comes from? An exact
"chapter and verse" would be very helpful!
Best regards
Lars Martin Fosse
