Dear Colleagues,

The first release candidate for the new HTML version of Monier-Williams
Sanskrit-English Dictionary is now available:

 Indica et Buddhica - Repositorium
 http://repositorium.indica-et-buddhica.org/

This represents a complete rewrite based on the most recent version of
the Cologne source file (`MONIER2008' -- download from here:
http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/download.html). All users of
previous versions are encouraged to upgrade.

The dictionary marked up in HTML (`XHTML 1.0 Strict') can be found in
the zip archive `mw_html_rc1.zip'. Installation instructions can be
found in the `README.TXT' file.

As usual, comments and corrections are most welcome. They should be
mailed to me or entered in this form, whatever is convenient:

 http://indica-et-buddhica.org/sections/about-ieb/contact-form 

A final release will be made once I have had a chance to incorporate
suggestions.


Best regards,

 Richard Mahoney


P.S. I would like to express my deep gratitude to Dr Thomas Malten for
kindly permitting a new release of the HTML version based on the most
recent version of the Cologne source.
