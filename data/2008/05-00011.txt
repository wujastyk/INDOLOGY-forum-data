Here on a Mac with Firefox 2.0.0.14, I have the same effect. While the 
character encoding is specified as UTF-8 in the header of the page, the 
page text itself shows garbled HTMl entities. The same also happens on a 
Windows XP machine with Internet Explorer 7.0. Actually, in the browser 
it looks exactly like what happens when I type UTF-8 in an editor and 
then save the file as ASCII ...
