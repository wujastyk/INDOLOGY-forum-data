Scan needed ~ Udanavarga pages
Dear Stephen
Manchester University Library apparently still has the book, though 
since re-organization it seems to have been placed in store, 
entailing a bit of notice to get hold of it. If you are still stuck 
tomorrow,  let me know and I will try to pick it up when I go in to 
teach Sanskrit on Friday.
Best wishes--
Valerie
