Dear Robert,

At last something eminently sensible in the debate about living/dead,  
modern spoken/written Sanskrit. Thank you!

Regarding the Census figures I posted a while ago, I was very well  
aware of the fraudulent nature of these figures. As Robert has  
pointed out, nobody will check the claims about mother tongue. Take  
for example the number of Assamese speakers: many Bengali-speakers in  
Assam find it safer for political reasons to declare Assamese as  
their mother tongue instead of Bengali. The high figure for Sanskrit  
speakers  in the 1991 Census can easily be explained by the Hindu  
revivalism taking place in the late 80s with the televised Ramayana  
etc. which ultimately led to the destruction of the Babri Masjid in  
1992. The "missing"  35,601 speakers in the 2001 Census is harder to  
explain, but rather telling after several years of a BJP government  
at the Centre. Was it disenchantment with Hindutva educational  
policies? At any rate the so-called Sanskrit speakers make an  
entirely political statement. Quod erat demonstrandum!
