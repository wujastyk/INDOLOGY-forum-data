digital Sanskrit Buddhist canon:Madhyamakavatara
One can hardly overestimate the utility of the "digital Sanskrit Buddhist canon" but?its choice of edition may leave a bit to be desired. For the Asokavadaana it depends on the popular Saahitya Akademi edition instead of?Cowell-Neil's. There are some?emendations in the former that seem unnecessary. I have not checked any other work. DB

As in other cases, the Digital Sanskrit Buddhist Canon seems to rely on the
CIHTS edition:
Candrak?rti:  _Madhyamak?vat?ra of ?carya Candrak??rti : root text along
with the autocommentary, chapters 1-5_ / by Candrakirti; restored into Sanskrit,
tr. into Hindi and crit. ed. Tibetan text by Tashi Tsering. - Sarnath : Central
Institute for Higher Tibetan Studies, 2005. - xii, 522 p. - (Bibliotheca
Indo-Tibetica series ; 58)
ISBN 81-8712735-X
All the best
