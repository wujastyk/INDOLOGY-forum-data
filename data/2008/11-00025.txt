Matsunami Seiren, Saundarananda edition
Birgit,
Alas, the Library of Congress does not own the pertinent vol. of Taisho?
Daigaku kenkyu? kiyo? : Bukkyo? Gakubu, Bungakubu, but there are more
than a dozen libraries, including 2 in Germany and 2 in the UK, that
report the title (in two separate records) in WorldCat (OCLC numbers
183227891 and 8426969).  Perhaps you can search the catalogs of the
libraries listed and find if any own this particular vol.
