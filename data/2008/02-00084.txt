yuupa-inscriptions
Is anyone aware of further literature about, or discoveries of new  
inscribed Yuupas, besides those assembled in B. Ch. Chhabra, "Yuupa  
Inscriptions", in India Antiqua (Fel. Vol. J. Ph. Vogel, Leiden 1947)?
Does anyone have access to or know about good illustrations? (I have  
found the AIIS photo of the Badva Yuupa that is available online.)
Thank you,
