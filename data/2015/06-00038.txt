[INDOLOGY] Article about the politics surrounding	indology	at	the IHRC
Thank you for this helpful article. Kindly note:
1. As Geoffrey noted in the other article, here too Bharadwaj does not appear to make any clearly racist remark.
2. Ironically, it seems he wants to remove race from the historical analysis, unless I misunderstood the following:
?...the professor also says that the Dravidian identity was also conjured up as a counter to the Aryan construct.
That the Aryan-Dravidian conflict is a myth has been validated by recent genetic studies as well.?
3. I certainly do not endorse Bharadwaj?s views, but respected scholars like Edwin Bryant (In Quest of the Origins of Vedic Culture) show that the issue is, at the very least, a bit more complex than one might presume from some accounts.
4. That the non-specialist authors of both articles seem to bash Bharadwaj in itself reveals an interesting slice of contemporary cultural history.
Thanks again,
Howard
