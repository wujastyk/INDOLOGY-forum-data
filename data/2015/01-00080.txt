Subject: [INDOLOGY] Metrically restored Rgveda and traditional recitation

It is the metrically restored text which the ?k-Pr?ti??khya enjoins for
recitation. I have heard the disyllabic recitation from at least two Vedic
reciters and was myself advised to do so with the few verses that I had to
learn to utter as a child. But I have not examined each and every case of
recitation.  I hope Professor Deshpande has the same experience

Best
