Dear Fran?ois,
According to H.D. Velankar's *Jayad?man* (Bombay 1949), pp. 41?43, and his
later article on Trivikrama in JASB 33 (1958) 25?68, the dates are as
follows:
   - Trivikrama: latter half of the 11th c. CE (he was a student of
   Vardham?na, the preceptor of King Kar?a of Ahnilvad Patan, r. 1064?1094)
   - Sulha?a: sa?. 1246/1190 CE (he refers to the Param?ra king
   Vindhyavarman in his examples)
   - Somacandra: sa?. 1329/1271 CE
   - R?macandra: beginning of the 16th c. CE.
