[INDOLOGY] Fun media piece about the Mitanni: Sanskrit in	Ancient Syria
Dear George
I apologize for my slow response.  I've been dealing with my wife's health
issues [worrisome but not life-threatening].
As far as I can tell ?di is not attested in Vedic.  As for Skt. in general,
I don't have the resources to check right now.   As for horses, they are of
course common in Vedic, but riding horses is relatively rare, at least in
the RV, and when they are yoked, it is often hard to tell whether they are
yoked to chariots or to wagons.
Also, I recently got an email from a stranger who has informed me that the
Mitanni text has some loanwords from Middle Indo-Aryan!
This is why I am not interested in these OIT debates.
George
