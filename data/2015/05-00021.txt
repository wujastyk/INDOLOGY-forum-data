=?utf-8?Q?Re:_[INDOLOGY]=09New_Book:_The_=C4=80tman-Brahman_in_Ancient_Buddhism?=
Dear Joseph,
Sorry I did not specify that the statement I quoted from Prof.
Bhattacharya's Preface is translated from his 1973 French Preface. He did
not write a new preface for the English edition. Yes, I think Buddhist
scholars, for the most part, took his French book fairly well. At least,
that is what I deduce from the four reviews of it that I read. On the other
hand, from a statement that he made in an article published two years
later, he apparently did get a fair amount of negative reflex-type
responses to it. He wrote in 1975 (p. 3):
"It is sometimes said that although the texts that have been used prove
that the Buddha did not deny the Upani?adic *?tman*, or even that he
accepted it, there are others, thousands of others, which prove just the
opposite. Well, since the names of those texts have not been revealed so
far, I will stick to my position until it is *proved* wrong."
He continued to write on this topic throughout his life, in at least ten
articles from 1975 to 2006. I have gathered these articles and posted scans
of them, along with the brief biography and full bibliography published in
1999 in ?Guruvandana: Essays in Indology in Honour of K. Bhattacharya,?

I have also scanned and posted the original 1973 French book here:

Thanks for asking about a Kindle version. This will spur me on to get one
set up. Hopefully this will not take very long.
