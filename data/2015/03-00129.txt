> *RATIONALE*
>
>              For more than three decades, the Indian diaspora has been
> the subject of many discussions and studies among researchers interested
> in the historical and economic aspects as well as the anthropological,
> social and political dimensions of migration. However, the presence of
> Indian languages and their role ??within these diaspora populations have
> so far attracted very limited interest than expected. Of all the
> elements of identity (re)construction, language retention and
> transmission is the most problematic. Retention and transmission of the
> diasporic Indian languages may be mapped along a continuum ranging from
> disappearance or extreme marginalization to recovery, preservation and
> promotion through socio-cultural organizations or, in the ideal
> situation, by the State.
>
>              The conference focuses on the languages of origin (*LO*) of
> the Indian diaspora societies, immigrated during the /historical period
> of indenture/ that is from 1834 to 1920, known as the historical or old
> diaspora. They are settled in the following countries and areas:
> Malaysia, Singapore, Myanmar, Mauritius, Reunion, Seychelles, South
> Africa, Fiji, Guyana, Suriname, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Trinidad and
> Tobago. They belong to the two main linguistic groups of the
> sub-continent: The *Indo-Aryan group*: Hindi (Awadhi & Bhojpuri), Urdu,
> Marathi, Gujarati, Sindhi, Punjabi and Konkani; and the*Dravidian
> group*: Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam.
>
> *            The objective of the Conference is to provide a forum for
> discussion and interaction among researchers and educators on
> theoretical language retention and transmission issues in diasporic
> contexts, enhanced by relevant country-based case studies.*
>
>              The conference, being hosted in Guadeloupe, will pay
> particular attention to the Indian diaspora people settled in the French
> overseas departments (DOM): La R?union, Guadeloupe and Martinique. It is
> important to highlight that most of them are of South Indian origin and
> claim Tamil as their language and culture.
>
>              The focus of the present Conference lies on two related
> aspects of the Indian language ??diasporic situation as part of the
> process of identity construction:
> 1. Strategies of language retention
> 2. Modes of language transmission
>
