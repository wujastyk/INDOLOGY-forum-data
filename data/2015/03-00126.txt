*RATIONALE*

             For more than three decades, the Indian diaspora has been 
the subject of many discussions and studies among researchers interested 
in the historical and economic aspects as well as the anthropological, 
social and political dimensions of migration. However, the presence of 
Indian languages and their role ??within these diaspora populations have 
so far attracted very limited interest than expected. Of all the 
elements of identity (re)construction, language retention and 
transmission is the most problematic. Retention and transmission of the 
diasporic Indian languages may be mapped along a continuum ranging from 
disappearance or extreme marginalization to recovery, preservation and 
promotion through socio-cultural organizations or, in the ideal 
situation, by the State.

             The conference focuses on the languages of origin (*LO*) of 
the Indian diaspora societies, immigrated during the /historical period 
of indenture/ that is from 1834 to 1920, known as the historical or old 
diaspora. They are settled in the following countries and areas: 
Malaysia, Singapore, Myanmar, Mauritius, Reunion, Seychelles, South 
Africa, Fiji, Guyana, Suriname, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Trinidad and 
Tobago. They belong to the two main linguistic groups of the 
sub-continent: The *Indo-Aryan group*: Hindi (Awadhi & Bhojpuri), Urdu, 
Marathi, Gujarati, Sindhi, Punjabi and Konkani; and the*Dravidian 
group*: Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam.

*            The objective of the Conference is to provide a forum for 
discussion and interaction among researchers and educators on 
theoretical language retention and transmission issues in diasporic 
contexts, enhanced by relevant country-based case studies.*

             The conference, being hosted in Guadeloupe, will pay 
particular attention to the Indian diaspora people settled in the French 
overseas departments (DOM): La R?union, Guadeloupe and Martinique. It is 
important to highlight that most of them are of South Indian origin and 
claim Tamil as their language and culture.

             The focus of the present Conference lies on two related 
aspects of the Indian language ??diasporic situation as part of the 
process of identity construction:
1. Strategies of language retention
2. Modes of language transmission

*

WORKING THEMES OF THE CONFERENCE

2.1) Transmission through institutional, socio-cultural associations, 
family and group networks

2.3) Ethno-linguistic groups and linguistic claims
2.4) LO vitality and trans-generational transmission (corpus analysis of 
ancestral literatures, ritual songs etc.)
2.5) Language and teacher training: content and methodology
2.6) Developing / adapting teaching methods and appropriate pedagogical 
materials
2.7) The role / contribution of new technologies
