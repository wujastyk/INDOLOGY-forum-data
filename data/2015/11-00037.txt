The authors participating in the series of dialectics of Nyayamrita-Advaitasiddhi are not only well-versed in many disciplines like Nyaya, Vyakarana, Meemamsa and Vedanta, but employed them in the dialectic works authored by them.

Stalwarts like Adi Shankara, Udayana, Jayanta Bhatta, Madhva, Jagannatha Pandita were not just limited to their domain.
