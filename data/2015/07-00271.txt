[INDOLOGY] Does anyone know of Sanskrit works that use 2nd-syllable rhyming?
Second-syllable rhyme is also a sine qua non in Kannada poetry, and
Jayak?rti uses it in his definitions/examples (all in Sanskrit) of
different verse-forms in the Chandonu??sana (ca. 1000 CE)---not just in the
seventh chapter, where J. exemplifies some Kannada meters, but also
occasionally in the sixth, which treats of Prakrit and Apabhra??a meters.
According to Yigal Bronner and David Shulman ("A Cloud Turned Goose" in
IESHR 43 in 2006), it's also used in later Sanskrit works by Tamil authors
(??kalya Malla's *Ud?rar?ghava* and N?laka??ha D?k?ita's *?ival?l?r?ava*).
