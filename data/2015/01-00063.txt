[INDOLOGY] N. Ganesan's Dravidian etymologies for 'makara', etc.
I checked the Indology archives. The attachments have come through well. Since the problem may be in your computer, please try this alternative method of downloading the attachments from these links.

My good wishes to all for a very happy and productive New Year 2015!
Note: My own computer has been sent in for repair and I'm using an old, unstable, borrowed machine. So, the following is a quick response. I hope to send in my comments once I have a robust computer. The one I'm using now may crash anytime while I'm typing in. 
Two attachments from the original mail on this topic didn't download properly. They just come out as a blank file.

WOW and Bravo, that's all I can say for now about the original article by Dr. Ganesan and the critique from Dr. Palaniappan. 
I am deeply eager to hear responses from our esteemed colleagues, especially from Professors Asko Parpola, M. Witzel, Madhav Deshpande, George Hart, ..., and a savvy engineer Suresh G. (student of Bh. Krishnamurti), and many other scholars such as Jean Luc Chevillard on this list.
I'll share my thoughts when I have a robust computer since I need proper diacritics and a non-failing email client all to type.
Thanks and regards,
V.S. Rajam
