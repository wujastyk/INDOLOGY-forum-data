Subject: [INDOLOGY] Developing story on alleged plagiarism by Rajiv Malhotra
Message-ID: <CAKq175onwBWTJ23oVaT9f2HKbs1kSqub0o=c+xRPh__4B8bJjA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Colleagues,

List members may be interested in the growing story of alleged plagiarism
of several scholars, including a list member, by Rajiv Malhotra. The story
has been largely developing on twitter (#message4rajiv). Also see the nice
summary on reddit:
