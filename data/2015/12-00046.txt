[INDOLOGY] Rgveda Padapaatha DVD from Kerala
Dear Harry,
The padap??has are included in these two recensions of the ?gveda that have
only recently become available in printed editions:
??val?yana-Sa?hit? of the ?gveda, edited by B. B. Chaubey, 2 volumes., New
Delhi: Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts, 2009.
The ?gveda Sa?hit? of ???kh?yana-??kh?, edited by Amal Dhari Singh Gautam,
4 volumes., Ujjain: Maharshi Sandipani Rashtriya Veda Vidya Pratishthan,
2012-2013.
When the description of the new DVD referred to "four versions of Pada
Paatha texts available at the time of its preparation," it added: "It has
been observed that these texts have large number of errors ? both printing
as well as substantial."
So my question also pertains to whether these errors are in the various
long available printed editions of the ?gveda in the ??kala ??kh? that
include the padap??ha, or whether these errors are in the more recent
printed editions of the ?gveda in the ??val?yana ??kh? and in the ???kh?yana
??kh? that include the padap??ha.
Best regards,
