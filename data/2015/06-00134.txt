It is perhaps worth pointing out that in the poetic style of English 
that Griffith was using "with pointed horn" is strictly speaking also 
neutral as to number. Compare this phrase from George Henry Needler's 
1904 translation of the Nibelungenleid (916): " The boar within the 
forest they?d chase with pointed spear"
