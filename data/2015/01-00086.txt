[INDOLOGY] Metrically restored Rgveda and traditional recitation
Is there a misunderstanding? There is no doubt that metrical defects that
are incorrigible do exist. I came across cases of nine syllable
g?yatr?s/anu??ubhs that have not been classified by the Pr?ti??khyas.
Whitney too noted some of them. These are defective metres and are meant
when it is asserted that one syllable too many or less does not matter.
But is not *??yo n??tanair ut?* to be read as *?liyo n??tanair ut? *covered
by ?k-Pr?ti??khya 17.14(22-23) and 8.22(40)? Again, that one is still asked
to recite *v?re?iya? *in RV 3.62.10a also points to the old tradition of
reading disyllabic for metrical consistency. Obviously the RP means such
cases as can be made regular by disyllabic reading. The tradition became
weak and slack through the ages.
