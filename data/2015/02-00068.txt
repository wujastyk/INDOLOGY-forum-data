I?m hoping that a list member can share a Sanskrit text of ma?iprabh? of r?m?nandasarasvat?, a commentary on the yogas?tra. The DLI copy, which repeatedly failed to download with DLI Downloader turns out to be a defective scan. I tried to download it page by page and found that none of the scanned pages is complete.
