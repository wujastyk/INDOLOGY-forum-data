If I correctly understood the question it would be an uphill task that has
to be separately taken up and then to be decided. For, the old Catalogus
Catalogorum is outdated and the compilation of a new one was still going on
when I last visited it. The task of finding out just reported manuscripts
gave progressively different results.
But I might have wrongly understood the question mentioned.
