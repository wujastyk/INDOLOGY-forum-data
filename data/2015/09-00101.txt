Dear Members,
I am looking for a pdf of Aurel Stein'sCatalogue of the Sanskrit manuscripts in the Raghunath temple library of His Highness the Maharaja of Jammu & Kashmir.
I have consulted such catalogue in Jammu, but was unable to take pictures. I am also aware of a Descriptive catalogue compiled in recent times by M.M. Patkar, D. Shastri, K.K. Mishra and published by the same institution. Is anyone able to help?Best,
Alessandro BattistiniPhD CandidateSapienza Universit? di Roma_______________________________________________
