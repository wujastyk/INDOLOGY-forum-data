[INDOLOGY] Vedic verse in Ortega y Gasset
Dear Michael,
Of course, you are right [as are Jamison and Brereton] that dhimasi in the
gayatri mantra is derived from the root dhaa-, but the following word in
this mantra is "dhiyoh."
This suggests to me that the author of RV 3.62.10 was engaged in some kind
of word-play, or a wrong etymology.  In any case, it has been a memorable
move.
