[INDOLOGY] access to SouthAsiaArchive?
Dear colleagues,
Does any of you have access to the "SouthAsiaArchive"? If so, I'd appreciate your downloading and sending me this item:
<http://www.southasiaarchive.com/Content/sarf.120027/205631/003>
It appears they have the whole Indian Historical Quarterly available, which is very nice; it would be even nicer if it were freely available to all.
Thanks and best wishes,
Arlo Griffiths
