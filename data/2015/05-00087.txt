Dear Arlo, Peter and McComas,

Many thanks for all of this.  I am aware of (and indeed have read) the 
second part in /Anamorphoses,/ so I have been waiting ever since to 
discover where part 1 would in fact be published.  I do not know 
Indonesian at all and was misled by the article title as given in my 
source into thinking that this part would also be in English.  I would 
therefore be very grateful for access to the English draft and thank 
Peter very much for his offer to send a copy of that.

With all good wishes

John
