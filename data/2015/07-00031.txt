[INDOLOGY]  Vayu-Purana Critical Edition Status?
Thank you, McComas, for your very informative and at the same time fun to
read quick report on the World Sanskrit Conference, Bangkok 2015. You
mentioned co-convening the first ever independent panel on the pur??as. I
wonder if you or anyone here knows the status of the forthcoming critical
edition of the *V?yu-pur??a* from the Oriental Institute, Vadodara. Since
this is generally regarded as the oldest pur??a we have, its critical
edition is especially important. I anxiously await its publication.
Best regards,
