[INDOLOGY] Das Ch. "The Sacred and Ornamental Characters of Tibet"
Dear members of the list,
I was looking for the following article in the JASB (1888), but on 
archive.org I found only the second volume of this year:
Das, Ch.: The Sacred and Ornamental Characters of Tibet. In: Journal of 
the Asiatic
Society of Bengal. Calcutta, Vol. 57, Nr. 1, 1888, S. 41-48.
Could please help me with it? Does any of you have access to a digital 
copy of the first 1888 volume?
Thanks a lot,
Camillo Formigatti
