[INDOLOGY] Nyaya discussions on faulty examples
If I remember correctly, this is not the Nyaya definition which says  
that an "example" is what is accepted by the learned and unlearned. Of  
course it is questionable whether dRSTAnta in the NS means example or  
only "an obvious state of affairs." The definition you refer to would  
appear for instance in the NyAyapraveza.
Best wishes,
Eli
