[INDOLOGY] as long as the moon and the sun shall shine
Dear List members,
In the S??c? version of A?oka's Schism Edict we come across the expression (putapapotike) ca?das?riyike, ?(as long as my sons and great-grandsons shall reign and) the moon and the sun (shall shine)?. A variant is found in the so-called Seventh Pillar Edict: putapapotike ca?damasuliyike hotu ti.
I am certain I have come across the expression before, but at the moment can think only of cantir?titta-varai in a South Indian Tamil inscription. Furthermore, I remember having once seen a photograph of a hero-stone (or was it a sat?-stone) with a sun and a moon carved in the upper part.
I hope someone on the list can help me with some more information. What I would in particular like to know is how wide-spread this expression is, what are the oldest instances, and if it has been described in the secondary literature.
With kind regards, Herman
