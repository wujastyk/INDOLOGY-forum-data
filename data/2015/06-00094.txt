[INDOLOGY] The so-called German Indology
I only read about half the book, so I am not well qualified to respond. My impression was that the book started as a project on the Bhagavadgita, which was a bit expanded to include the history of research on the Mahabharata. The whole thing was then packaged as a history of German Indology, but obviously the book does not deliver what its subtitle promises. The authors are blissfully ignorant of German Indology, and they probably know it. They claim to provide a history of German Indology by sketching a history of its method. But Indology, the German included, does not have a method (in the sense that it does not have a single method, as the authors imagine). 
I was told that one of the authors, I can't remember which, was failed PhD student of Michael Hahn, which explains perhaps the nasty tone of expression throughout the book.
Best wishes,
Eli
