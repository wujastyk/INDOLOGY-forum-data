cohorts, and share one's current research with the field. From senior  
scholars to graduate students, ACSAA symposia are one of the primary  
ways ACSAA members gather and support one another, share ideas with a  
group of like-minded colleagues, and participate in the ACSAA community.

For ACSAA XVII, we invite proposals for individual papers and  
pre-formed panels (4 papers of 20 min each, or experimental panel  
formats, such as PechaKucha style presentations, not to exceed 60 min)  
that reflect original and/or new research in South and Southeast Asian  
art history. 2015 marks ACSAA?s 50th anniversary and thus proposals  
that reflect on the historiography of the discipline are encouraged.  
Abstracts should reference ties to existing bodies of literature.  
Preference will be given to proposals from individuals who did NOT  
present full-length papers at ACSAA XVI in order to give more members  
the opportunity to present. However, all members are welcome to  
propose experimental panel formats and/or ideas for round-table  
discussions. All presenters and panel chairs must be ACSAA members in  
good standing.

Individual papers: Please submit a 250-word abstract & 1-page CV.
Panel Proposals: Please submit 250-word abstracts for panel concept  
and each paper, along with 1-page CV
for panel chair and each presenter.

Submit all materials and inquiries to: acsaa2015 at gmail.com
