Subject: [INDOLOGY] Mss. from Rotkuppelraum, Qyzyl
Message-ID: <5616D620.7030004@u.washington.edu>

Does anyone happen to know of a detailed description of the 
circumstances of discovery of Sanskrit and Tocharian manuscripts in the 
"Rotkuppelraum" at Qyzyl by A. von le Coq? (This is only very cursorily 
described in his "Buried Treasures of Chinese Turkestan", p.126 of the 
English version.)

Also, is there a convenient comprehensive list of the manuscripts that 
came from this cave?

Thanks
Rich Salomon
