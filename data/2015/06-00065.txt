[INDOLOGY] Article about the politics surrounding Indology	at	the IHRC
Dear everyone,
I would suggest that all be more restrained in the use of the term "racist," the connotations of which
generally suggest that the person so characterized attributes constitutional inferiority, or ritual pollution,
or moral degradation, or animality, etc., to certain classes of persons on account of their "race," a term
whose precise significance is deeply problematic. Chauvanism is not the same thing, nor is triumphalism, though
these also involve judgments of human inequality.
The Aryan topos frequently is imbricated with racism, but it is not necessarily so. More damning, in my view,
have been the reckless, unscientific confusions of historical linguistics, cultural history, mythology,
genetics, archeology, nationalism, etc., that characterize many of the recent discussions. These are not by any
means to be mixed indiscriminately.
Best in my view to be cautious in one's methodology and prudent in one's vocabulary.
