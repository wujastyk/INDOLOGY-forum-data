[INDOLOGY] Indic Script identification: Another MS with similar script
Dear Colleagues,
If I may please interject my own question into this thread, I have a 
similar manuscript whose script I have not been able to identify.
The ms was purchased in Chiang Mai (almost two decades ago), but may 
have come from somewhere else.  One colleague suggested a Burmese script 
(Shan?), but now I am thinking Lanna after seeing the posted sites.
Could anyone please offer a suggestion?  Close-up picture attached.
Thank you!
