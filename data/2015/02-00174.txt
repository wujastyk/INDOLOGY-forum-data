Another idea to throw in the pot is the Library of Congress Name Authority
File (http://authorities.loc.gov).  The LoC people have a huge amount of
experience with this sort of thing, and formal procedures for making
decisions about names, etc.  It's all very professionalized.  E.g., Keshub
Chunder Sen
<http://authorities.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?AuthRecID=7322&v1=1&HC=1&SEQ=20150228092917&PID=-NZqmlNcgEy2OnUmkVy-bOvNN99T>
(the MARC 100 field is the approved heading, the 400s are variants that are
found in various places).
