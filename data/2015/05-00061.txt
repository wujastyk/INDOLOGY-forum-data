Dear Martin,

if I am not wrong, the first stanza is Kum?rila?s ?lokav?rttika 1.17 (with a 
variant reading j??t?rtha? i.o. siddh?rtha?). Some time ago I came across 
a much earlier quotation of the same stanza in the opening part of 
Ratnamati's C?ndravy?kara?apa?jik? (920s?930s). The second stanza is 
?lokav?rttika 1.12. I haven't located it (yet) in the extant parts of Ratna's 
works, but it seems to me highly probable that this Sinhalese scholar has 
quoted it too somewhere. Later scholars in La?k? such as Moggall?na and ?r? 
R?hula borrowed and/or translated into Pali some few stanzas from the 
?lokav?rttika by using Ratna's grammatical works and without knowing that 
they are dealing with stanzas written by Kum?rila.

Kind regards,
D.D.
