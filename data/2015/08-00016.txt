Godabarisha Mishra (ed.) :

Ved?nta Without M?y? ? A debate on Saptavidha-Anupapatti.

??????????? ???????? ? ????????????????????? ????

Published by the Indian Council of Philosophical Research and Motilal
Banarsidass Publishers, Delhi, 2015.



29 papers mostly by Indian contributors, some in English, some in Sanskrit,
divided over four sections,

? Bakground : historical and philosophical ?,

? M?y?-avidy? : the concept and the critique ?,

? Saptavidh?nupapatti : a live debate ?,

? M?y?-avidy? : some reflections ?.

For those able to receive it (it will not remain in the archived version) I
attach a scanned table of content.

Rather than as helpless goats, ?a?kara and R?m?nuja appear here as
intellectual lions, whose domain-defining roars resound even in the live
debate that is central in this volume.
