Godabarisha Mishra (ed.) :
Ved?nta Without M?y? ? A debate on Saptavidha-Anupapatti.
??????????? ???????? ? ????????????????????? ????
Published by the Indian Council of Philosophical Research and Motilal
Banarsidass Publishers, Delhi, 2015.
29 papers mostly by Indian contributors, some in English, some in Sanskrit,
divided over four sections,
? Bakground : historical and philosophical ?,
? M?y?-avidy? : the concept and the critique ?,
? Saptavidh?nupapatti : a live debate ?,
? M?y?-avidy? : some reflections ?.
For those able to receive it (it will not remain in the archived version) I
attach a scanned table of content.
Rather than as helpless goats, ?a?kara and R?m?nuja appear here as
intellectual lions, whose domain-defining roars resound even in the live
debate that is central in this volume.
