Dear Dean,
Since no one has yet replied to this, I will just give some bibliographic
information (not exactly recommendations). I do not know of a systematic
scholarly study of the Buddhist position on an?tman that lays out and
compares the two sides of this question.
The widely accepted view, that the Buddhist an?tman/anatt? teaching denies
the existence of an ?tman/att?, not only in the person but also beyond the
person, is represented in this study:
*Selfless Persons: Imagery and Thought in Therav?da Buddhism*, by Steven
Collins (Cambridge University Press, 1982).
Another study also represents this view, although the author distinguishes
his position on it from that of Collins (p. 7):
*The Selfless Mind: Personality, Consciousness and Nirv??a in Early
Buddhism*, by Peter Harvey (Curzon Press, 1995).
The view that the Buddhist an?tman/anatt? teaching denies the existence of
an ?tman/att? only in the person (pudgala), i.e., in the five aggregates
(skandha) that make up a person, is represented in Kamaleswar
Bhattacharya?s book and in another study:
*Self and Non-Self in Early Buddhism*, by Joaqu?n P?rez-Rem?n (Mouton
Publishers, 1980).
Bhattacharya notes, however (1993, p. 26 fn. 2): ?Despite an apparently
identical standpoint, there is a gulf of difference between P?rez-Rem?n?s
approach and mine?a difference which, unfortunately, has often been missed
by scholars.?
