[INDOLOGY] article by Pargitar in the journal of royal asiatic society of great britain and ireland
I need an article by Pargiter  on imprecations in Sanskrit grants. I do not
know the exact title but it was published in the journal of royal asiatic
society of great britain and ireland (1912) as quoted by J Jolly. (July
1913) in Imprecations in Indian Land Grants
