[INDOLOGY] Friendly Reminder: INDOLOGY posts are best short and	sweet
Dear Colleagues,
This is a friendly reminder that the best way to converse on INDOLOGY is
with messages that are concise and on point. As a rule of thumb, one
screen-full of text is a good benchmark.
On this issue, I invite everybody to review the membership guidelines
<http://indology.info/email/email-const/>, especially paragraph 7.
Many thanks.
Audrey Truschke (INDOLOGY committee member on duty)
