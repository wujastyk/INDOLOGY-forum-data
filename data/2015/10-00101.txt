Subject: [INDOLOGY] Indic Script identification: De Jong Collection	Manuscripts
Message-ID: <373FE003EA3D2949BCC16219C67CBBF77FA72E3A@UCEXMBX04-I.canterbury.ac.nz>

Dear Colleagues,

I'm preparing a small exhibition on the De Jong collection that is now held by the University of Canterbury in New Zealand (http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/collserv/dejong.shtml) as part of initiatives to make this scholarly asset more visible to the research community (and university officials so they are reminded of its worth and importance!)

I found in some of the archival boxes several manuscripts that I would like to put on display, but I'm having trouble identifying the scripts of them.

Two images appear to be from a Palm Leaf manuscript in some sort of South Indian script but I can't put my finger on it exactly.

The other two images appear to be in Tibetan.  Could someone kindly confirm this for me?

(I'm busy getting the librarians to take images of the final folia in case I can make out a colophon...)

Any help greatly appreciated!

With best wishes,
Clemency
