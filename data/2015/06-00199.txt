Further: ? some books have been selected and quoted more or less extensively because they agree with the author. From the textual and argumentative point of view, this practice adds nothing real and could be avoided. It amounts to pro domo propaganda ?. Nothing exposes the bias and hostility behind this fake ?review? more than these comments. To begin with, not one single OIT writer has been quoted by me throughout the entire book: all the quotations without exception are from the scholarly writings of AIT scholars i.e. scholars who would implicitly or explicitly be on the AIT side in any debate (although I have given due credit to two OIT supporting writers, on pp.102 and 338, when I have made certain points; but I have not actually quoted these two writers, both of whom are non-Indian and both hostile to me, and nor are they a part of the bibliography under criticism). If the writings of these AIT scholars ? agree with the author ?, surely it is something for Fournet to ponder over seriously instead of branding it as ? propaganda ?. But these ? agreeable ? quotations are not the only ones quoted by me: I have also quoted and exposed the fallacy of almost as many AIT arguments which do not ? agree with ? me (Witzel, Hock, Lubotsky, etc.). All this is apart from the fact that the overwhelmingly largest number of references in my book are not from any writers, AIT or OIT, but directly from the original sources : the Rigveda and the Avesta ? and it is these original references that polemicists like Fournet and Witzel dread the most and avoid like the plague. 

? 

? 

My preface : The first thing Fournet points out about the preface is the following: ? The Preface (21 p) actually starts on page XVIII and not XV as indicated in the contents ?. Obviously, I cannot answer for this printer?s or publisher?s error. 

? 

He then notes: ? the preface includes a listing of ?errors? and ?mistakes? made in the author?s previous works [?] This could have been preferably located somewhere else, after the bibliography for example ?. So far, this criticism is legitimate: I, in hindsight, would go further and say that this list of errors was really an unnecessary ? interruption ? not only in the preface but in the book itself, and could even have been dispensed with altogether. But Fournet does not stop here; he goes on to make the following pointless and petty comment: ? The meaning of these errata in the preface seems to be that the author has made his own mea culpa and that other people, presumably non OIT supporters, should do the same ?! Freud? Holmes? No, it?s Hercule Fournet! [Fournet tells us a little later on that the book ? can be read in a [sic] several ways: a surface reading of what the writer writes explicitly and deeper readings of what he assumes and thinks but does not write ?. Clearly, this master psychologist cum detective has no place for the explicit data given on the ? surface ? and his whole ?review? is based on these brilliant ? deeper ? pieces of Hercule Fournetian mind-reading, as we will see many times in his review!]. 

? 

About my claim in the preface that my book would prove conclusively that India was the original homeland of the Indo-European family of languages, Fournet makes the following profound observation: ? It can be underlined that the wording is ?homeland of the Indo-European family of languages? and not ?(Proto-)Indo-European homeland? ?! In continuation of this diversionary play on words, Fournet continues: ? The author mentions the word ?Proto-Indo-European? only once, when referring to Hock?s works: ?the Proto-Indo-European language (as much ancestral to Vedic as to the other ancient Indo-European languages)? (p.210). This hapax word is not listed in the index. The author claims to have found the location of something that he about never describes by its name ? (note again the profundity of the last sentence!). Apart from scouring my book to find out which words are missing in my book which he feels should have been there, or in examining the semantic sense in which I have in his opinion misused certain other words, one more aspect of Fournet?s ?review? consists in counting the number of times I have used certain words. But he does not seem to have been very meticulous even in this utterly pointless venture: the phrase ?Proto-Indo-European? is found at least 25 times in my book in this full form, and at least 40 times in the form PIE, and the word ?Indo-European homeland? is found at least 8 times (notably even in the very title of the second section of the book)! 

? 

Fournet?s criticism of my preface also includes a polemical monologue on the phrases AIT and OIT, apparently provoked by my references to the AIT-vs.-OIT debate in my preface. This we will examine separately. 

? 

? 

The textual organization of my book : Fournet tells us at the very beginning of his review: ? The book does not have an explicit conclusion ?. Later, he goes into more details about how ? the textual organization of the book is unusual and defective ?: 

? 

? There is no explicit conclusion, the preface includes errata for previous books and transliteration conventions. The section 1 includes subchapters with titles like Appendix 1 and 2 and Footnote that are in fact incorporated in the body of the text. [?] The book does not begin with a programmatic presentation of what the author plans to state or prove in the section 1. [?] The multiple goals, compounded with the defective textual organization of the book, contribute to the opacity and lack of fluidity of the section ? 

? 

He writes that it is difficult to know ? what the author plans to state or prove in the [sic] section 1 ? since I do not ? begin with a programmatic presentation ? of it, but immediately tells us that his own ? understanding is that he wants to clear several issues at the same time: one is the relative chronology of the books and hymns of the Rig-Veda, another is their absolute chronology, another is the relative chronology of the Rig-Veda and the Avesta, another is to argument [sic] in favor of the supposed westward movements of the Rig-Vedic Indo-Aryans, one more is to expose the perceived fraudulences of the so-called Western scholarship, as exemplified by Witzel ?. Now obviously Fournet does not get all this ? understanding ? from his brilliant detective abilities but from the very title of the section itself, as well as from the titles of the chapters and sub-chapters and headings and sub-headings, quite apart from the fact that the first few paragraphs of every chapter state very clearly what ? the author plans to state or prove ? in that chapter, and the conclusions arising from the data in each chapter and sub-chapter are repeatedly hammered into the readers? attention throughout the concerned chapters and sub-chapters. 

? 

Each chapter is a step-by-step progression from one point to the next: the first two chapters show that the common ?Indo-Iranian? culture originated in the Late Rigvedic period; the third shows us where the Indo-Aryans and proto-Iranians were (i.e. deeper inside India, and not in Central Asia) in the period preceding this period of development of a common culture; and the fourth clarifies how the chronological basis behind all these conclusions is not just the internal chronology of the books postulated by me but the one agreed upon by a consensus of western scholars from Oldenberg through Witzel to Proferes. The fifth chapter analyses the Mitanni Indo-Aryan names and shows how this analysis parallels the analysis of Avestan names in chapter one; and the sixth one shows how this Mitanni data now allows us to arrive at a rough absolute chronology for the Late books of the Rigveda. And, as Fournet himself puts it, ? repetitions and refinements of some key points provide a helpful guideline as to where the author is ultimately going ?. Obviously, no amount of (more) spoon-feeding could have sufficed to prevent these determinedly querulous complaints. 

? 

About my preface, yes, I could have included the transliteration conventions elsewhere, and, as already stated, dispensed altogether with the errata. But, my inclusion of a Footnote as a subchapter in chapter one, and Appendices 1 and 2 as subchapters in chapters 3 and 4, was very logical: those subchapters pertained only to the particular chapters concerned and not to the section as a whole. And yet, they needed to be distinguished from the main point of the chapters concerned: e.g. the main point of chapter 4 was that the internal chronology of the Rigveda, on the basis of which one inevitably arrives at the conclusions reached in the other chapters of section 1, is based on the consensus of western scholars , and that these conclusions simply cannot be rejected without rejecting altogether this consensus of two centuries. The matter in the appendices consisted merely of additional discussions on this internal chronology, so they were distinguished as appendices. The failure of a pedantic critic to understand this logic cannot be construed as a failure or shortcoming on my part. ??????? 

? 

? 

The fonts used by me : ? another feature is the letter fonts, sizes and cases which often vary within any given page. ? This is counted as ? one of the hindrances for the reader to understand what the author wants to say ?. Now, Fournet cannot be referring here to the ? fonts ? used for writing Vedic and Avestan words, since those are absolutely essential. He is therefore obviously referring to my use of italics and bold letters. 

? 

I have used bold letters only in titles and sub-titles and also in two special circumstances: one, in every quotation from other writers, to distinguish what is being quoted from what I myself am writing, and two, in distinguishing the hymn number from the verse number in giving references from the Rigveda. Also, in chapter one, they are statedly used to highlight names common to the Rigveda and the Avesta. I think all these uses of bold letters should in fact be useful in helping the reader to understand better what I want to say. 

? 

Likewise, the different ? sizes ? of the fonts are also used only in titles and sub-titles; and as for ? cases ?, capital letters are likewise used in titles and sub-titles, and in giving references of books, e.g. WITZEL 1995b:35. Italics are also often used for specific purposes: in chapter one, they are used to distinguish the common (to the Rigveda and the Avesta) half of the names from the other parts. Again, all this should be useful to readers, rather than a ? hindrance ?. 

? 

In the case of italics, perhaps I have the habit of using them a bit too much to emphasize words (apart from the fact that the printers have wrongly used italics in subtitles in chapters 2 and 3 where I had indicated bold letters), but that happens to be my style of writing, and I think, like every other writer, I too have the right to my own way of writing. Some of it may be very irritating to many readers; but if any of this actually prevents the reader from understanding what I want to say, it can only be if the reader, like Fournet, has set out determined not to understand what I want to say. 

? 

? 

My maps : About the maps in my book: ? the pages (p.213-258) are dedicated to a detailed description of the scenario proposed by the author, with 6 maps and their related comments. At the first look, we have not been able to understand what the area on the low-quality maps was. The maps are centered on Afghanistan with present-day borders of the different states surrounding Afghanistan ?. 

? 

To begin with, if he is able to immediately tell us that the ? maps are centered on Afghanistan with present-day borders of the different states surrounding Afghanistan ?, what was the need to first claim that he was not able to understand what the area on the maps was? 

? 

He describes the functional maps as ? low-quality ?, and earlier in his review, he jibes that ? a map like the one Talageri?s book displays on p.226 could have been printed in Pictet?s book in 1859 ?. (Complete with the borders of post-1947 India, Pakistan and Afghanistan, and with the inclusion of Anatolian and Tocharian, both identified as Indo-European only in the early twentieth century)? 

? 

The above comments are not only cheap, they are also cowardly: would Fournet have had the guts to say the same thing about, for example, the map depicted on pps.294-295 of H. H. Hock?s article ?Historical Interpretation of the Vedic Texts?, in the Volume ?The Indo-Aryan Controversy: Evidence and inference in Indian history?, Routledge, London and New York (Indian edition), 2005? They are not only as functional (? low-quality ?) as my own maps, they are also much, much less accurate: in the maps, the Indus throughout seems to flow from well within the borders of present-day India before flowing out through Gujarat, to the east and south of the gulf of Kutch, rather than through Pakistan and out through Sind . Further, Fournet complains: ? The borders of the former Soviet republics ( Uzbekistan , Kirghiztan , Kazakhstan ) are missing ? on my map. All borders are missing in Hock?s map, including those of India , Pakistan and Afghanistan . 

? 

? 

My index : ? The Index is divided in two: a General Index and a Sanskrit Word Index. Some words are conspicuously absent from the index: AIT (but not OIT), PIE, proto-language, PreRigVedic (but not PostRigVedic). K.Elst is cited in the index in bold type with no page number. ????? 

? 

Criticisms of structural things, like the preface, bibliography, maps, fonts, index, and the names and arrangements of the chapters and sub-chapters (sections) of a book, must, in general, necessarily be subjective, since in most of these matters the author must be the natural person to decide what is best suited for his purpose in each of these respects. 

? 

Moreover, such criticism is always grossly disproportionate and dishonest (besides being totally inadequate as a substitute for criticizing the actual data and logic presented in the book). About his petty criticism of my index: I can genuinely say my index is the most complete index possible necessary for any analytical study of the material presented in my book , unlike my two earlier books whose indices had not been prepared by me and in which many key words in those books are missing in the index. Of course words like ? AIT (but not OIT), PIE, proto-language, PreRigVedic (but not PostRigVedic) ? are absent from the index, but so are words like Aryan (but not ?rya), Indo-European, Rigveda and Rigvedic, and most of the (Rigvedic and Avestan) personal names in the book except those discussed or mentioned in the book in a distinctive or important context. Words which refer to the central theme of the entire book and are therefore not reference-specific, as well as words not mentioned in my book in any important quotable or referable context, are obviously excluded from my index. Such criticism for the sake of criticism can be made of any book: I challenge Fournet to send me a complete book written by him, and I will produce a long, and much more relevant (than the words cited by him) list of words from his book which are ? conspicuously absent from the index ?. [Incidentally, Elst in the index in bold type with no page number is a printer?s or publisher?s error for which I am not answerable]. 

? 

? 

5. AIT-vs.-OIT : Included in the preface is a polemical monologue on the terms AIT and OIT which contains many profound gems. But first, a look at two instances in this monologue where Fournet tries to show up my ignorance, by citing things of which I am supposed to be ? unaware ?, and only ends up showing his own ignorance: 

? 

One: ?[?] there are several competing theories about the PIE homeland, other than the OIT, which differ both in datation (from the Paleolithic to the early Neolithic to the late Neolithic) and in location (from the North Pole to the Balkans to Southern Russia to Anatolia ). What the author (and presumably the other OIT supporters) calls the AIT is to be understood as one of the mainstream theories: the one which describes a homeland in the Pontico-Caspian area in Southern Russia and a dispersal of the original community around -4000 BC. The bibliography includes two books: from Mallory, who supports this Pontico-Caspian homeland, and from Gamkrelidze and Ivanov, who support Eastern Anatolia as original homeland. Talageri seems to be unaware that his short bibliography includes two works proposing two theories ?. If Fournet had done his homework, he would have seen repeated references in this book, as well as in my second one, to Gamkrelidze?s Anatolian homeland theory as a distinct one from the Pontic-Caspian homeland theory: in this very book, notably on p. 222-23 (where in fact, in a sense, the Anatolian theory is even bracketed together with the OIT rather than with the Pontic-Caspian theory !) and on p.246. This is apart from the different homeland theories referred to in my first book, and the detailed analysis of Tilak?s Arctic theory in my second one.???? 

? 

Two: ? The author seems to be unaware that the OIT has nothing revolutionary at all and that the OIT theory is one of the first theories developed by European scholars in the XIXth century and one of the first to have been dismissed ?. Again, if Fournet had done his homework, he would have known that this fact, that the Indian Homeland theory was one of the earliest theories which was later dismissed, is one of the favourite talking points for those writers from the OIT side who, like Fournet from the AIT side, concentrate only on polemics and rhetoric, and therefore only a particularly na?ve or stupid person would assume that I could be ? unaware ? of it. It is, moreover, referred to by me in my first book which discusses the history of the homeland debate. As for the word ?revolutionary?, it does not simply mean ?new? or ?for the first time?; it means ?something which introduces radical change?, even if it is the revival of an old idea or system ; and the OIT, when it is accepted, will certainly introduce a radical change in the writing of world history. 

? 

Fournet objects to the word ?revolutionary? above, and later on also to the phrase ?new hypothesis?: ? the OIT is not a ?new hypothesis? (p.XIX) but one of the oldest theories dismissed more than a century ago ?, and even quotes in detail two eighteenth-nineteenth century European writers who need not concern us here (incidentally, for some unknown reason he chooses to quote a writer who advocates the ? vast plateau of Iran ? rather than India as the homeland!). Here Fournet deliberately obfuscates the meaning of what I have written: I have not claimed that the OIT itself is a ? new hypothesis ? but that the particular OIT hypothesis presented in my book is one: the full sentence used by me on p.XIX, which Fournet does not quote, is as follows: ? it is easier to attack the nonsensical notions and wishful writings of more casual or biased OIT writers than to deal with a logical and unassailable new hypothesis backed by a solid phalanx of facts and data ?. My hypothesis (as opposed to the ?Sanskrit-origin? hypotheses of most OIT writers) is a new ?PIE-in-India? hypothesis backed by a completely new and unassailable range of data, evidence and arguments. 

? 

The monologue on AIT-vs.-OIT contains many such ?time pass? comments and objections [It also contains a longish illustration of the writings of some eighteenth century French writer, which we can safely ignore]: 

? 

Fournet basically objects to the very terms OIT and AIT. He attributes this ? creation of an alternative between OIT or AIT ? to the OIT writers: he calls the AIT a label ? created by the OIT supporters ?, and refers to the OIT as ? what is called the ?Out of India Theory? by the author and the other OIT supporters. It can be added that the same name is used by the non supporters to describe the OIT ?. So far as the term OIT is concerned, it was actually coined by the AIT writers themselves (perhaps to rhyme with AIT): it was not used by me even once in my two earlier books. So I cannot answer for this term. 

? 

But, the phrase ?Aryan Invasion Theory? ? shortened to AIT again by the AIT writers themselves ? was first used, in the present debate, by me in the title of my first book in 1993, ?The Aryan Invasion Theory and Indian Nationalism?. So let us see Fournet?s querulous objections to this term: 

? 

Firstly, Fournet objects to this alternative between OIT and AIT since it lumps together all the other homeland theories other than the Indian homeland theory ? as if there were only one non Out-of-India Theory ?, clearly because it gives the Indian homeland theory a special position vis-?-vis the other homeland theories. But he deduces the answer to this objection himself in his Hercule Fournetian manner: ? A plausible explanation is that the author lumps together all these divergent theories into ?the AIT side? because they all share the feature of having Vedic and its present day daughter languages come from somewhere else than the present-day borders of India ?. Fournet does not realize how valid this explanation is (although his use of the phrase ? daughter languages ? shows he has not read pp.281-288 of my book, and is unaware of or oblivious to the complexities of so-called ?Indo-Aryan? linguistics): while the homeland debate on the linguistic side is primarily concerned with linguistic change and development and not with geography-specific data, the debate on the textual and inscriptional side is based primarily on the data in the Indo-Aryan Rigveda and the Iranian Avesta and secondarily on the data in the Hittite and (again Indo-Aryan) Mitanni-Kassite records, all of which are geography-specific. The Rigveda has been interpreted throughout as the record of the Vedic Aryans moving into the Vedic territory from the northwest/north/west. In this alleged movement, whether they originally, before they allegedly entered this territory from the northwest/north/west , came from South Russia, Anatolia, Eastern Europe or the North Pole, or somewhere else, is a negligible point in the data analysis, so all these homeland theories fall in one category. But if it is shown that they actually moved into this territory from the east/southeast , then the only homeland theory indicated, i.e. the Indian homeland theory, or OIT, obviously falls into a distinctly second alternative category. 

? 

But Fournet also objects to the term AIT because of the word ?invasion? inherent in it. He tells us the AIT label ? created by the OIT supporters ? is ? not far from being a libel ? when it is ? used to describe present day scholarship?, since ?this kind of invasionist schemes was very much fashionable in the good old days of European colonialism [?] it has become unpalatable to everybody at the beginning of XXIst century ?. This kind of objection is only to be expected from Fournet, who has clearly not read the numerous internet debates in which the tendency of AIT writers to use terms like ?migration? and ?trickling-in?, even while they describe blatantly invasionist scenarios in detail, has been repeatedly exposed. He could read pps.317-322 of my book, for starters, very, very carefully ? particularly p.322. 

? 

Like a na?ve child, Fournet also puts forward this objection: ? India did not exist thousands of years ago as a state and did not have (its present-day) borders ?, so we cannot describe an invasion ?of India ? in that remote period, nor perhaps talk of an ?Indian? homeland. So until we can specify with documentary proof what exactly every place in the world was named in the remote period under discussion, every geographical statement by us about that period using present-day geographical terms becomes redundant and wrong! If we prove that the original homeland was within India , we are of course wrong because there was no ? India ? with ? (its present-day) borders ? at that time. Of course, when Fournet talks about ? Southern Russia ?, ? Anatolia ?, ? Balkans ?, and so on, all these territories existed since eternity with their ?present-day? borders and names! ? 

? 

Fournet further fine-hones his objection: ? the concept of invasion, i.e. an instantaneous and conscious trespassing of an established state border, is absurd when dealing with Vedic times and the Antiquity (of whatever place) ?. How innocent and idyllic! Fournet is of course, unaware that the recorded history of West Asia ? even before the date of 1500 BCE postulated for the alleged Aryan invasion ? is full of descriptions of established states ( Egypt , Assyria , Persia , etc.) invading the territories of other established states. Or of the detailed descriptions in the Bible of the Jews coming from Egypt and invading established states in Palestine . And, certainly, of the fact that the Rigveda itself, in the description of the battle of the ten kings (which Fournet only encounters on the last page of my book), describes Sudas? invasion of the established states of the Anus. The city-states of the Indus Valley , whatever their identity, were certainly ?established states? before 1500 BCE, and it is their alleged invasion that the AIT definitely describes. 

? 

Fournet uses the word ? libel ? to describe the use of the term AIT by the OIT writers; but indulges in genuinely libelous allegations himself without any compunctions: ? the reader is faced with the Orwellian threat that all the researches on the PIE homeland for centuries amount to an attempt to ?stifle the truth? (p.XXXIV) [?] or ?an all-out Goebbelsian campaign? (p.116) ?. Actually, on p.XXXIV, I have written: ? however much the entrenched AIT scholarship may succeed in stifling the truth today, they will not be able to do so for too long ?. I am talking of the present day pack of jokers like Witzel and Farmer (and now Fournet) and the entrenched political ?scholars? in Indian and western academia who will try to stifle the truth written in my present book (published in the year 2008). And, on p.116, I am talking about the all-out Goebbelsian campaign (a very mild term in the circumstances) in present day India to deny the very existence of a Sarasvati river which flowed through ancient India . Neither of the two instances refers to ? all the researches on the PIE homeland for centuries ?. The second expressly cannot, since I expressly point out on p.116 that this Goebbelsian campaign goes against what ? all the researches for centuries ? have unanimously upheld! 

? 

Further, I have not only never accused two centuries of scholarship of trying to ? stifle the truth ?, but I have frequently expressly dissociated myself from the tendency of many OIT writers to see a colonial conspiracy in the writings of the early AIT scholars. In my first book (1993), I have given the history of the AIT without even hinting that it was anything but a purely academic theory in its origins. In my second book (2000), I have expressly pointed out that the western Indological scholars ? were, by and large, reasonably honest; and although they were often wrong, they were naturally wrong and not deliberately so ? (p.404). In fact, I am quite certain that most of these Indologists, if they had been alive today, would not only have been deeply interested in, but even genuinely excited about, the masses of original data and conclusions given in the first section of my third book under discussion; and many would have accepted my conclusions and treated my book as a starting point for new lines of research. Even if this sounds unlikely to the reader, it should at least be clear from all this that Fournet?s accusation that I have claimed that ? all the researches on the PIE homeland for centuries amount to an attempt to ?stifle the truth? ? is nothing but pure libel. 

? 

???? ? 

6. The Mitanni evidence : After the above monologue on the terms AIT and OIT, Fournet takes up his casual dismissal of the massive data and evidence in the first section of my book, already dealt with in the first section of this reply. We will only take up here some specific grouses about the Mitanni evidence. 

? 

Fournet dismisses the unassailable evidence of the Mitanni names in chapter five, which fits in perfectly with the identical evidence of the Avestan nanes in chapter one , with the hypocritical and escapist charge that these are ? limited lexical items written in a fairly obscure graphic system ?. Typically, he expects to get away with a vague and unsubstantiated objection, and does not have the guts to point out exactly which, and how many, of the Mitanni names and name types listed by me are not actually there in the Mitanni data, and have only been invented by me or have been wrongly imagined as IA names by various western academic scholars due to a wrong reading of the ? obscure graphic system ? in which they were written. 

? 

Fournet tells us: ? One of the few clear features is /azda/ attested in -1500BC in this Mitanni Indo-Aryan-oid language versus /eda/ attested one thousand years later in Vedic ?. He later adds: ? The phonetic change from Indo-Iranian */azda/ to Rig-Vedic /eda/ was already completed when the Rigveda was composed ?. Apart from Fournet?s new implied dating of the Rigveda to 500 BCE, this statement shows that he has not read my chapter very carefully. Unlike Fournet, who must have traveled back in time in a time machine to observe the Rigveda as it was pronounced when it was being composed, most other scholars believe that the Rigveda underwent phonetic changes between the time its various parts were composed and the time the text received its final form. Witzel puts it succinctly: ? certain sounds ? but not words, tonal accents, sentences ? have changed ?. Therefore, it is the ? limited lexical items ? in Mitanni , and not the sounds written in ? a fairly obscure graphic system ?, which can help us in placing the chronological position of the ancestral Mitanni ? Indo-Aryan-oid language ? vis-?-vis the Rigveda. 

? 

Fournet has one more grouse: ? Moreover, the author does not address the issue of how Indo-Aryans coming from India could have moved through Iranians until reaching eastern Anatolia ?. Fournet is apparently unaware of the fact that, in the history of mankind, countless peoples and tribes have migrated from one part of the world to another, ? moving through ? countless other peoples and tribes in the process. It is not clear exactly how and why this joker wanted me to ? address ? this ? issue ?. But, in the process, Fournet provides an alternative answer to his main objection about the /azda/ in Mitanni : this phonetic feature may, alternately, have been borrowed by the Mitanni ancestors from the Iranians during the period of sojourn and interaction with them as they ? moved through ? them. [Yes, phonetic features are borrowed by languages from other languages, although Fournet may act na?ve and innocent on this point as well. Even very unlikely features can be borrowed even from unrelated languages, like the tonal accents borrowed by the Vietnamese branch of the Austric languages from neighbouring Sino-Tibetan, or the clicking sounds borrowed by some non-Khoisan languages of South Africa from the Khoisan languages]. 

? 

The lexical evidence, if ? limited ?, is total and uni-directional , and is supported by the exactly identical and massive evidence of the Avestan names in chapter one. And it is unassailable evidence. And no amount of blustering can change this fact. 




? 

7. ?Indo-Iranian? : Next in line in Fournet?s review is a longish monologue on the term and concept of ?Indo-Iranian?. It starts with a rejection of my 2000 year period for the composition of the Rigveda. Now the western scholars and I are both in agreement that the final point of composition of the Rigveda was somewhere in the mid-second millennium BCE. But the western scholars place the beginnings of the composition of the Rigveda also somewhere in the same period, and have a total span for the period of composition as a few centuries in the second half of the second millennium BCE. I have shown in Section I of my book that the beginnings of the composition of the hymns of the Late Books of the Rigveda go back deep into the third millennium BCE: I will not repeat all the data and evidence here since it is unassailable evidence which has been presented in full detail in my book for anyone to see. The composition of the Middle Books and before that of the Early Books must therefore go back much further. My period of 2000 years is therefore closer to the truth than the few centuries of the western scholars. There is no sense in bandying polemical arguments on this subject with a polemicist like Fournet. 

? 

The rest of the monologue is a vicious and mindless diatribe against what Fournet wants his readers to believe is my ? fixist and anti-evolutionist ? portrayal of the ?Indo-Iranians? [Taking a leaf out of Fournet?s book, I counted the number of times this picturesque polemical phrase is used in the review, and counted no less than seven occurrences, in which my ? mind-set ? (twice), my ? framework ? (thrice), my ? stance ? (once), and my ? approach ? (once), are all classified as ? fixist and anti-evolutionist ?]. His main claim is that I deny both the existence of the Indo-Iranians as a ? unique ethnocultural community ? as well as the inherited Indo-European heritage. But all this repetitive ranting and raving is best read in his own colourful words: ?
