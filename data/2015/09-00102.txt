[INDOLOGY] Fwd: letter of vedanta seminar
Dear Gayathri,
In the official letter announcing this Vedanta seminar, obviously on
Advaita Vedanta, the third and fourth paragraphs say:
"The schools of philosophy founded and propagated by the Gurus like Vyasa,
Sankara, and Sureswaracharya are some of the best available systems of
Indian philosophy. They have embellished the Upanishads to establish their
authenticity.
"However, this great Indian tradition is on the wane due to some selfish,
reprobate and untruthful preceptors. This situation has provided a perfect
launch pad for the divine manifested disciple of Sree Govinda Bhagavatpada,
the peerless seer, Srimad Adi Sankaracharya, who has restored the sanctity
of this great Indian tradition through his teachings of Advaita Philosophy
? Monism or Non-Dualism to bring out the real radiance of Truth of the
beautiful Soul."
Do you know who they mean by "some selfish, reprobate and untruthful
preceptors"? Thanks.
Best regards,
