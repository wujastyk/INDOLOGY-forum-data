[INDOLOGY] Fwd: Morphomata Fellowship Program 2015/2016 - Call for	Applications
The Cologne Morphomata project is exceptionally interesting and
wide-ranging.  A really good group of interesting people.  I am certain
that the selectors would not turn a hair at applications from indologists,
as long as they fitted the other criteria specified.
