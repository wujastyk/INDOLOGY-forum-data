> When you were a baby, you enjoyed taking showers with turmeric (manjaL)
> smeared  all over. decorated using cosmetics (mai/anjana) and 
> consumed milk/juices taht are essential for healthy growth.

> 2) As for the sweet Tamil, the meaning is:
> All your treasures/literatures in palmleaves are protected with
> turmeric, the letters on palmleaves are coated with soot (mai/anjana)
> to make the writing more visible, and in the early stages of life,
> Valluvar's KuRaL nourished you! (muppAl is another name for the

> The second example comes from ParanjOti Munivar's tiruviLaiyATal
