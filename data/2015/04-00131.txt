[INDOLOGY] Help with ABORI
Dear friends,
Our colleague Eli Franco has kindly sent me the following reference in response to my recent query
B.A.Saletore, "Historical notices of the Lokayatas", ABORI 23, 1942,
386-397. 
The problem is that the JSTOR archive of the ABORI skips vol. XXIII (1942) altogether, and I 
therefore unable to access the article in this way. 
If anyone can send me a pdf, I would be most grateful.
thanks in advance,
Matthew
