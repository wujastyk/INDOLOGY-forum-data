[INDOLOGY] Tagore, Aurobindo, and Malhotra
There is perhaps a distinction between being a spiritual practitioner and being an advocate. But in my experience neither excludes genuine scholarship, and I would regret it if people such as Howard were to feel they had to withdraw from the list. We need a plurality of perspectives. 
In any case, I suspect there are quite a few people on the list who would have to withdraw if that criterion were applied systematically.
The level of rhetorical aggression displayed on the list over the last few days seems to me both inappropriate and thoroughly uncollegial.

Re: [INDOLOGY] Tagore, Aurobindo, and Malhotra
Ironically, when Malhotra argues that a non-believer, or non-practitioner, is unqualified to analyze a religious or spiritual tradition, many on this list respond with an almost vicious attack on him. Yet when someone on the List claims that a spiritual practioner, and advocate, cannot be a good academic scholar, apriori, this apparently is acceptable.
If this is indeed the case, I will respectfully withdraw from the List.
Best,
Howard
