Dear Colleagues,According to Panini's Grammar it is well advisable that we accept Prapyate as a passive form of causative prapayati.Then it is construed with the accusative form svargam.It has also been suggested by Prof Cardona.Thanks,Girish K.

Of all the explanations I have received, this one seems most convincing, and especially the example from Manu seems like a good parallel.? Thanks, Hans.

Hi, Madhav.
If pr?pyate?is construed as a verb of motion (in the sense ?reach?), the structure has precedents; compare the structure below, which shows that with verbs of motion the goal is not always construed as object in post-Vedic. Of course, the parallel with?labhate?might suggest an interpretation ?obtain?. In that case (i.e., if it is not to be taken as a motion verb), there may be a parallel in late Sanskrit (one of the versions of the Vet?lapa?cavi??ati, perhaps the one edited by Uhle); unfortunately I can?t find the exact reference.
sabh?m v? na prave??avyam (Manu 8.13)
All the best for the New Year,
Hans

n a Sanskrit work titled Nity?c?radarpa?a by Brahm?nanda, on p. 2, I see a quotation from Dak?asm?ti:

??????????? ???????????????? ?????: ?
???????????????? ??????????????????????? ????? ??

Here, ?c?r?t pr?pyate svargam is an irregular usage, unless one assumes that the word svarga is somehow used in neuter gender.? With the normal masculine gender of the word svarga, svargam would be an accusative case form, and this does not fit well with the passive verb.? In Marathi, such passive constructions are possible: ?????? (instrumental) ??????? (accusative) ?????? (passive verb).? This usage alternates with a more Sanskrit like passive: ?????? ???? (nom) ??????/????? (nom).? I am wondering if anyone has come across Sanskrit passive (bh?ve) constructions where the object shows up in the accusative case.? Any information or suggestions are appreciated.
