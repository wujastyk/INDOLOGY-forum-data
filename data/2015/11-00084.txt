Dear List,

Could anybody shed light on the environmental humanities and its relation
to or influence on the formation of classical knowledge system and vice
versa, including the contemporary or pre-modern environmental debate in
relation to the socio-political-religious formations connected to the
regional systems in South and East Asia and Europe?

Sharing of any articles and links will be highly appreciated.



With regards,
Niranjan Saha
