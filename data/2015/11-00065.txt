The Buddhist parallel of this act has been described in many modern works.
Snellgrove is well-known. Less known is Lama Anagarika Govinda,
*Foundations* *of* *Tibetan* *Mysticism* London, 1959. The ??kta Tantric
ritual will be found, among others, in the ??kt?nandatarangi?? by
Brahm?nanda Giri, (ed. Panchanan Shastri,Calcutta 1942-43, in Bengali
character and with Bengali translation ) Ch. 4. Giri closely follows the
*??rad?tilakatantra*. Gopinath Kaviraj, *Bharatiya* *Sadhanar* *Dhara*
(Bengali), Sanskrit College, Calcutta,1965 96ff gives interesting details
without exact reference. But Kaviraj is entirely dependable.
