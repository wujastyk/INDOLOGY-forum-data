I am reading the Adluri/Bagchee book right now; though not without its
problems, I have to agree with George Hart's assessment.

But, I will also say, as a student of religion (my graduate department had
the rather comprehensive and so, too, largely meaningless name, "Department
of the History and Literature of Religions"), Americans have long struggled
with the precise meaning of "wissenschaftlich."  The 19th century American
world was a direct descendent of the German academy, but lacked its
sophistication.  (Somewhere early in the JAOS I recall that the reason
given for the turn to Oriental studies was to "keep up with the
Joneses"--i.e., the Europeans; not much science there, I am afraid.)

cheers,

Herman Tull
