[INDOLOGY] training in poetic composition in traditional	Sanskrit education?
When Richard Gombrich taught the Sanskrit BA course at Oxford, Sanskrit
composition was an option on the syllabus.  In the finals, one could choose
Sanskrit comp., or instead a longer unseen translation (if I recall
correctly).
I think Skt. composition formed part of the syllabus under Burrow, before
Richard, which would take it back to the war.  I expect before that, it was
also there, Sanskrit being taught on the model of Greats.
I don't know about the present syllabus.
Best,
Dominik Wujastyk
