[INDOLOGY] Fwd:  Lance Cousins
Re: [INDOLOGY] Lance Cousins
I never had the opportunity to meet him in person, but I have always
benefited from reading Lance's papers and his contributions to the Indology
list.  I have long missed his presence on the list.
With all best wishes to his family and friends,
George Thompson
