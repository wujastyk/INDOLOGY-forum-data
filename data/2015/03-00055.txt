Could this be a platform problem? The two qwerty inputs look different on my iPhone, with the second showing a vir?ma

Dear indologists,
We noticed a quirk in the display of puur.n virAma (i.e. in the Sanskrit Library phonetic ascii encoding pUrR = KH pUrN) in Devanagari and wonder whether anyone has seen this display properly in a webpage with the proper characters.  Here is the Devanagari qwerty input:
????? This is p U r f N
?????? This is p U r f N f
As you can see they are identical.
???????? This is p U r f N f f f
Finally the virAma displays, but it should not require three virama characters to do so.
Thanks for your help.
Yours,
Peter
