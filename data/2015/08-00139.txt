[INDOLOGY] Hindi v Sanskrit
Dear Prof. Kulkarni,
 copula : Can this be point of distinction between Dravidian and Indian IE
languages? Vedic, Sanskrit and Prakrits too have the copula-less NP-NP
sentences. Malayalam has the copula aaNu in affirmative NP-NP sentences.
The negative forms of the affirmative NP-NP sentences in almost all
Dravidian languages have copula (kaadu/kaanu/kaavu type). This evidence in
negative sentences leads to the consideration of Ak (Tamil) Agu(Kaannada)
Agu (Telugu) derived copula in the 'ground structure' of the copula-less
surface structures. Does this descriptive consideration have a historical
implication for pre-historic Dravidian syntax?
Bhartrihari in VP calls the copula-less NP-NP sentences in Sanskrit as
'as'rutakriyAvAkya'. At some places he uses expressions such as kriyAs
which are s'rutA or as'rutA. This implies that for Bhartrihari 'kriyA'
(asti/bhavati type) does exist in these sentences in an  as'rutA form.
Can the Vedic Sanskrit Prakrit NP-NP structure be considered as Dravidian
influence?
