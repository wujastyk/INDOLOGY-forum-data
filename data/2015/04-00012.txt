Thank you, Madhav. I'm not sure if your reply reached the Indology list, 
so I'm copying it below. I find it prompts two more questions: first, 
whether Tuk? was a common name before the time of Tuk?r?m, or whether 
people bearing the name today are largely named after him. (Or perhaps 
after the goddess -- is it a name used by both sexes?) And second, 
whether any Dravidian scholar on the list can confirm or deny the 
development ?ukra > tukka (in one or more Dravidian languages -- I'm not 
sure the same sound laws apply everywhere).

'My' author is typically called Tuka, with a single k and short a. In 
one place, however, I did notice the Devan?gar? spelling Tuvaka, where I 
suspect the -vaka may be a misreading for -kka (which in some forms of 
the ligature would look very similar).
