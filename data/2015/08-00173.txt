[INDOLOGY] Setuyatranuvarnana by T. Ganapati Sastri
According to the obituary of  K. G.  ?ankar in the JRAS of 1926 (Issue 3, July 1926, pp. 584-87; http://www.jstor.org/stable/25221050 ), the Setuy?tr?nuvar?anam is to be counted "among his (...) early works, which all remain unpublished" (like his Sanskrit translation of The Merchant of Venice). 
The Harvard exemplar (ex libris Ch. R. Lanman) of the 1st ed. of his Bh?rat?nuvar?anam (Trivandrum: Printers' Jobbing Press, 1905) is available at:
