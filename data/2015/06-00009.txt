Dear Olga,
W. R. Antarkar, who is/was the world's leading expert on the various
?a?kara-vijayas,
in his English Introduction to his Sanskrit edition of Govindan?tha's
*?a?kar?c?ryacaritam* has a few paragraphs about him. This was published in
*Bh**?rat?ya Vidy**?*, vol. 52, 1992, pp. 55-141. If needed, I can send you
a scan of this.
Best regards,
David Reigle
Colorado, U.S.A.
