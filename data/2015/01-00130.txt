Subject: [INDOLOGY] 6th Coffee Break Conference to be held in Rome,	September 2015
Message-ID: <CAEYKMacqe3e+Mvd_V0sif6C6gNifwvqOnDOGEhZ3bh-uSdq6sg@mail.gmail.com>

*Dear friends and colleagues,in case you are considering to visit Rome at
the end of this Summer, here is an additional reason for doing it. Please
consider the following also as an invitation to join a collaborative
enterprise which might be more intriguing and stimulating (and will surely
be more fun) than usual conferences:*
*A Coffee Break Conference on **Comparison and Comparative Method*
Rome, Institute of Oriental Studies, University "Sapienza", 17--19
September 2015

*About the CBCs in general*
The Coffee Break Conference (CBC) project is the result of a larger
reflection on the common sensical statement that "the most interesting
parts of a conference are the coffee breaks". One yawns or falls asleep
while most papers are read ? apart from a couple of them and one's own one.
By contrast, one often takes part of challenging and fascinating debates
while sipping at a cup of tea or coffee. Often, the same papers sound
thought-provoking and insightful during the breaks, and extremely boring
while they are actually read. Therefore, what a "coffee break conference"
aims at is to leave behind the rigidity and formality of the official
academic and scholarly meetings and to favour an open-minded exchange of
ideas, suggestions, discussions and criticisms, within the spirit of a
friendly dialogue held in an informal atmosphere.
