[INDOLOGY] Ayurvedic query
<Is there anything in Ayurvedic medicine texts on the value of plant nectar
as a medicinal material ?>
ku.s.tha = saussurea lappa has been termed am.rta in the Atharvaveda. It is
said to grow in heaven which was none other than the Kullu district in the
Himachal Pradesh. According to the AV this was to be used as an
anti-piretic drug. Its utility was forgotten later and is now used for
indigestion by traditional physicians in the Himachal Pradesh..  The matter
was brought to notice by me in 2005 -- Indische Kultur im Kontext
Harrassowitz Verlag Wiesbaden:9-29.
Will this be useful?
