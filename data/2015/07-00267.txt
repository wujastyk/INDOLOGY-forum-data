[INDOLOGY] Tagore, Aurobindo, and Malhotra
Ironically, when Malhotra argues that a non-believer, or non-practitioner, is unqualified to analyze a religious or spiritual tradition, many on this list respond with an almost vicious attack on him. Yet when someone on the List claims that a spiritual practioner, and advocate, cannot be a good academic scholar, apriori, this apparently is acceptable.
If this is indeed the case, I will respectfully withdraw from the List.
Best,
