Thank you!!!
I wish our esteemed colleagues could understand and realize the seriousness of the academic situation while they keep silence out of politeness or politics. 
I am personally offended by the behavior of some of my Western colleagues who go for easy access through a ?native informant? and then be held and celebrated almost as a ?god? and enjoy such artificial stature.
In this particular case ? serious attention is needed by forum owners, owners of online discussion groups, and so on to be watchful for plagiarism, manipulations, distortions, monopolizing,  ? and you name it.
Thanks and regards,
Rajam
