Dear Alessandro,

If you're collecting proverbs that say "Even Brahma..." there's this, which sums up a 
magnificent story of love, politics, and social and theological subversion:

suprayuktasya dambhasya brahmApy antaM na gacchati | kauliko vizNurUpeNa rAjakanyAM 
nizevate ||

"Even Brahma does not get to the bottom of a well-conducted fraud: the weaver in the form 
of Vishnu cohabited with the princess."

(Purnabhadra's version of the Pancatantra (J. Hertel, The Panchatantra: A Collection of 
Ancient Indian Tales in the Recension called Panchakhyanaka, Cambridge, MA (USA), 
Harvard University Press, 1908, p.46) 

Yours,

Dermot Killingley

Dear Members of the list, 

In Kayyaa's commentary to the Devi?sataka (v.1) I have come across the following 
expression: krodhavtasau kamate na dhatu ("the one who is overcome by rage doesn't 
forgive even Brahma", or something like that). This half-?sloka is quoted to strengthen the 
idea that Brahma is the non plus ultra of something ("if even Brahma doesn't know, who else 
will?").
I assume this is the second part of some wise saying, or a reference to some laukikanyaya: 
is any of you able to trace the missing part/the source of this proverb, or point me to similar 
sayings concerning Brahma? Thank you!
Best,
