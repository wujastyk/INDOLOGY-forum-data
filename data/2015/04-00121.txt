[INDOLOGY] Indian printed books
Thank you.  Beautiful catalog of a private collection that was offered 
for sale en bloc, written by Graham Shaw, the now retired British expert 
on the history of printing in India.  Does anyone know who was the 
collector, if the sale went through, and, if it did, who acquired this 
collection?
