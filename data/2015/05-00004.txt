[INDOLOGY] INDOLOGY Digest, Vol 28, Issue 3
Dear Admin
thanks for posting my request again. However I have already received  the
pdf of Luder's Mathura Inscription. I express my gratitude to all the
members who immediately share the almost impossible to trace documents from
all corners of the world.
regards
