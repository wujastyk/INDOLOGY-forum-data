[INDOLOGY] Administrative message: Bounce / account disabled	messages
Dear colleagues,
We've been seeing some funny behaviour from the Mailman software that
powers the INDOLOGY list.  It seems that a single post from a member with a
Yahoo email account can trigger a cascade of problems affecting other
people's accounts.  It's not anybody's fault - it's the software.
The INDOLOGY committee has investigated, and we have applied a technical
fix for the problem.  As far as we can tell, things are calm again.
If you have had a message in the last few weeks saying that your INDOLOGY
account has been suspended due to bounce processing, you can ignore it.
We've re-subscribed all the accounts that inadvertantly got suspended.
Sorry for any alarm or inconvenience!
The INDOLOGY committee
PS If you want the nitty-gritty, it was probably a DMARC issue caused by
the email-processing policies of Yahoo and AOL that some have called
"irresponsible."
