Subject: [INDOLOGY] Administrative message: Bounce / account disabled	messages
Message-ID: <CAKdt-Ceu7zo8faM+O+Viw0McvNRnBi4TCQVVRVHNDv6J6C0wkw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear colleagues,

We've been seeing some funny behaviour from the Mailman software that
powers the INDOLOGY list.  It seems that a single post from a member with a
Yahoo email account can trigger a cascade of problems affecting other
people's accounts.  It's not anybody's fault - it's the software.

The INDOLOGY committee has investigated, and we have applied a technical
fix for the problem.  As far as we can tell, things are calm again.

If you have had a message in the last few weeks saying that your INDOLOGY
account has been suspended due to bounce processing, you can ignore it.
We've re-subscribed all the accounts that inadvertantly got suspended.

Sorry for any alarm or inconvenience!

The INDOLOGY committee

PS If you want the nitty-gritty, it was probably a DMARC issue caused by
the email-processing policies of Yahoo and AOL that some have called
"irresponsible."
