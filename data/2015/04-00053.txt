Subject: [INDOLOGY] Prohibition of sea travel
Message-ID: <CAFZJJzGxkBbNf89=Q78sawPZD4iC=JODZUwhAY+m8wMWa5Az1A@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Indologists,

A quick question on behalf of a colleague: can you please point me to a few
articles discussing and contextualizing the prohibition of sea travel
expressed in the dharma??stra literature (such as at Laws of Manu 3.158)?

Many thanks,
Andrew
