[INDOLOGY] Scan of R. K. Kamats edition of Gur-caritra needed
Dear list members,
If anyone has a scan of R.K. Kamat's edition of the Guru-caritra first
published in 1937 could they please forward it to me.  I need a version
that includes his preface.  (I've seen some reprints that don't include
this).
Thanks,
Harry Spier
