[INDOLOGY] rubrication in Indian mss.
Dear Dominic,
m?tsn? has also the technical meaning of an "aluminous slate" (MW : "Lit. Bhpr.") like both m?d (L.), m?ts? (L.) m?ttik? (Lit. L.) and bh?ghn? ? could it mean a tablet for writing upon ?
An interesting comment (not directly relevant here) is to be found in Rhys Davids & Stede's Pali-English Dictionary s.v. cu??a (= skrt c?r?a) as powder : "often combined with mattik? (= skrt m?ttik?; s.v., plur. as "kinds of clay used in cosmetics, like Fuller's earth") clay, in distinction of which c. is for delicate use (tender skin), whereas m. for rougher purposes".
Best wishes,
Christophe
