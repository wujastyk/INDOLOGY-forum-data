A brief description of the conference:
The early modern period in India, roughly the 15th-18th centuries,
witnessed an explosion of textual production in vernacular languages
alongside the ongoing vibrancy of cosmopolitan traditions. These literary
trends were accompanied by a wide range of changes concerning readership
communities, circulation patterns, and social identities. This conference
focuses on some of the major literary developments during this dynamic
period and highlights fresh avenues of research for investigating
relationships between linguistic traditions and reading communities.
