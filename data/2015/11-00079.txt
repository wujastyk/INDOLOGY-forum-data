Subject: [INDOLOGY] tunes/melodies used for chanting Sanskrit verse
Message-ID: <CAEjEOsB37=-cYKqA2ztf_UNpCXA5uM_ujU2e-JZqjXUStOJtuA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I've been looking for a source (online or printed) on the different tunes
used to chant the various Sanskrit meters. Do any of you know whether
something like that exists, or whether these are only passed on orally?

Many thanks,
     Antonia
