[INDOLOGY] Vedic verse in Ortega y Gasset
Regarding the gayatri mantra, here is an interesting old story:
My wife when she was a young girl spent many summer days visiting her
cousins in a town in upstate New York [called Nyack].  The house that they
lived in back then used to belong to a fellow who called himself "Oom the
Omnipotent."  He was also known as Pierre Bernard.  He was a very popular
yogi in New York in the early 20th century, attracting lots of wealthy
ladies, especially young ones.  He was also the uncle of Theos Bernard,
also a popular scholar of yoga.  A book was written a few years ago about
Oom, or Pierre, and his scandalous life.  I have it somewhere but I can not
find it.  For those who are curious to learn more about him, there is an
article in Wikipedia.
These cousins knew about Oom's reputation and they knew that there was a
Sanskrit inscription carved into a wooden beam somewhere in their house.
When they learned, 40 years ago, that I was a student of Sanskrit, they
painstakingly copied the devanagari text and
mailed it to me.
It started: tat savitur varenyam ... etc.
Best wishes,
George
