[INDOLOGY] Mss. from Rotkuppelraum, Qyzyl
Re: [INDOLOGY] Mss. from Rotkuppelraum, Qyzyl
Dear Prof. Salomon,
I'd also recommend
Malzahn, Melanie (ed.). 2007. Instrumenta Tocharica. Heidelberg: Winter.
It has a chapter on the expeditions by Hannes Fellner and five chapters on collections and concordances.
The Comprehensive Edition of Tocharian Manuscripts (CEToM) is also extremely useful: https://www.univie.ac.at/tocharian/.
If this doesn't do the trick, let me know, and I'll put you in touch with a real Tocharian specialist.
Best wishes,
Dieter Gunkel

Rich,
Did you check the following?
L. Sander, Pal?ographisches zu den Sanskrithandschriften der Berliner Turfansammlung, (Wiesbaden 1968), pp. 7-21.  This is excerpted in Tatsami Tarai?s 2010 dissertation:
http://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/14507708.pdf
In Eli Franco?s The Spitzer Manuscript: The Oldest Philosophical Manuscript in Sanskrit (Vienna, 2004), pp. 1-2, he mentions that Gr?nwedel (in Altbuddhistische Kultst?tten in Chinesisch-Turkistan, pp. 82 ff.) disputed von le Coq?s *description of the location of the library* (in Von Land und Leuten in Ostturkistan).  Gr?nwedel can be consulted here:

Try a search such as this one in the Digital Silk Road Project?s Digital Archive of Toyo Bunko Rare Books

Does anyone happen to know of a detailed description of the
circumstances of discovery of Sanskrit and Tocharian manuscripts in the
"Rotkuppelraum" at Qyzyl by A. von le Coq? (This is only very cursorily
described in his "Buried Treasures of Chinese Turkestan", p.126 of the
English version.)
Also, is there a convenient comprehensive list of the manuscripts that
came from this cave?
Thanks
