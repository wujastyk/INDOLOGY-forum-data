Subject: [INDOLOGY] Ananya Vajpeyi on Hindutva, caste,	and Brahminical values

Dear friends,

Perhaps those of us interested in sharing empirical data on violence
against minorities in India can follow up on this thread off-list, since we
seem to be veering a bit away from the discussion of Dr. Vajpeyi's actual
argument, and into different territory.

As for me, the question about empirical sources (which do agree that
religious minorities, particular castes, women and ethnic minorities suffer
violence in India from particular groups of actors; the extent of that
violence seems to be the issue in question) is not as interesting as the
type of question that Vajpeyi raises: how is it that the violence
perpetrated by groups of non-state actors is made legible as 'caste
hierarchy enforcement', 'communal violence', and so forth through
structural and ideological alliances between the aforementioned groups (the
Sri Ram Sena, RSS, etc.) with the state (in this case, the BJP-ruled
government)?  In other words, there is plenty of empirical evidence that
violence is perpetrated upon these groups, that is not the object of
debate; the question is how these are all read by the public-- including
the victims themselves-- as a kind of cultural policing in the service of
building a Hindu nation.

We of course would not want any of our colleagues to feel that India or the
Indian government are being singled out for criticism; similar problems are
present in many of our countries, and a matter of equal concern.

But just as one cannot condone, say, the refusal to acknowledge that gun
violence exists in the United States and has claimed the lives of many
people, I find it difficult to condone a position that seeks to deny the
existence of violence in India against religious minorities, women, certain
castes, and again, scholars who hold certain views.  Such a lack of
compassion is, frankly, frightening.

Respectfully,
Tyler
