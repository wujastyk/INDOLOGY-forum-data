[INDOLOGY] regarding Malhotra's plaguerism
Dr. Al Collins,
If you saw any specific reason in attaching your ?Jul 18, 2015, at 3:03 PM? post to mine of ?Jul 18, 2015 at 9:50 AM,? it escapes me. The title with ?plaguerism? for ?plagiarism? came from Dr. George Thompson. I retained it only to ensure that the relation of my post to his is not lost. This is a common custom of Internet discussion groups as you must know. 
The style in which you express your impression or evaluation of Mr. Malhotra is remarkable, but if the post had gone beyond mere assertions and contained what members of this forum consider as evidence or reasoning, it would have interested me. 
a.a.
