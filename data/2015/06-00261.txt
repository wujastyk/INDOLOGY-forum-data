Dear George,

This brings to mind a question. In the Tamil Sangam texts, the fast gait (gallop, canter?) of a horse is called ?di (Tamil ?ti), always in the context of pulling a chariot. It would appear that people had some familiarity with Sanskrit texts on horse training.  It would be interesting (though, of course, unlikely) if the Hittite equivalent of that term appears in Kikkuli?s treatise, as that would suggest origins way back in PIE. Does anyone have any idea whether ?di is used in Sanskrit texts on horses and if so where? I?m not sure when horses first appeared in the Tamil area. Thanks, George

The horse-training book was written by someone named Kikkuli, and he wrote it in Hittite, not Vedic.  In his Hittite horse-training manual there are some clearly pre-Vedic words that refer to horse-training and certain Vedic gods.  Kikkuli was transcribing into Hittite the words of these pre-Vedic nomads who taught the Hittites about horse-training.

Its main point is that the OIT theory is not supported by any good evidence.  It cites reliable sources like Anthony and the encyclopedia of IE by Mallory and Adams.  If you want to consider what Vedicists think about this, see Mayrhofer and Thieme, just as a start.
