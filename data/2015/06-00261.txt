[INDOLOGY] Fun media piece about the Mitanni: Sanskrit in	Ancient Syria
Dear George,
This brings to mind a question. In the Tamil Sangam texts, the fast gait (gallop, canter?) of a horse is called ?di (Tamil ?ti), always in the context of pulling a chariot. It would appear that people had some familiarity with Sanskrit texts on horse training.  It would be interesting (though, of course, unlikely) if the Hittite equivalent of that term appears in Kikkuli?s treatise, as that would suggest origins way back in PIE. Does anyone have any idea whether ?di is used in Sanskrit texts on horses and if so where? I?m not sure when horses first appeared in the Tamil area. Thanks, George
