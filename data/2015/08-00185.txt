Dear all,
from the Indian viewpoint the motif of external soul was long ago discussed by Ruth Norton:
?The Life-Index: A Hindu Fiction Motif?, Studies in honor of Maurice Bloomfield. New Haven 1920, 211?224.    

Best,
Klaus

It is all truly exciting, and yet another lesson to us scholars not to neglect the influence of non-written sources on visual tellers.

The ?soul in bee? motif is not confined to the R?ma tradition: other examples are listed in The Oral Tales of India by Stith Thompson and Jonas Balys (Bloomington: Indiana U P, 1958) as motif E715.3, so there is no question of direct influence.

His celibacy as a qualification for special prowess (usually expressed as not having seen a woman?s face since the exile, and so unavailable to R?ma) is generally associated with being able to see the invisible Indrajit.
