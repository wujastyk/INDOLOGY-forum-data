[INDOLOGY] ranbir singh research institute catalogue
Dear Members,
I am looking for a pdf of Aurel Stein's
*Catalogue of the Sanskrit manuscripts in the Raghunath temple library of
His Highness the Maharaja of Jammu & Kashmir.*
I have consulted such catalogue in Jammu, but was unable to take pictures.
I am also aware of a *Descriptive catalogue* compiled in recent times by
M.M. Patkar, D. Shastri, K.K. Mishra and published by the same institution.
Is anyone able to help?
Best,
Alessandro Battistini
