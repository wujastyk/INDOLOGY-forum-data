Subject: [INDOLOGY] Sparkling new book on Vietnamese traditional medicine
Message-ID: <008f01d0b387$a23b8170$e6b28450$@spro.net>

Dear all,
I hasten to post this book information FYI. Like ancient Indian and Greek
medicine, Chinese and (I'm guessing as I don't have the book yet) also
Vietnamese traditional medicine had a humoral basis. This is my excuse for
calling it to your attention on this list:
_Vietnamese Traditional Medicine: A Social History_, by C. Michele Thompson.
NUS Press, 2015. The delightful cover is from a painting specially created
for the author by Nguyen The Khang, based on a medical shop in his
neighborhood in the 20's and 30's.
