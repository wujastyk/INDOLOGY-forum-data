Dear Members,
I am looking for a scan of this book in 3 vols.:
Sa?hityaratna?kara of Dharmasu?ri : with Nauka? of Carla Ven?kat?asu?ri and
Mandara of Malla?di Laks?man?a Su?riSanskrit Academy series ; 21, 22,
24; Hyderabad
: Osmania University
As I am looking for a particular passage (6.14) dealing with the
construction of n?gabandhas, the page concerned will suffice (it should be
in vol.2)...
Anyone willing to share?
Best,
Alessandro Battistini
