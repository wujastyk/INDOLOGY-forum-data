[INDOLOGY] Amartya Sen and Nalanda
Writing from my temporary home in Delhi, those of you interested in the Amartya Sen and Nalanda University fiasco, my profitably read these two essays. The first is by a friend, Pratap Bhanu Mehta (who taught at Harvard). He is a very incisive and insightful public intellectual and analyst of Indian politics and society.
