Collection Indologie n? 129; Early Tantra Series n? 2, Institut Fran?ais

Language: Sanskrit, English. *700 Rs (30 *?*). *ISBN: 978-81-8470-206-4 
(IFP) / 978-2-85539-152-6 (EFEO).

The three works presented in this volume are hitherto unpublished texts 
of great significance for the early history of tantric Vai??avism, and 
we have grounds for supposing that they are older than any hitherto 
published Vai??ava Tantras. They preserve archaic elements not found in 
other Pa?car?tra works, such as Vai??ava /brahma-mantra/s styled after 
the P??upata ones, and the veneration of eight heroes of the V???i clan, 
as well as of the pentad of Var?ha, Narasi?ha, Trivikrama, V?mana, and 
Vasudeva. Their ritual makes profuse use of Vedic mantras, one of them 
even requiring the installation of Vedic hymns (rather than tantric 
mantras!) chosen from each of the ten /ma??ala/s of the /?gveda/ in 
every image of Vi??u. In a spirit rare in the Vai??ava traditions of the 
second millennium, these scriptures call on devotees to identify Brahm?, 
Vi??u and ?iva. They thus present a picture of Tantric Vai??avism in the 
first millennium AD as imbricated with ?aivism and Brahmanism and tell 
us much about the early history of tantrism and of Hinduism in general.

The first and third of these texts are transmitted to us in a single 
palm-leaf manuscript dated to Nepal Samvat 147 (1027 AD), and the second 
in a slightly newer and undated one, both from the treasure trove of the 
National Archives, Kathmandu. This volume contains a first edition of 
these texts with a detailed introduction, including an English synopsis, 
along with text-critical notes and indices, as well as facsimiles of the 
manuscript leaves.
