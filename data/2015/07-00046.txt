[INDOLOGY] Religious Literature with Political Purposes
Very true ? you can take a look at the Chettiar Temple (Thendayuthapani) temple in Singapore: http://www.sttemple.com/sri-thendayuthapani-temple/about-st-temple.html <http://www.sttemple.com/sri-thendayuthapani-temple/about-st-temple.html>. My point is not that Sanskritization does not exist. It obviously does, and it?s a powerful force. My point is rather that scholars studying the dynamics of traditional and modern India need to be careful of seeing too much through the lens of Sanskritization ? which is what the discussion initiated by Nagaraj Paturi was getting at. Also, the dynamics of what we call Sanskritization are not purely Brahmanical. Some elements (vegetarianism) are Jain, some seem indigenous. Not too many go back to the Vedas, I think. Sorry for so many posts today ? I hope I?ve started an interesting discussion and look forward to other comments and ideas on the subject. George
