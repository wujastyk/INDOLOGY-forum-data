[INDOLOGY] Manuscripts in India
I vaguely recall seeing some article a few years back (maybe on the
Indology list) that Google or Microsoft were partnering with a large
manuscript library in India to digitize their collection.  Does anyone
remember which institute this was and what became of the project.
