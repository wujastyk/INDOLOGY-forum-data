In the Y?j?avalkya Sm?ti I find what I think is an unusual phenomenon?a very large number of verses where a compound breaches the p?da boundaries, and quite a large number of verses where one compound spans an entire line (two p?das). I find 9.5% (192 total) of half-verses in YDh following this pattern.

Do you know of any studies done about this phenomenon in other parallel texts in verse? I would like to know whether this is peculiar to Y?j?avalkya or a broader phenomenon. I have not found this common in other Dharma??stras.

With thanks,

Patrick
