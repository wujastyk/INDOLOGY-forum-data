Jain Perceptions of N?th and Ha?ha Yog?s in Pre-Colonial North India

*Author:* John E. Cort

*Year:* 2015

International Journal of Jaina Studies (Online) Vol. 11, No. 4 (2015) 1-22

Toward the end of the Ban?rs? Vil?s, the ?collected works? of Ban?rs?d?s
(1586-1643) that was compiled by his colleague Jagj?vanr?m in 1644, there
is a curious seven-caup?? composition entitled Gorakhn?th ke Vacan, or ?The
Sayings of Gorakhn?th.? The text, which may or may not have been authored
by Ban?rs?d?s, but at the very least provides us with a Jain reception of
 Gorakhn?th?s teachings, gives a very favorable short summary of them. To
the best of my knowledge, no scholarly attention has been focused on this
text. Scholars of Ban?rs?d?s at best simply mention it in passing.
Scholars of Gorakhn?th, and the N?ths seem largely to be ignorant of the
text. A century later, in his Mok?a-m?rg Prak??ak, the Jaipur-based
Ter?panth ideologue ?o?armal (ca. 1719/20-1766/67) included a discussion of
the practices of Ha?ha Yog?s, who most likely were R?m?nand?s.  His
comments were harshly critical of these false practices. Neither account of
these ?Hindu? Yogic practitioners of early modern north India is
sufficiently extensive or detailed to provide useful contemporary evidence
of the details of the practices of these Yogic groups. They do, however,
show us two very different responses to the problem of religious diversity.
While Ban?rs?d?s affirms the superiority of the Jain teachings in other
texts, the inclusion of Gorakhn?th ke Vacan in his Ban?rs? Vil?s shows that
he was a curious spiritual seeker, who could find value in non-Jain
practices and ideas. ?o?armal, on the other hand, was a staunch ideologue,
who exalted the Jain doctrines and denigrated all others.

The Taste of the Mango: A Jaina-Buddhist Controversy on Evidence

*Author:* Marie-H?l?ne Gorisse

*Year:* 2015

International Journal of Jaina Studies (Online) Vol. 11, No. 3 (2015) 1-19

In the classical framework of Indian philosophy, the different schools of
thought agree on the fact that the correctness of an inference relies on a
special necessary relation standing between the evidence-property and the
target-property. In this framework, there is a controversy between Buddhist
and Jain philosophers concerning the marks of this necessary relation,
named the ?invariable concomitance?. More precisely, whereas the Buddhist
philosopher Dharmak?rti holds that only two types of inferential evidence,
namely natural property and effect, can ensure that inferential reasoning
relies upon an invariable concomitance, the Jain M??ikyanandi claims that
there are no less than six situations in which the presence of an
invariable concomitance is unquestionable, namely when the
evidence-property is pervaded by the target-property, or when it is its
effect, its cause, its predecessor, its successor or its co-existent. In
this line, the typical answer from the Buddhist side is to show that any
evidence other than natural property and effect can in fact be traceable to
one of them. Contrarily, the Jain strategy is to show that natural property
and effect are not sufficient in order to give a correct account of the
diversity of correct inferences. The aim of this paper is to give a
presentation of these discrepancies between the Jain and the Buddhist
theories of inference, as they are found in M??ikyanandi?s Par?k??mukham,
the Introduction to Philosophical Investigation, a digest of Akala?ka?s
mature philosophy on one side, and in Dharmak?rti?s
Pram??av?rttikasvav?tti, his Auto-commentary on the Essay on Knowledge on
the other side.

Specific Rule in India for Common Difference as Found in the Gomma?as?ra of
Nemicandra (c. 981)

*Author:* Dipak Jadhav

*Year:* 2015

International Journal of Jaina Studies (Online) Vol. 11, No. 2 (2015) 1-21

This paper brings the formula *d = S ? n?k*  into light and discusses its
various aspects including its context in Jaina philosophy. It was set forth
and utilized by Nemicandra (c. 981) in the *Gomma?as?ra (Karmak???a)* in
order to demonstrate the lower-thought-activity (*adha? prav?tta kara?a*).
The lower-thought-activity is conceived as a special process of
thought-concentration which causes destruction (*k?apa?a*) or suppression (
*upa?amana*) of the sub-classes of conduct-deluding*karma*. The paper also
offers a rationale for this specific formula. The relevance of the formula
lies in the fact that it can be used for generating various arithmetic
progressions by finding the common differences, *d* , in accordance with
various values of an arbitrary number, *k* , while their sums, *S* , and
the numbers of their terms, *n* , remain fixed. This way he used it. It can
also be used for generating various arithmetic progressions by finding  in
accordance with various values of*k * while *n*  and *d* remain fixed and
by finding *n* in accordance with various appropriate values of *k* while
*S* and *d* remain fixed.

can the lifespans of ??abha, Bharata, ?rey??sa, and Ara tell us about the
History of the concept of Mount Meru?

*Author:* Ruth Satinsky

*Year:* 2015

International Journal of Jaina Studies (Online) Vol. 11, No. 1 (2015) 1-24

Willibald Kirfel (1920/1990), in his major study of Indian cosmology, Die
Kosmographie der Inder nach den Quellen dargestellt, compares the
Brahmanical, Buddhist and Jaina cosmological systems, and concludes that
the early Brahmanical cosmology forms the basis of the later cosmology
found in the epics and Pur??as, and that of the Buddhist and Jaina systems,
as well. Contrary to Kirfel, this paper will present some provisional ideas
which suggest that the concept of Mount Meru entered Brahmanical literature
under the influence of the culture out of which Jainism and Buddhism arose,
the culture of Greater Magadha. This hypothesis is based on three
observations: 1) the concept of Mount Meru ("the golden mountain at the
center of the earth and the universe, around which the heavenly bodies
revolve") is prominent in the Jaina and Buddhist canons, but strikingly
absent from Brahmanical literature prior to the Mah?bh?rata; 2) its late
introduction into Brahmanical literature marks the shift from Vedic to epic
and Pur??ic cosmology at a time when Brahmanical contacts with Buddhism,
Jainism, and their region of origin, Greater Magadha, were possible and
presumably established; and 3) a special group of numbers, "the number
eighty-four and its multiples," is also prominent in the Jaina and Buddhist
canons, and in ?j?vikism, but likewise absent from Brahmanical literature
prior to the Mah?bh?rata. The lifespans of ??abha, Bharata, ?rey??sa, and
Ara, and the height of Mount Meru are linked to this special group of
numbers, and will serve, amongst others, as examples.
