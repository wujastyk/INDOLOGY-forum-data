[INDOLOGY] The so-called German Indology
Dear Professor Hart,
may I ask for an example of the "ideas that should be seriously considered by indologists"?
Thanks in advance.

If you search the book at Amazon, you can read significant parts of it (?Look inside this book?). The authors are serious, well-read scholars and have put a colossal amount of work into their effort. The book strikes me as an important contribution whose ideas should be seriously considered by indologists. George Hart

In reading these lines, I get quite puzzled. Are historical-critical methods in general flawed, or only when practiced by Germans?
?Only when practised by Germans, as any Italian would certainly answer :-)

(This refers to a running joke between some of us British, German and Italian philologists here at the Vienna department.)
I suppose the Adluri & Bagchee book deserves a more serious response, but I'm not interested personally.  How did this get by the commissioning editor at OUP NY?
Best,
