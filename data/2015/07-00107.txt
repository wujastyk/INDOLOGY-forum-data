Dear Dhaval Patel,
Thanks for sharing this.
I have a question: Is the test data different from the training?
I assume you have referred to the following two works:
   1. Statistical Constituency parser for Sanskrit compounds
   <http://sanskrit.uohyd.ernet.in/faculty/amba/PUBLICATIONS/samaasa_const_parser_icon2011.pdf>
   Amba Kulkarni and Anil Kumar, ICON 2011, Chennai Dec 18-19
   2. Clues from Astadhyayi for compound identification
   <http://sanskrit.uohyd.ernet.in/faculty/amba/PUBLICATIONS/scti-5scls.pdf>
   Amba Kulkarni and Anil Kumar, 5th international SCLS 2013, Mumbai
The first one reports the performance of the system, using only simple
probabilities.
The performance figures for 56 tags were as follows:
Rank      With 55 tags       With 8 tags
1                   63.0%               72.7%
2                   10.9%               13.2%
3                     7.2%                 9.5%
where Rank indicates the position of the correct solution among all
possible solutions.
The second one uses clues from the A.s.taadhyaayii to detect the compound
type of rare compounds, and the performance was 61%  times we got the first
guess correct, and if we allow 3 guesses, 81% one among the 3 guesses were
correct.
With regards,
Amba Kulkarni
