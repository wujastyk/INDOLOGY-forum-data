But nowhere is given a reference to an edition of the work.
However, I suspect that it was issued in some local/Kerala publishing house or journal. As it must have been the case of his poem Cakravartin?gu?ama?im?l? (in praise of Queen Victoria) and other original Sanskrit compositions. The NCC should be checked s.v.
At the least his manual of Indian culture entitled Bh?rat?nuvar?anam, prefaced (in English) by Sylvain L?vi (who was in epistolary contact with him and at the request of whom the work was written) was issued in 1905 (2nd and 3rd ed. Trivandrum : Sudharma Print House, 1925 and 1940; re-issued by V. Subrahmanyan, Hyderabad: Sanskrit Academy, 2010, Sanskrit Academy Series (ed. T. Keshava Narayana) no. 83).
