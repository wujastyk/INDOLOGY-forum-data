[INDOLOGY] Sources for verses on fate/karma
Since the search is still on for quotations of these verses, perhaps these ?aiva quotations may be of interest.
South Indian ?aiva authors from the twelfth century onwards (e.g. Aghora?iv?c?rya ad M?gendrav?ttid?pik? 8.5) tend to quote just these two p?das without attribution:
n?bhukta? k??yate karma kalpako?i?atair api
These 2 p?das became incorporated into the Pau?karasa?hit?, a ?aiva scripture apparently unknown in the twelfth century that has been commented upon in the sixteenth, as half-verse 2.45cd.
The tenth-century Kashmirian commentator Bha??a R?maka??ha frequently quotes (e.g. Kira?av?tti 5:9.2) the following quarter verse as being ?ruti/?gama, in other words as being from a scripture of the ?aivasiddh?nta:
n?bhukta? karma na?yati
I haven?t been able to trace it in a Siddh?ntatantra.
