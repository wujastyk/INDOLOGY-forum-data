Dear Antonia,
You will find links to some recordings here:

However these represent just a few samples ? there is a lot of variation by region, tradition, and individual.
Best wishes,

[INDOLOGY] tunes/melodies used for chanting Sanskrit verse
Dear all,
I've been looking for a source (online or printed) on the different tunes used to chant the various Sanskrit meters. Do any of you know whether something like that exists, or whether these are only passed on orally?
Many thanks,
     Antonia
