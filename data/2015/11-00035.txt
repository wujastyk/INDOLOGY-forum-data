[INDOLOGY] Database of manuscripts digitized by National	Manuscript Mission
Thank you so much for this very important database. You have done a great service. Now if we can only obtain actual manuscripts from NAMAMI we would be in a perfect world, like the Nepali manuscripts from the central archive. Thanks again.
