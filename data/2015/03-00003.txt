> Call for Papers
> Uberoi Seminar at Shawnee State University, OHIO, USA
> We are excited to announce the interdisciplinary conference, Indian Cultural Heritage in the Global Age, which will take place at The Shawnee State University, Portsmouth, Ohio, October 29-30, 2015. The conference brings together academic research on India, its religious and cultural history. India is home to a number of religions such as Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism, collectively referred to as the Dharma traditions. As India gains economic momemtum and enters the global arena, its cultural traditions and religious practices adopt to change, and reach countries outside of India. While Yoga, and Vegetarianism are ubiquitous with India, other aspects of Indian culture are not as well known. In a global world, it is more than ever necessary to understand India, its culture and religions.  Hence we seek papers on all aspects of Indian culture and religions. 
> Additionally, selected papers will be included in a collection of essays resulting from the conference.
> 
> Please send a 350-word abstract in PDF format and brief (one paragraph maximum) bio to uberoiseminar at shawnee.edu or lvemsani at shawnee.edu by May 29, 2015 (11:59pm). Notifications of acceptance will be sent by June  29, 2015 and the program will be announced by July 29, 2015.
