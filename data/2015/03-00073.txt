Indology List
I'm not a member of Indology List and therefore I know that I cannot post a
message for its members. However, I suppose that some of the members of
Indology List might be interested in this information about a new journal
published in Brazil:
?Cultura Oriental? publishes articles resulting from original research
relating to various cultural aspects of Asian Far East (especially India,
China, Japan and Tibet), including language, religion, literature,
philosophy, arts and other subjects, covering both the current culture and
its historical aspects. Its scope does not include, however, subjects such
as economy, trade and politics of the contemporary period.
?Cultura Oriental? is published by the Graduate Program in Religion
Sciences of Federal University of Para?ba (UFPB). The editors of ?Cultura
Oriental? are Fabricio Possebon (UFPB) and Roberto de Andrade Martins (USP,
UFSCar). This jornal is published in two versions: electronic (ISSN
2358-5021) and printed (ISSN 2358-503X):
