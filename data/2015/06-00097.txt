My, this has stirred up a hornet?s nest, hasn?t it?  If the book is so bad, why doesn?t someone do an impartial review and refute its major theses?  Obviously, the book will be considered important by many, a successor to Said?s work (see the blurb on Amazon from Hiltebeitel?s review). I don?t find any of the negative replies on Indology so far substantive ? they are, rather, general impressions or unflattering stories about the authors which, even if true, do not directly concern their book.  Why is it so bad? I certainly agree it is unconscionable to associate anyone with ?Nazi ideology? unless they have publicly defended the Nazis or, like Heidegger, actually joined the Nazi party. This is my last post on the subject. GH

He added it as a "supplement" to a paper dealing with the matter by his successor J?rgen Hanneder, which I have attached to this mail for your kind information (pp. 136f).
