[INDOLOGY] New Issues of E-Journal of Vedic Studies
Dear Michael,
Firstly happy new year to everyone.  Secondly when I try to access the
http://ejvs.laurasianacademy.com link to view the Fritz Staal article I get
a "You don't have permission to access / on this server." message and
unable to view the article.
Thanks,
Harry Spier
