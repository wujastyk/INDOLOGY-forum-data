[INDOLOGY] deciphering a Tibetan mural
Dear Mark,
I don't think there's anything "pseudo-" about this inscription. It 
looks like script forms seen in old Sanskrit mss. from Nepal, and also 
resembles Pala-period scripts. A specialist in those areas (which I am 
not) should be able to confirm this and read it. (The last word is 
probably svaahaa.)
