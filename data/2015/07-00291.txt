=?utf-8?Q?[INDOLOGY]_Digital_Edition_of_Laghusiddh=C4=81ntakaumud=C4=AB_(James_R_Ballantyne_Translation)?=
Dear All,
I am looking for a digital version (not a photo scan but a keyed in or
edited OCR-ed version) of Laghusiddh?ntakaumud? (James R Ballantyne
Translation or any other if not the Ballantyne edition).
If anyone knows of any such edition or something similar I would most
appreciate.
Kindest Wishes,
Martin
