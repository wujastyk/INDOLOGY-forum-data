Dear List,
The p?das: yad ida? vedavacana? kuru karma tyajeti ca /  occur with minor variations four times in the Mah?bh?rata.
Can anybody guide me to a Vedic text that says kuru karma tyaja or something like it? I have had a quick look at a few texts, but come up with nothing.
Thanks in advance.
Cheers,
Greg Bailey
