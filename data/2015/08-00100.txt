Thanks, all, for your comments.

Christophe ? I think Fenicio mentions the term Veda only in relation to a
Vedic mantra recited while consuming panchagavya (I think - I have only my
notes on Charpentier's edition (does anyone have a pdf?), which in any case
according to Paolo Aranha omits a large part of the original ms). But Ludo
Rocher argues (*Puranas*, 1986: 11) that Fenicio's primary sources were
puranic, and that this is even made explicit in the title of a Latin
translation of Fenicio: *Collectio omnium dogmatum & arcanorum ex Puranis
seu libris Canonicis paganorum Indianorum*...

Part of my argument in the article I'm preparing is that despite many
references to the Vedas as the most authoritative Indian sacred texts,
other texts were almost invariably the actual source. Azevedo, for
instance, having mentioned the Vedas as the original texts then goes on to
cite exclusively Tamil sources (*Tirumantiram*, *Tiruv?cakam*, *Tiv?karam*,
*Tirukku?a?* and another Tamil text on caste).

Thanks also for the references to the texts acquired by the Jesuits (stolen
on their behalf by a convert, it appears) in the 1550s. On the basis of
fragments of translations of these done by the convert (a Brahmin baptised
as Manuel Olivera) which were sent to Europe and are extant in Portugal and
Goa, Ines Zupanov and Angela Barreto Xavier have identified these as
J??ne?vara?s Marathi version of Bhagavad-G?t?, a purana by N?mdev, and
parts of the Mah?bh?rata.  Also in Portugal are three manuscripts
containing parts of the Mah?bh?rata and R?may??a in Konkani prose and
Marathi verse, transliterated into Roman script by Jesuits around the same
period. I think there is likely some connection here, but I'm not aware of
anyone who's explored it.

Best wishes

Will
