[INDOLOGY] SanskritAccent - an accent generator
Dear all,
We are happy to present before you our project SanskritAccent - a
computational simulation of ?????????s.
*Expected outcome* -
1. The code converts an unaccented word into accented version with help of
?????????s.
e.g. ????? -> ??????.
2. The code also shows the ????????? responsible for the accent (in this
case ????????? ???????????? ).
*Source code* - https://github.com/drdhaval2785/SanskritAccent/
*Online testing* -
http://www.sanskritworld.in/sanskrittool/SanskritAccent/accent.html
*N.B.* -
1. Currently we have considered only ?????????s. ?????????, ????????? and
???????????? are not incorporated as of yet.
2. Bug reports are welcome at
https://github.com/drdhaval2785/SanskritAccent/issues.
3. We have relied on three books - (1) zAntanava's phiTsUtras by F.
Kielhorn (2) svarasiddhAntacandrikA of zrInivAsayajvan and (3)
siddhAntakaumudI with subodhinI commentary.
4. Current version is version 1.0.1 (
https://github.com/drdhaval2785/SanskritAccent/releases/tag/v1.0.1)
