[INDOLOGY] Tamil currency symbol
Dear Colleagues,
In one of the Tamil manuscripts I am working on, I have found the mention
of a price.
This currency is expressed by a symbol (see attached images).
I guess this symbol means "rupee", but I am not sure.
Has any of you ever seen such a symbol?
Or could direct me towards any source illustrating currency symbols used in
Tamil and/or Indian manuscripts/inscriptions?
With many thanks in advance.
