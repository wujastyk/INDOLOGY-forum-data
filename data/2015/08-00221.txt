[INDOLOGY] training in poetic composition in traditional	Sanskrit education?
Till the sixties it was expected of undergraduate and post-graduate
students of Calcutta to write their answers in Sanskrit at the examination.
This started at the higher secondary level in the explanation of Sanskrit
verses. Some took to English but writing in one?s mother tongue did not
create good impression.
In the Departmental magazines of the undergraduate classes Sanskrit
compositions were encouraged under the supervision of a teacher towards the
development of skill. Philological deliberation was not encouraged. Poems
or articles singing to the glory of Sanskrit, apart from secular poetic
compositions, were welcomed. An article by me was revised by Pandit Sitaram
Shastri (Mithila) as it did not contain sufficient ?m?h?tmyak?rtana? of
Sanskrit. I made additions that made it acceptable.
Writing answers in Sanskrit had been the convention but was not compulsory.
It was supposed to be a mark of distinction and it paid by way of
relatively favorable assessment.  The emphasis was greater in the
post-graduate classes. Later, under vigorous political emphasis on the
mother tongue, it became the practice to write answers in one?s mother
tongue. The earlier enterprise petered out.
Sorry for a long lecture. I request forgiveness.
