Dear Colleagues,
I would like to ask if perhaps anybody knows something
more about Govindan?tha from Kerala, the author of
?a?kara's hagiography - *?a?kar?c?ryacarita *also called
*Keral?ya-?a?karavijaya *(dated for ca. 17th century, although this dating is
rather doubtful)?
I would be really grateful for any information,
Olga Nowicka
