Hello
Dear Sir
This is an idol of Goddess Parvati. The pottery with sprouted Barley is offered to this deity when Gaurivrat is observed in Gujarat. The unmarried girls observed this Vrat for five days, in which they strictly observed fast and do not take salt and eat only milk, fruit and wheat. This is observed with faith to achieve good husband like Lord Siva. The sprouted Barley is sign of fertility.
