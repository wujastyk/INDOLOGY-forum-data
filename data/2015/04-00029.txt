[INDOLOGY] Tukaram and the name Tuka
This is just a long shot, but could "Tuka" be somehow connected to 
"Turus.ka," which is variously used in Sanskrit to refer to Central 
Asians ("Turks," "Tocharians") or (later) to Muslims in general? At 
least it's in the right general geographical zone ("Tajika").
