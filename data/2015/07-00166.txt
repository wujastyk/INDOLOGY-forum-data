We should recall that even history?s greatest villains have been the object of extensive, even dispassionate, historical study. To give one grotesque example, scholars widely link Hitler?s rise to power to economic and social conditions in Germany after WW I. This does not entail a theory of socio-historical determinism that would entirely exonerate Hitler?s supporters, but it was a crucial factor, and it did directly inspire the Marshall Plan after WW 2.
