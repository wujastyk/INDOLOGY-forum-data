[INDOLOGY] Project management software?
Several people mentioned Asana <https://asana.com/>, and it does look
good.  It seems to be free for use by a team of up to 15 people, which
would cover almost all academic workers, certainly in humanities subjects.
The interface is pleasant and fairly self-explanatory.  Asana isn't Open
Source, and one can't install the software on one's own server; one has to
use it on their website.
