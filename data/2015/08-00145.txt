[INDOLOGY] Vedic/Sutra affiliation
Dear Prof. Deshpande,
What I observed with the few Br?hma?as of Maharashtra that learned more
than one Veda is that they usually affiliate to the first Veda they learned
as their sva??kh? (which should be the Veda of their family, thus
determined by birth, although this is often not the case). The additional
Vedas learned after their own Veda (usually portions thereof or the Sa?hit?
of the next Veda at the most) are usually considered secondary. In some
cases the second Veda learned is more important for their ritual
activities. For example I witnessed that some Yajurvedins had learned the
S?maveda and thus were known and hired often for their expertise in
chanting the second Veda (as there are fewer S?mavedins in Maharashtra),
yet still considered Taittir?ya their sva??kh? and ?pastambha or
Hira?yake?? their S?tra.
I hope this anecdotal information helps. If I remember correctly Scharfe in
his Education in Ancient India (2002) collected some of the textual
references on the rules of first learning one's sva??kh? and then
proceeding to the next Veda, but unfortunately, I do not have the book at
hand right now.
Best,
