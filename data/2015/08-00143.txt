[INDOLOGY] Vedic/Sutra affiliation
Dear Colleagues,
I dont know the answer (but like very much to learn it), but one fact is that at least in some parts of India ?gveda is considered more prestigious than others. I have met Brahmans in South India, who proudly announce to belong to Rigveda, but when asked about their Shakha, admit to belong to Apastamba.
Best,
Klaus
