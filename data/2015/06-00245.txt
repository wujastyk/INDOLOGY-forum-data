That J?taka is an odd one, because, while the prose portion refers to a jackal, the verse portion (and the title) refer to a cat.The Bodhisatta is a mouse as big as a boar, who bites the throat of the scheming cat/jackal and kills it. Although it would be improbable for a mouse to kill a cat, a rat could certainly do it a lot of damage, and it takes quite a big or bold cat to take on a rat (though archaeological remains from elsewhere suggest that at this period the domestic cat (Felis catus) was still bigger on average than it is today.) The verse part of the J?taka may reflect a period when the black rat (Rattus rattus) and (not coincidentally) the domestic cat had arrived in India on ships. (Merchant seafaring is quite a frequent theme in the J?takas, perhaps reflecting the circles in which these stories arose.) In the prose portion of the J?taka, which may be later, the cat has been replaced by another animal regarded as a schemer, and one more familiar in Indian fable.
Strangely, none of the story books I have seen that retell J?taka tales for children seems to include a picture of the Bodhisatta as a giant rat biting the throat of a pussycat.
