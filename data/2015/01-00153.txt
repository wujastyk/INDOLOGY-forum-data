[INDOLOGY] Vedic verse in Ortega y Gasset
Dear Elizabeth and Dipak,
Yes, the /s?vitr? /is what has been suggested privately by others too, 
and indeed is what I had thought of in the first place, but given the 
vaguenes of the resemblance I wanted to check if some Vedicists could 
come up with something more appropriate. But after all, it may well be 
the case that the /s?vitr?/ picked up from nth-hand literature is at the 
bottom of it (especially, as Elizabeth notes and Dipak elaborates upon, 
on account of its connection with the morning prayer).
With best wishes,
Paolo
