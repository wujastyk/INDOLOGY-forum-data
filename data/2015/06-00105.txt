Dear Hans,

In his recent post to Indology, Prof. Pandurangi refers to three Western
Indologists.  One is referred to as 'Prof. Jesse.' Another is referred to
as 'Dr Wendy Doniger.'  And a third is referred to as 'Howard Resnick.'
Then in passing he refers to three other Indologists as 'reputed scholars
like Cardona, Aklujkar and Deshpande, etc.'  Can you explain to me the
complex sociological hierarchy of this system of reference?  Do you think
that there is no hierarchy here?  Do you really think that in this context
"Prof. Jesse" is respectful?
