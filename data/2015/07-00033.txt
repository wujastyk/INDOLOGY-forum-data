Might I gently suggest that words like ?tribal? and ?tribal cults? should be avoided. Like ?untouchable? and the n-word, these words have long been used to marginalize, demean, and patronize various ethnic groups?and they are so nebulous that they have no real meaning (for me, at least). ?Indigenous? might be a good substitute. Words like ?tribal? and ?tribal cult? in my opinion serve to obscure the fact that the groups they are applied to are comprised of human beings whose cultures are quite as complex and sophisticated as the Brahmanical culture to which they are contrasted.

I am also bothered by the use of the term ?Sanskritization,? It is, in my opinion, a simplification of a very complex series of processes and interactions and is, in the end, quite misleading. In most areas, India has a cellular culture. Many different groups with varied identities, histories, practices, social views, etc. exist side by side, interacting with each other in complex ways. People may get status by eating more meat, less meat, or no meat at all, and the same goes for many other practices, beliefs and customs. It is perhaps useful to point out that in a place like Tamil Nadu, about 25% of the people are Dalits (3% are Brahmins). They have their own social hierarchies, no doubt, but they are not driven by ?Sanskritization.? Nor, for the most part, are the great majority of the rest of the people, all of whom are considered ?Sudras? by the Brahmins. George Hart

Motivated, as you have noticed, by the political need to communicate on one hand with the local population, on the other - with the broader network of sub-continental cult/pilgrimage centers.
