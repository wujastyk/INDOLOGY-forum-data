Traditionally, texts of the NS type are divided into udde?a (section), lak?a?a (section) and par?k?? (section). Unless V?caspati-mi?ra and ??likan?tha have actually quoted phrases or sentences not found in the lak?a?a and par?k?? sections of the commentandum, there would be no reason to assume that they are going beyond the thought-world of the commentandum (actual in V?caspati-mi?ra?s case, contextually presupposed in ??likan?tha?s case).
It is unlikely to be a coincidence that two of the three terms I have mentioned above are found in the terms under discussion. 
Bhart?-hari?s presumably lost work or work-part is known as -samudde?a, not as -parvan.
