Dear Elliot,

> I need some help in understanding Walter?s mah?bh?rata reference.
I am travelling without access to the Crit. Ed. (full text with apparatus).
I cited the nAbhuktaM passage from my article quoted and am pretty sure I
had located it in the apparatus of passages not accepted as critical by the
editors, numbered as MahAbhArata "13, App. 15, 2200 A 1 pr."
I am afraid it will require to consult the printed edition to (re)trace the
actual wording.

Best, Walter
