Another area to think about is the "Tantra-yukti" lists that occur in the
Artha??stra, Carakasa?hit? and Su?rutasa?hit?.  There's a good account of
them in Antonella Comba's *La medicina indiana classica*
<http://www.lulu.com/shop/antonella-serena-comba/la-medicina-indiana-classica-%C4%81yurveda/paperback/product-18654023.html>
and in Dasgupta's *History of Indian Philosophy*
<https://archive.org/details/AHistoryOfIndianPhilosophyBySurendranathDasgupta-5Volumes>
v.2 ch.13.  These are like general paribh???s that appear to be very old
and were applied in several ??stras, including especially ny?ya.
