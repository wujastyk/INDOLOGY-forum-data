[INDOLOGY] Examples of very ambiguous devanagari Sanskrit	sentences
Even before going to sentences, words are ambiguous (homophony) because distinct morphological constructions yield different meanings, even before compounding.
Kunjunni Raja (Indian Theories of Meaning p37) discusses sam?na:
sam?na1 = sam-?na :  digestion
s'am?na2 = taddhita derivative of sama : similar, same
sam?na3 = sa-maana : of the same measure; honored; proud
and actually in this last case, one should distinguish sam?na3 = sa-maana1 :  honored; proud
from sam?na4 = sa-maana2 : of the same measure
since maana itself is more than polysemic, it has 2 distinct homophones:
maana1 : esteemed; proud ; esteem, pride (pp of root man = to think)
maana2 = k?t derivative of root maa : measure, dimension
It is to be noted that MW's homonymy treatment of this situation is rather confusing.
Thus, even a simple inflected form such as sam?nam may have (at least) four different meanings, just by internal morphology ambiguity.
