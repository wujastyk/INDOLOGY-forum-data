Even before going to sentences, words are ambiguous (homophony) because distinct morphological constructions yield different meanings, even before compounding.

Kunjunni Raja (Indian Theories of Meaning p37) discusses sam?na:
sam?na1 = sam-?na :  digestion
s'am?na2 = taddhita derivative of sama : similar, same
sam?na3 = sa-maana : of the same measure; honored; proud

and actually in this last case, one should distinguish sam?na3 = sa-maana1 :  honored; proud
from sam?na4 = sa-maana2 : of the same measure
since maana itself is more than polysemic, it has 2 distinct homophones:
maana1 : esteemed; proud ; esteem, pride (pp of root man = to think)
maana2 = k?t derivative of root maa : measure, dimension

It is to be noted that MW's homonymy treatment of this situation is rather confusing.

Thus, even a simple inflected form such as sam?nam may have (at least) four different meanings, just by internal morphology ambiguity.
