[INDOLOGY] Vedic verse in Ortega y Gasset
It seems to me that the relative in the third line must make this one sentence, but I am not a Vedicist.  More interesting would be to know why the G?yatr? became so important and omnipresent.  (One might also remark that it is emended to refer to Ganesha and other deities in almost every puja).  It?s rather nice, but there are many other Vedic verses that are just as nice.  What set this apart?  And why?  George
