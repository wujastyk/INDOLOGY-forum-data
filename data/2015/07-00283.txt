Post-Scriptum

In terms of frequency,
I would venture to say that the most serious exception to the massive 
presence of etukai at the beginning of lines in the Tamil devotional 
corpus is seen in the n?ricai ve?p? (which differs in that manner from 
the i??icai ve?p?).

See for instance the /mutal tiruvant?ti/ (by poykaiy??v?r), the /ira???m 
tiruvant?ti/, etc.

For a graphic representation of the pattern, see the attached PNG image,
taken from page 57 in a recent article of mine.

Chevillard, Jean-Luc, 2014, Metres in Tamil Bhakti Literature and the 
Problem of their (occasional) Description in Treatises (Studies in Tamil 
Metrics-2), pp.39-96, in Gillet, Val?rie (Ed.), Mapping the Chronology 
of Bhakti: Milestones, Stepping Stones, and Stumbling Stones. 
Proceedings of a Workshop Held in Honour of Pandit R. Varadadesikan, 
Collection Indologie n? 124, Institut Fran?ais de Pondich?ry / Ecole 
fran?aise d?Extr?me-Orient.

Regarding the two types of ve?p?,
there is an interesting article by V.S. Rajam

Rajam, V.S., 1992, ?The Evolution of Ve?p? as an Independent Entity?, 
pp. 163-184 in PILC Jourrnal of Dravidic Studies, Pondicherry Institute 
of Linguistics and Culture, Volume 2:2, Pondicherry.

It might be available online somewhere, but I do not have the URL at hand.
