[INDOLOGY] Does anyone know of Sanskrit works that use 2nd-syllable rhyming?
Post-Scriptum
In terms of frequency,
I would venture to say that the most serious exception to the massive 
presence of etukai at the beginning of lines in the Tamil devotional 
corpus is seen in the n?ricai ve?p? (which differs in that manner from 
the i??icai ve?p?).
See for instance the /mutal tiruvant?ti/ (by poykaiy??v?r), the /ira???m 
tiruvant?ti/, etc.
For a graphic representation of the pattern, see the attached PNG image,
taken from page 57 in a recent article of mine.

Regarding the two types of ve?p?,
there is an interesting article by V.S. Rajam
Rajam, V.S., 1992, ?The Evolution of Ve?p? as an Independent Entity?, 
pp. 163-184 in PILC Jourrnal of Dravidic Studies, Pondicherry Institute 
of Linguistics and Culture, Volume 2:2, Pondicherry.
It might be available online somewhere, but I do not have the URL at hand.
