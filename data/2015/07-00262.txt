they're? Indian.  Why would they?

I hope it is not intended to communicate that  'Indian cultural historians
spend all their time drumming up hatred for American scholars of Indian
history and culture', or circularly 'those who spend all their time
drumming up hatred for American scholars of Indian history and culture are
called Indian cultural historians'.

Just as American scholars of Indian history and culture are called American
Indologists, I think ?Indian? scholars of American history and culture can
be called Indian Americologists. Is there a field called 'Americology'? Are
there Indian Americologists?

Since I do not know if the word Indian Americologists exists or not, let me
use the word ?Indian? scholars of American history and culture only. May I
know how many of these are there? How big or small is their group? Is their
influence on the American education on America comparable in proportion to
the influence of western Indologists on Indian education of India?

Is the size of the group of Egyptian Americologists anywhere close to the
size of group of American and/or European Egyptologists?

Thought these questions may help understand some Indian perspectives about
certain portions of western Indology that create inconveniences/problems to
different sections and/or aspects of Indian society, empathetically.
