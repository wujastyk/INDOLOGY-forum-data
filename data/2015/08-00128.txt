[INDOLOGY] New Book: The ?tman-Brahman in Ancient Buddhism
A corrected reprint of this book with a new introduction has now been
issued. A number of typographical errors were corrected, mostly in the
extensive notes. Anyone who purchased the first release may contact me
off-list for a replacement.
As a result of feedback after the first release, I felt it necessary to add
a new introduction. This was written by myself. It has been posted
separately at Academia.edu:
