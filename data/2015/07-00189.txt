Subject: [INDOLOGY] The legal right to publish OA

In Holland and Germany, it seems, academics have the legal right to
reproduce their own writings in an Open Access form after a "reasonable
time" (Holland) or "12 months" (Germany).  That is, if the writings are
funded - even partly - by public money.
