[INDOLOGY] query [regarding the correct version of a	defectively cited verse]
Two highly probable emendations for the defective verse have already been suggested. Suggesting a third one, ???? for ??????, I would like to translate the verse as follows: ?As long as Indra is the lord of heaven, as long as the Moon casts light (and) as long as the story of R?ma exists in the world, may you remain in existence (or stay in power)!  ??????????? ???? ???? ???????????: ???????: ? ??????????? ???? ?????? ????? ?????????? ??
?.?.
