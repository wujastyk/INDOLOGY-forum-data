Valerie: aren't black-naped hares (*Lepus nigricollis*), also known as
Indian hares, native to India? As you may know, Dravidian languages have a
non-IA word for rabbit/hare: **mucal*/*muyal (*Telugu *kund?lu *is an
interesting exception)*.* Are there any other non-IE words for hare in
other Indian languages? I think the words *kharabhaka/ kharago**?**  (*?????)
'donkey's ears'  are of recent origin, and perhaps have a Persian
connection.
Elliot: You are right about the language in the video. It is indeed Telugu
Americanized English. They must be one of the Telugu-American immigrant
families.
Walter:  I heard *mah?nasa-?a?a-ny?ya* (rabbit in the kitchen -- easy to
catch) and *?a?a-vi???a-ny?ya* (a hare's horn -- a term for an
impossibility), but not the one you mentioned. I know *?a?i as moon * (in
compound form for*?a?in *is moon), but not as a feminine form of *?a?a. *Does
any other Indian language show an equivalent of *?a??-sarpa-ny?ya?*
