=?utf-8?Q?Re:_[INDOLOGY]_Mattavil=C4=81sa_Prahasana?=
Dear Colleagues,
just as a curiosity: Among Mattavil?sa translations, there is also one in Finnish, in my collection Huumori muinaisessa Intiassa ( The Sense of Humour in Ancient India. Helsinki 2000), which also contains Bhagavadajjuk?ya and Ubhay?bhis?rik?. The text I used was that of Lockwood & Bhat.
Best,
Klaus
