Dear Al,

Thank you for your input. Good, cool evaluation of the situation.

Rajiv Malhotra is not an indologist, sensu stricto. He -  is  -  somewhere
there; he acts, he writes out of his own, self-created space. And he is
going to stay there. And his many supporters are not going to simply
disappear.

Do we need to talk to them, as persons? Not necessarily. But we need to
address at least some of the doubts (re models of Indology) raised by them.

My reference point? Untouchability.

Best,

 Artur Karp
