Subject: [INDOLOGY] Second-syllable rhyming in Dravidian

It was remarked a while ago that interline SSR appears to be a proto-south-Dravidian feature. Since Telugu is a central Dravidian language (though some dispute that), it may be that interline SSR was not a part of its inheritance. Perhaps intraline SSR goes back to an earlier time than protoSDR, as it is found in South Dravidian languages as well as Telugu. George Hart

The rule of line-break is based on feet count unlike the syllable count in Sanskrit meters. Since it is part of rule, naturally there are massive number of examples in Telugu for intra-line SSR , spread all over the Telugu verse literature employing native Telugu meters.

That becoming a strict rule for Sanskrit borrowed Telugu  verse meters could be specific to Telugu prosody.
