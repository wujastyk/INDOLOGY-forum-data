[INDOLOGY] Second-syllable rhyming in Dravidian
It was remarked a while ago that interline SSR appears to be a proto-south-Dravidian feature. Since Telugu is a central Dravidian language (though some dispute that), it may be that interline SSR was not a part of its inheritance. Perhaps intraline SSR goes back to an earlier time than protoSDR, as it is found in South Dravidian languages as well as Telugu. George Hart
