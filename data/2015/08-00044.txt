[INDOLOGY] Job at University of Wisconsin
What?s the deadline for sending in the application? 
Should the letters of recommendation be sent separately or together with the application?
Way back when I was applying for jobs, the letters of recommendation were to be sealed and sent along with the application. I?d like to know about the current protocol, so I can guide some youngsters accordingly.
Thanks and regards,
rajam
