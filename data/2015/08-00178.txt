[INDOLOGY] Help on mystery painting of Ramayana (?) episode
1. Through skin colour, the artist is showing the shooting person to be
Lakshmana and one of the onlookers in dark complexion as Rama.
2. The female character can be Sita.
3. This could be a version of Trijata's dream, an episode narrated in
Ranganatha Ramayana in Telugu. But the details of dream in Ranganatha
Ramayana do not have the reverse shot by Lakshmana. Nevertheless it has
Sita being an onlooker to the attack on Ravana by Rama's team.
