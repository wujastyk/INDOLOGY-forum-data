[INDOLOGY] Articles by J. N. Banerjea
Dear colleagues,
I'm looking to get hold of two articles by J.N. Banerjea, both published in
the *Journal of the Indian Society of Oriental Art* (JISOA), namely:
'The Holy Pa?cav?ras of the V???is', in JISOA 10 (1942): 65-68.
and
'Images of S?mba', in JISOA 11 (1944): 129-134.
If any members of the list should have electronic copies of either of these
and are willing to share them, I'd be very grateful indeed.
Many thanks in advance,
Robert
