[INDOLOGY] archery question
Worth mentioning in passing might be episodes from the Buddha legend, especially from the Lalitavistara, where the bodhisattva is depicted as defeating all his young ??kya colleagues. Sculptural representations of the (series of) episode(s), especially in Gandh?ran art, are numerous. A good starting point is certainly Isao Kurita, Gandh?ran Art, I, The Buddha's Life Story, especially pp. 54-55; other reproductions can be found in W. Zwalf, A Catalogue of Gandh?ra Sculpture in the British Museum, vol. II,  unfortunately unavailable to me right now.
Nobody knows what another might find in textual or iconographic sources, so why not give it a try...
