[INDOLOGY] "Pots don't speak", nor do they vote
I disagree. A project can be as racist as a person.  I agree however that
the battle should be fought on scholarly grounds, yet it is important to
maintain a critical awareness that scholarship is not neutral and always
maintains political implications. This should be obvious today from the
work of (whatever their limitations) Edward Said, Pierre Bourdieu, etc.,
who conducted thoroughgoing critiques of the notion of neutrality and
disinterestedness in scholarship. To identify a thought process or
intellectual project as racist does not necessarily imply that it should be
censored.  Again it is best combatted on the scholarly-intellectual ground
where it is launched. Rather it is about cultivating a critical awareness
and perspective, with which empirical research can become less meaningful.
