[INDOLOGY] Remembering the episodes which led to the creation ofY-Indology
O, Pardon me, Dear JLC.
A very happy 2015!
The paper under consideration sounded fascinating to me. I hadn't seen it before. So, I sincerely wanted to understand the etymology of the Sanskrit term "makara" through professional Sanskritists. Sorry for having mentioned your name in my posting. 
OK, my interest has disappeared now!
Sincerely,
