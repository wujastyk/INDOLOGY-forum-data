Subject: [INDOLOGY] Diacritical Sanskrit Problem in OS Yosemite
Message-ID: <CAJz4T_5-0erm9vMT9fbBedHTtY1TyeP_2yY0Z+MNz9ufQc8pag@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Friends,

Just yesterday I had to reformat my Mac and I discovered that I have
shifted from OS Maverick to OS Yosemite. While on Maverick I was using a
Unicode keyboard option (on the right corner up there) that I had manually
put in the Fonts folder (inside the System folder), however this does not
seem to work with Yosemite. I do not want to use US International PC option
for writing diacritics. Is there some better, easy and straightforward
method to solve this problem? I would appreciate any help.

Best wishes.

Mrinal Kaul
