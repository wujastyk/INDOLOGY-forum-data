[INDOLOGY] Diacritical Sanskrit Problem in OS Yosemite
Dear Friends,
Just yesterday I had to reformat my Mac and I discovered that I have
shifted from OS Maverick to OS Yosemite. While on Maverick I was using a
Unicode keyboard option (on the right corner up there) that I had manually
put in the Fonts folder (inside the System folder), however this does not
seem to work with Yosemite. I do not want to use US International PC option
for writing diacritics. Is there some better, easy and straightforward
method to solve this problem? I would appreciate any help.
Best wishes.
