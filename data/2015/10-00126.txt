[INDOLOGY] Fwd: Re:  copper plate
Here is some authoritative information about the copper plate 
(reportedly) from Peshawar, provided by Professor Dr Norbert Nebes of 
the University of Jena, forwarded by M. Macdonald of Oxford:
"As far as I am aware  the fragment of the bronze plaque is unknown and 
has not been published yet. It comes from the sanctuary  QDMN of Ta'lab 
Riyam  which is  situated in Damhan, the ancient name of the present day 
al-Huqqa in the northern highlands of Yemen (about 20 km in the north of 
Sanaa).  Without any doubt,  it is a votive text probably dedicated by a 
female person. The text (Middle Sabaic, from the early centuries AD) 
also contains two or three interesting words."
[Prof. Nebes wishes it to be noted that "the information is not intended 
for the art market resp. for persons who are involved in this metier (in 
any way)."]
So my previous guess about the dating was way off -- please disregard 
it. The correct date proposed by Prof. Nebes, i.e. "the early centuries 
AD," makes a little more sense, in that this is the period when Peshawar 
(ancient Purusapura) was something of a metropolis. But it is still very 
surprising that this object from such a remote location should be found 
there. Of course it is possible that it was brought to Pakistan in 
modern times, but this seems hardly likely. If this really is what it 
seems, it might be somehow be a by-product of the widespread 
international sea and land trade between India and the west in the 
period concerned.
