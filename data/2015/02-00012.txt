[INDOLOGY] Call for book submissions on Indian medicine
The book series *Indian Medical Tradition*, published by Motilal
Banarsidass, produces important contemporary scholarship on South Asian
Medicine.  The editors are myself (U. Vienna) and Prof. K. G. Zysk (U.
Copenhagen).  The series includes original monographs, such as Das's *The
Origin of the Life of a Human Being*, and reprints of classic works such as
Zimmermann's *The Jungle and the Aroma of Meats* and Zysk's *Asceticism and
Healing: Medicine in the Buddhist Monastery*.  Eleven volumes have appeared
in the series thus far.  The books are published in Delhi and distributed
worldwide.  Authors receive royalties and hardback and paperback editions
are produced, according to sales demand.
Authors with book suggestions that might fit the series are invited to
submit their proposals to Prof. Zysk or myself, or the Motilal Banarsidass
office in Delhi.
Sincerely,
Dominik Wujastyk
