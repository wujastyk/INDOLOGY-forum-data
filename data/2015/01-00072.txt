[INDOLOGY] Translation
Van Buitenen translates the first pada of Maha-bharata CE 3.5.19 as ?You have never, Vidura, told me wrong;?
The Sanskrit: sa mA jihmaM vidura sarvaM bravISi
In terms of context (Dhrtarastra is rejecting Vidura?s counsel as false) and grammar, this seems to mean something like: "You, Vidura, speak all deceit/falsehood to me."
Am I missing something?
Thanks for your help!
