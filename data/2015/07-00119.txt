[INDOLOGY] regarding Malhotra's plaguerism
With regard to his own lack of quotation marks, Malhotra argues somewhere
[on RISA?] that the early Sanskritists also did not have quotation marks
either.  But in fact they did have quotations marks.  They used the
quotative particle iti going all the way back to the
Rigveda.
Malhotra's remarks are either profoundly ignorant or profoundly
disingenuous.
