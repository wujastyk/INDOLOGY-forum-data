[INDOLOGY] Honor code (Was Re: Raji Malhotra, plagiarism,	and the Saraswati)
My university, like many, has a rather well-developed set of guidelines
about academic integrity
<http://guides.library.ualberta.ca/content.php?pid=560222&sid=4617994>.
There are separate sections aimed at faculty and at students. The student
page "avoiding plagiarism
<http://guides.library.ualberta.ca/content.php?pid=560222&sid=4618015>"
contains useful guidelines that might have helped Malhotra when he was
writing. There is a video guide about what is and what is not acceptable
copying <https://youtu.be/8Bx5DAqTPhU>.  Humour is a personal thing, but I
found it very funny.
For the rappers among us, "cite your sources like a freaking adult
<https://youtu.be/bT6S4ERI0o8>."
