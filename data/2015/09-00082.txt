Dear all,

You may have heard of the encouraging news that the University of T?bingen is inaugurating the so-called "Gundert Chair?: Under this agreement lecturers and professors from the Thunchath Ezhuthachan Malayalam University will regularly teach Malayalam at T?bingen University. The first Visiting Professor is Scaria Zacharia, he will come for October and November. Besides teaching of and research on the Malayalam language  the Malayalam University is particularly interested to make literary works known and accessible by professional translations to the German audience. Furthermore, the traditional cultural (art) forms of Kerala will be supported.

The official opening of the "Gundert Chair" will be held on 9 October 2015. On Saturday and Sunday a symposium follows with topics such as "Malayalam language and literature in Germany / Europe", "Malayali migrants and their lives in Germany", the Gundert legacy will be exposed in the University Library and an excursion to Calw is planned. Further we organized a colorful cultural program - the complete schedule is attached as a flyer. We would like to warmly invite you to participate in the opening ceremony and the subsequent weekend seminar (9 to 11October 2015)!
