For those interested in an attempt to evaluate A:L. de Ch?zy in his own
context of "Oriental Renaissance" (irrespective of whether or not we at
present feel inspired by this short lived European enthousiasm for India) I
have attached an abstract of my presentation at the Ch?zy colloque.
It's in French, and to facilitate cross-linguistic and cross-cultural
communication: the samgraha is in Sanskrit. I do not know whether the list
will accept and redistribute this attachment but in due course I will also
upload it on my academia.edu page.
