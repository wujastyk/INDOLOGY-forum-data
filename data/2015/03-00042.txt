Subject: [INDOLOGY] Impact factors, citation metrics, etc.
Message-ID: <CAKdt-CdsEYthUMEPP-DnKJ5Cs8u_62eTySh7TE8M3ybgtOhkKA@mail.gmail.com>

"AltMetrics [and impact factors] are numbers generated by people who don't
understand research, for people who don't understand research.

People who read papers and understand research just don't need them and
should shun them."
