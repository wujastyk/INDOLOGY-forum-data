In Classical Tamil texts we come across 'ko??i maka?ir' in two instances. In the Maturaikk??ci (MK), following Nacci??rkki?iyar, the commentator, it is usually interpreted as courtesans who 'capture' the wealth from their clients.  In the Pa??i?app??ai (PP), it is interpreted as referring to women captured from the defeated ruler's household after a war.  In my examination of the usage of the word 'ko??i', it seems to connote the meaning of 'possession/property/wealth'. As a result, I do not think 'ko??i maka?ir' in PP referred to captive women at all. 'k???i maka?ir' literally meant 'women of possession'. Essentially it was the equivalent of 'ladies' or 'women of high status'. In other words, it seems to be synonymous with the later usages of 'na?kai' or ???i' or ??vi'/'??vi' or '??v?r'/'??v?r' or 'c??i'/'c??i' < 'sv?mini'. During later times 'ko??i' was used as part of the names of both men and women just as '???i' or '??v?r/'??v?r' was. 


I would appreciate any comments.


Thanks
