[INDOLOGY] Fun media piece about the Mitanni: Sanskrit in	Ancient Syria
Just a quick note ? 
We have references in ca?kam literature about training elephants but not about horses.
puravi (?????), kutirai (??????), m? (??), kalim? (?????) are the terms used in ca?kam literature to refer to an animal that we now understand as a ?horse.?
?ti (???), pari (???), na?ai (???), vicai (????), k?l iyal (???? ????) are the descriptors that I find with reference to the movement of a horse.
More references would enlighten me.
Thanks and regards,
rajam
