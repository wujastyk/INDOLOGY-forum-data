Dear Jo,

There is an interesting Dharma??stra use of paribh??? in connection with the viv?dapada called sa?vidvyatikrama.  Several commentaries call the conventions of various local groups p?ribh??ikadharma and speak of settling complicated legal matters by resorting to this kind of dharma.  I understand these to be local rules that fix the manner in which rules of ??stra will be applied or received in particular groups, and thence paribh???s.  I wrote about this some time ago in JESHO 2005 (I?ll send you the article separately).

Other, more familiar uses of paribh??? also occur when an author defines terms.  For example, at Mit?k?ar? (Ydh) 1.366, Vij??ne?vara says the verse is a paribh??? of the author?s own treatise, defining the meaning of highest, middle, and lowest fines.  The term occurs several other times in the Mit?k?ar?.

Hope that gives you some more to go on.

Best, Don

Subject: [INDOLOGY] paribh???s in dharma??stra?

Greetings to all, namaskaromi --

Perhaps you know of secondary literature concerning the use of so-called paribh???s, or interpretive rules by any name, in dharma??stra particularly. Of course P. V. Kane has laid the ground in Chapter XXX of History of Dharma??stra, volume 5.

I am also interested in explicit mentions of the word 'paribh???' in works of dharma??stra. I've already unearthed a few by searching the texts on GRETIL.

I would be honored and delighted to receive your advice and suggestions.

All the best,
Jo
