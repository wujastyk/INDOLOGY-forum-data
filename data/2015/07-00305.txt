Dating of Old Tamil Cankam Literature
I would like to know the state of scholarly reception of Prof. Tieken?s dating of Ca?kam literature to the 8th or 9th century CE. I would appreciate if the list members could point to Indologists who agree with Prof. Tieken?s views or publications that cite Prof. Tieken?s dating of Ca?kam literature with approval.
Thanks in advance
Regards,
