Subject: [INDOLOGY] /to/
Message-ID: <CAEzwJrCcfTBJ59+8EmG2-Rk4d-2mRdG6kp-XGgqSKrkKbyNeKw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Friends,

I'm currently collecting some data on spoken Sanskrit.

One dominant feature I have noticed in several different language nests
across geographically diverse parts of North India is the use of /to/.
During countless conversations over the last two months I have heard this
particle used many times, albeit always in the same syntactic position and
for the same semantic reason.

My question regards whether this /to/ particle is in any way to be
considered a Sanskrit particle or not?


This /to/ particle, as far as my understanding allows, is the intensifier
particle from Hindi and other MILs. It is located consistently following
the agent like in a Hindi sentence. This demonstrates, perhaps that the
grammatical scaffolding of spoken Sanskrit relies implicitly on the
syntactical structure of MILs like Hindi as a potential first language (L1)
of a speaker. Contextualising some more, I have heard this particle used by
my language consultants whose L1s are Malvi, Hindi, Assamese and Nepali.


Below are some brief examples to clarify my query.


1) Hindi            mai?      *to*       ghar    (ko)    j?t?   h??



2) Sanskrit       aha?     *to*       g?he             gacch?mi


As a Hindi speaker myself, I find I am also using this /to/ particle in the
same way to create emphasis.

3)                     aha?    *to      *bubhuk??       asmi


I understand that the particle /tu/ in Sanskrit serves a similar semantic
function and I'm guessing it is the historical precedent of /to/. However,
my consultants are not using /tu/ they are using /to/!


For an audible example, in the latter stages (1 min 57-58 sec) of this clip
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHLIy-WHDew>  you can here the phrase

4)                   aha?   t*o*       sa?sk?ta?     j?n?mi'


The speaker in this clip is an L1 speaker of Malvi. More specifically
Umawadi Malvi, which is the dialect of Rajgarh Jhila, MP.


Reiterating my query more precisely, can I consider this to be a case of
code-mixing?

Thanks in advance for helping to clarify this point of interest for me.


All the best,
