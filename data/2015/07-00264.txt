Thank you Dr. Zydenbos for illustrating my point about human frailities in an academic discipline.

Unfortunately, you got the Indianzing backward. Here is my quote from the article you sent us:

?We were trying to do something which could not be done, and that is trying to Indian-ize the world in the name of Krishna,? Resnick said. 
In other words, as the article shows, I was rejecting the notion that a spiritual practice, originally coming from India, requires Indianization in terms of adopting Indian ethnic and cultural features associated with the tradition.

The issue of insider-outsider perspectives, the advantages and disadvantages of each, is a serious issue that has gained significant interest among many thoughtful scholars. My concern with meta-epistemological issues as they manifest in insider and outsider perspectives, and subsequently impact Indology, and the general study of sacred traditions, is not really ?nit-picking.?  Philosophy is like psychology: even if you don?t study it, you have one. 

All the best,
Howard
