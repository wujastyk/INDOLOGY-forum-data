Dear Jan,

Could you please elaborate on your parenthetical remark that '(Frits
Staal's theory on the Saamaveda therefore needs modification)'?  Frits
certainly was aware of the importance of saamans in the RV.  I am
constantly brooding about the riddles and enigmas of RV 1.164, which, as I
am sure you know, not only mentions saamans but also exhibits saaman-like
phonic patterns.  Frits and I frequently talked about these things over the
last decade  of his life.

I would be interested to hear a more elaborate comment.

Best wishes,

George
