Sorry, Trautmann's book is published by the University of Chicago Press.

Niranjan,

You might find Thomas Trautmann's Elephants and Kings: An Environmental History (Oxford 2015) helpful.

Best,
Mark

Dear Tyler,

Thank you so much for pointing out to me these two works on environmental history of India. While I need to prepare a half page write-up on the subject in a day or two, I'll see what ready-made material I could look at (for the time being).

Best,
Niranjan

Dear Niranjan,

Kalyanakrishnan Sivaramakrishnan and Mahesh Rangarajan have edited a
two volume environmental history of India that, while not always
dealing directly with the question of knowledge systems, often touches
upon them.  It might be a good starting point for finding references.
