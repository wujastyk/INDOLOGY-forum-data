Niranjan,
You might find Thomas Trautmann's Elephants and Kings: An Environmental History (Oxford 2015) helpful.
Best,

Dear Tyler,
Thank you so much for pointing out to me these two works on environmental history of India. While I need to prepare a half page write-up on the subject in a day or two, I'll see what ready-made material I could look at (for the time being).
Best,
Niranjan

Dear Niranjan,
Kalyanakrishnan Sivaramakrishnan and Mahesh Rangarajan have edited a
two volume environmental history of India that, while not always
dealing directly with the question of knowledge systems, often touches
upon them.  It might be a good starting point for finding references.
