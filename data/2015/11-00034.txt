[INDOLOGY] Database of manuscripts digitized by National Manuscript	Mission
Dear friends,
Sorry for cross posting.
I am attaching herewith a complete database of manuscripts digitized by

issue.
I am thankful to National Manuscript for Manuscript to have provided this
valuable data.

Total Manuscripts digitized - 2,10,573
Total Manuscript repositories - 51
Notes -
1. Each record has the following fields
Sr. No. ManusID Acc. No. Title Number of pages Script Repo Code Notes
2. Repository codes are placed in 'Abbrv' worksheet of the same file.
3. Because of different transliteration conventions used in base files, the
transliteration is not uniform
