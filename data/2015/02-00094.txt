[INDOLOGY] Examples of very ambiguous devanagari Sanskrit	sentences
Dear Dermot,
You are of course right that my response was not on target. Some of the earlier responses led me away from the specific focus of your question.
I don?t see, however, that Martin Gansten?s response met your requirement:
sa mene na and sam enena are distinct in the usual roman transcription, but they are also distinct in the usual printed devanagari:
? ???? ?        ??????
In case your system doesn?t read this devanagari, here is the same as transcribed into roman:
sa mene na           samenena
Cheers!
Elliot
