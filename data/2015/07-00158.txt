I don't know what this means. When my students want a grade on their 
papers  that are partially plagiarized, I'm speechless: what am I 
supposed to grade? The idea that the student caught plagiarizing has 
argued anything is undermined by the plagiarism. Like many on this list, 
I haven't read any of Malhotra's works. But, if it is the case that he 
takes a critical view of conventional Indology, that argument would be 
harder to make if he had to acknowledge his debt to the group that he is 
criticizing. The question is whether he can make his case without the 
plagiarism.  Where my students are concerned, it is usually that they 
can't, for what they wanted to claim as their original point isn't theirs.

Best wishes,
Shyam
