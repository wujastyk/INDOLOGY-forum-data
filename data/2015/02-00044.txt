[INDOLOGY] Midnapore plates
Dear colleagues,
Would anyone be able to furnish me a pdf of the following?
  Majumdar, R.C. 1945. ?Two Copper-Plates of ?a???ka from Midnapore.? Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal, Letters 11 (1): 1?9.
I have checked the amazing Biodiversity Heritage Library (http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org), which has many volumes published by the (R)ASB available in digital form, but apparently not this one.
Thanks.
