Dear colleagues,

Would anyone be able to furnish me a pdf of the following?


  Majumdar, R.C. 1945. ?Two Copper-Plates of ?a???ka from Midnapore.? Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal, Letters 11 (1): 1?9.
  

I have checked the amazing Biodiversity Heritage Library (http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org), which has many volumes published by the (R)ASB available in digital form, but apparently not this one.

Thanks.

Arlo Griffiths
