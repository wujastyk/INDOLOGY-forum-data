[INDOLOGY] bibliographic assistance request
Dear Colleagues,
Thanks to those who responded to my request for bibliographic assistance!
Both queries have been answered.
I expect to send to the publisher within the month a collection of papers on Sanskrit syntax with a lengthy survey by Professor Hans Henrich Hock and an extensive bibliography combining and revising the bibliography of him and Madhav Deshpande with Hock's update concerning syntactic research in the past 25 years.
I'll post a notice to the list when it becomes available.
Yours,
Peter
