If I understand correctly that means quite nearness of the systems ---
three languages in the secondary stage, two in the undergraduate stage and
only specialisation subject in the post-graduate.Relevantly there is
something more in India which has Sanskrit Universities where the long
reigning rules of the UGC do not necessarily prevail. According to rule one
knows just one language by training, that is Sanskrit! .
Is there any parallel to the Sanskrit Universities in the West? Theological
Universities?.
