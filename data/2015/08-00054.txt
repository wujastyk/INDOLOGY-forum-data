[INDOLOGY] Second-syllable rhyme in Dravidian
Dear Professor Nagaraj Paturi,
a difficult problem concerning those questions is how far back in time 
we can go for the various languages concerned.
The use of echo-word formation and reduplication may have been on the

301 have reduplication
77 have "echo"
