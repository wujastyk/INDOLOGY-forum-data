[INDOLOGY] Eight types of marriages ...
I apologise for posting the following without subject line :
One of the questions by Mr. V S Rajam was
What is told/informed to a bride and groom during the wedding ceremony
about ?marital fidelity??
bride and bride groom are made to take oath.
One of the most well known, popular oft-quoted is :
Bride's father : dharma cha Arthe cha kame chaishaa naaticharitavyaa
Bridegroom:
Naaticharaami.
For the remaining such oaths taken by bride and bridegroom during the
marriage ritual, you might want to refer to one of the huge number of
publications of Vivaha mantras abundantly available on and offline.
