Many thanks to Kumar Shankara for sending me the following information
about the availability of the *Jyoti?kara??aka* with the commentary of
Malayagiri:

The above book is available at Digital Library of India.
Jyotiskarndkam Prakirnam.

99999990321959. Vallabhachariya. 1928. sanskrit. Devotional. 268 pgs.

Although I tried searching for it at DLI under several other spelling
combinations, I would never have thought of trying this spelling.

My best to him,
