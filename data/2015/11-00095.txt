Dear Colleagues

Does anyone know the origin or the Sanskrit original of the claim often made about the Mah?bh?rata, 'Whatever is here is found elsewhere. But whatever is not here is nowhere else' ?

I have not been able to find it in the Ganguli-Roy translation, and without the Sanskrit I cannot search the online versions of the text.

Thanks in advance

McComas
