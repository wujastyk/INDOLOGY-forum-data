correction to my own correction: "1997, not 1977". very confusing, those 7s and 9s.

Dear colleagues,

A small correction to Hans' email with useful reminder of Chakrabarti's book Colonial Indology: it was published in 1997, not 1997.

I suspect the paradox may be explained as an instance of the condescension frequently displayed by scholars who position themselves in 'social sciences', as do many archaeologists, vis-?-vis scholars of Sanskrit in one or another the philological traditions that make up 'Indology'. I have the feeling that a hierarchy of sciences, with philolologists dangling at the bottom, is perhaps even more explicitly present in India than it is among scholars in the west, and the fact that Sanskrit studies in India don't generally attract the most talented students doesn't help. I have myself been accused by another well-known Indian historian of 'not being a historian'.
