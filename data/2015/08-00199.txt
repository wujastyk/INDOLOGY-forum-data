The Robert H. N. Ho Family Foundation Program in Buddhist Studies
<http://www.acls.org/programs/buddhist-studies/>, administered by
the American Council of Learned Societies <http://www.acls.org/about/>,
invites applications from colleges and universities wishing to establish
or expand teaching in Buddhist studies. This new opportunity for seed
funding complements other competitions funded by The Robert H. N. Ho
Family Foundation <http://www.rhfamilyfoundation.org/>.
  * Institutions of higher education from across the globe are eligible
    to apply for grants up to $300,000 (to be expended over four years)
    in support of new teaching positions in Buddhist studies.^1
  * Award funds should be used only for the new professor?s salary,
    benefits, and research expenses, not for indirect or administrative
    costs, or office expenses.
  * In addition, applicant institutions are welcome to request funds for
    costs related to a competitive search for the proposed position. The
    request must not exceed the $300,000 maximum award.
  * Applications must include a multi-year plan for matching at least
    1/3 of Foundation funding over the grant period, but the matching
    ratio need not be the same each year. (Please see a sample schedule
    for sequenced funding that meets the matching requirement here
<http://www.acls.org/uploadedFiles/Fellowships_and_Grants/Competitions_and_Deadlines/2015_onward_-_materials/New_Buddhist_Studies_Professorships.pdf>.)
  * A letter must be attached to the application from the institution? s
    president, vice-chancellor, rector, provost, or dean expressing the
    institution?s commitment to maintain the seeded position as a
    permanent, tenure-track post after the expiration of The Robert H.
    N. Ho Family Foundation funding.
  * The heart of the application will be an essay outlining the proposed
    position?its responsibilities, departmental location, and fit with
    the institution?s mission and curricular plans. The essay should
    also describe the search for filling the new position, including the
    qualifications sought in potential applicants.
Online application forms will be available at ofa.acls.org/
<https://ofa.acls.org/> in *mid-September 2015*.
Completed applications must be submitted through the ACLS Online
Fellowship Application system no later than 9 pm Eastern Standard
Time,* January 20, 2016*.
Questions should be directed to buddhiststudies at acls.org

^1 Buddhist studies are present in many academic disciplines and
specializations. Some of the fields engaged in the study of Buddhist
traditions as well as contemporary developments are history, philosophy,
archaeology, art history, anthropology, philology, and studies of
religion. For the purpose of this competition, Buddhist studies are
defined broadly.
