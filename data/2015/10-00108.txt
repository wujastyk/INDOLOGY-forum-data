Subject: [INDOLOGY] Indic Script identification: De Jong Collection Manuscripts
In-Reply-To: <DUB114-W131982A60FE8BF0BDA6C618A5240@phx.gbl>

It was clear to me as soon as I looked at the first two pictures that 
they are some sort of Tai script, since many of the aksaras are similar 
if not identical to those found in modern standard Thai. I'm not very 
familiar with other Tai scripts, however, so I showed the pictures to 
Justin McDaniel of Penn, and he said that they are written in the Lanna 
script, i.e., the script of the Lanna kingdom of Chiang Mai. There are, 
however, some modern features probably borrowed from Lao.

Best,
