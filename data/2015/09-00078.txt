[INDOLOGY] who is the deity on the photograph?
The image has eight hands. A??abhuj? is Durgaa with eight hands. There are
quite a few temples of this deity. One is situated at Vindhyachal on the
left bank of the Ganges in Mirzapur near Varanasi.
I apologise for double posting. It was posted out of thread that could
create confusion.
