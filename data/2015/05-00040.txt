[INDOLOGY] query [regarding the correct version of a defectively cited verse]
Dear Ashok,
I can agree with (a), which is why I didn't make my suggestion 
immediately, but regarding (b) I'm afraid I see plenty of worse 
transcription/transmission errors (we have to make allowance for oral 
transmission as well) than ?? -> ?: . As for (c), I see no difference 
between the implicit 'exists' in the third p?da and the implicit 'exist' 
in the second, should we accept my suggested alternative. Also, like 
Walter, I have seen several similar expressions in other places. But I 
certainly don't insist on it; it just strikes me as plausible.
Best wishes,
Martin
