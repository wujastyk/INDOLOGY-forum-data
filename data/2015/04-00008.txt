[INDOLOGY] Resources for learning Newari script
Harry,
One of the best references for Newa lipi is in Manandhar and Leinhard's catalogue of the Nepalese manuscripts held at Berlin. I'm at a conference right now and don't have access to the volume or a scan, but the introductory chapter there is an invaluable resource for understanding the script and dating of Newar materials and it includes scans of actual aksaras, rather than the ideal types that modern Newar pandits tend to draw in their teaching manuals. If you look at this together with Hemraj's book it's a good start.
Lienhard, Siegfried, and Thakur Lal Manandhar. 1988. Nepalese Manuscripts. Part 1: Nev?r? and Sanskrit (in The) Staatsbibliothek Preussischer Kulturbesitz, Berlin. Verzeichnis Der Orientalischen Handschriften in Deutschland XXXIII,1. Stuttgart: Franz Steiner Verlag.
Good luck!
Be well,
?WBTD.
