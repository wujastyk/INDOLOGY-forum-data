Hi

Velankar in the Jinaratnako?a (reference below) lists manuscripts of four separate works entitled Karmavip?ka (p. 72-73) (nothing listed matches Karmavip?k?rkam) unfortunately.

I have no idea if these are relevant to your question but you make like to explore more:

(1) Karmavip?ka of Gargar?i ((7 commentaries extant), published Bhavnagar in samvat 1972 (JAS series; no 52) 
(2) K. of Devendras?ri (2 commentaries extant)
(3) K. of ?ubha??la Ga?i (1 manuscript known)
(4) K. of Mallid?sa (2 manuscripts known)

Velankar, H.D., 1944, Jinaratnako?a: an alphabetical register of Jain works and authors (vol. 1 works (no more published)), Bhankarkar Oriental Research Institute, Poona.
