[INDOLOGY] Metrically restored Rgveda and traditional recitation
13 01 15
I too have to apologise for *??yo*/*??iyo* instead of *???yo*/*???iyo*.
Among others, there is no evidence that sandhi was compulsory in the Vedic
verse at least till the composition of the Paippal?da-Sa?hit?. There is a
saying quoted by Bha??oji D?k?ita on SK 2232 (P 8.4.18) and ascribed to
Bhart?hari (not found in the V?kyapad?ya) telling where sandhi is
compulsory. The saying does not mention verse as calling for compulsory
sandhi. It was the norm, that I admit, but not in the early Vedic days nor
even in P??ini's time. By the time of the RP the ?gveda had started to be
read as a Sa?hit?  that is as a sandhied text and the old metrical balance
was lost. That compelled the RP to enunciate rules of disyllabic reading
which had been the only norm at the time of composition.
The above requires elaboration and that is possible. But this is no place
for that. But I mention one classical verse that reads unsandhied
*Yo dhruv??i parityajya adhruv??i ni?evate/ dhruv??i tasya na?yani adhruva?
na??am eva ca/ * The 'queer' phenomenon raised many eyebrows. Some even
emended *hy adhruv??i* and *hy adhruva?* in violation of manuscript
readings. That was unfair.
