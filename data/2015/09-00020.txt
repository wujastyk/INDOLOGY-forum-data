[INDOLOGY] Nyaya discussions on faulty examples
NS 1.1.25 defines the d.r.s.Anta by stating that it must be something the meaning of which is commonly understood by laukika-s and (presumably more discerning or at least better trained) parIk.saka-s.  
1.1.25: laukikaparIk.sakANAM yasminn arthe buddhisAmyaM sa d.r.s.tAnta.h.
I think this is a fascinating and wise way to formulate the matter, and I think it partially answers your query.
Cheers,
John
