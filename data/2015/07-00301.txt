[INDOLOGY] meters and songs: the Vedas /// Re: Does anyone know of Sanskrit works that use 2nd-syllable rhyming
Dear Prof Paturi,
Re: the statement which you forwarded, apparently with approval. This is
purely hypothetical and beyond verification as the oldest text sufficiently
attested that uses and reflects on verse-meters,
the Rgveda, is also permeated by the knowledge and employment of
"song-forms": saamans (Frits Staal's theory on the Saamaveda therefore
needs modification). It was observed long ago by Oldenberg that the oldest
textbook of the Saamaveda is the Rgveda itself: large parts are apparently
from the beginning composed for the sake of "Saamavedic" employment.
The absence of even a trace of Saamans and Saamaveda in the Avestan
tradition vs. its pervasive presence in the Vedic tradition is remarkable
and not compensated by the presence in both traditions of the genre of the
Gaatha.
