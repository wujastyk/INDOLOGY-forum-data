Dear Colleagues,
In the autobiographical speech that he delivered in Pune in 1875, Day?nanda Sarasvat? declared that he was an ud?cya brahmin ; that the ud?cya brahmins were sam?ved?, but that he himself was made to study the Yajurveda (adding ?with some difficulty?). See Bhav?n?l?la Bh?rat?ya, P?na pravacana ? Upade?a ma?jar?, Ajmer, Vaidika pustak?laya, 1985, p. 111. Note that in the autobiography published in October 1879 by the theosophists, DS does not mention his Vedic affiliation at all (The Theosophist I, 1, p. 9-12)Best,
Catherine Clementin-Ojha, Paris

Objet: Re: [INDOLOGY] Vedic/Sutra affiliation

Dear Colleagues,I dont know the answer (but like very much to learn it), but one fact is that at least in some parts of India ?gveda is considered more prestigious than others. I have met Brahmans in South India, who proudly announce to belong to Rigveda, but when asked about their Shakha, admit to belong to Apastamba.Best,KlausKlaus KarttunenSouth Asian and Indoeuropean StudiesAsian and African Studies, Department of World CulturesPL 59 (Unioninkatu 38 B)00014 University of Helsinki, FINLANDTel +358-(0)2941 4482418Fax +358-(0)2941 22094Klaus.Karttunen at helsinki.fiOn 19 Aug 2015, at 14:37, Madhav Deshpande <mmdesh at umich.edu> wrote:Dear Colleagues,     We know that each Brahmin is affiliated traditionally with a particular Veda/Shakha and a particular S?tra.  However, what is the ritual affiliation for those Brahmins who are traditionally called Dvivedi, Trivedi and Chaturvedi?  Do they have concurrent multiple Vedic/Sutra affiliations?  I was told by the Ratate family in Banaras that their personal Vedic affiliation is with ?gveda, and yet academically/professionally they became Atharvavedins.  I am wondering if the situation with Dvivedis, Trivedis and Chaturvedis is similar, in the sense that they academically study two, three or four Vedas, and yet have a particular one Veda as their family affiliation.  Any information, including textual references, would be helpful.  With best wishes,Madhav DeshpandeAnn Arbor, Michigan, USA-- Madhav M.
