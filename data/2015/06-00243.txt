Suresh:
 Perhaps a ?courageous-weak-female-conquers-physically-strong-male?
paradigm is the original notion at its basis. This could have found various
forms of expression, and the ?*?a??-sarpa*-ny?ya? may very well have taken
shape as a witty ad-hoc Sanskritization of internalized popular sayings.
They might possibly draw on the behaviour of animals entirely different
from hares and snakes. As stated initially, I was immediately reminded of
Gandhiji?s ?violence of the mouse against the cat?. On second thoughts
however ? inspired by the empirical evidence of the ?Go, Mr. Bunny, kill
that snake!? video ? I have my doubts, whether such a ny?ya would be
conceivable at all. Is it likely that a mouse behaves violently against a
cat, and that observations of that kind had really been made? Could Jan
possibly contribute a live video footage to solve this question? :-)
I changed upon three instances using a ?weaker female / stronger male?
metaphor taken from the animal kingdom. The female (Queen Ko?? from
Kashmir) is compared to a mouse, to a (female) jackal, and to a bird
respectively, her male opponents however to a cat and a lion. Guess, who
wins! I for one failed to find traces of heroic courage in it.
