[INDOLOGY] Derrett's 'Development of the Concept of Property in	India'
Dear List,
Might anyone have a scan of Duncan J. Derrett's 'Development of the Concept
of Property in India c. A.D. 800-1800'?
This is found both in *Zeitschrift f?r Vergleichende Rechtswissenschaft*,
vol. 64, pp. 15-130 and *Essays in Classical and Modern Hindu Law*, v. II.
I don't have access to either volumes here and ILL can only secure vol
1 of *Essays
in Classical and Modern Hindu Law*.
Many thanks,
Samuel Wright
Nalanda University
