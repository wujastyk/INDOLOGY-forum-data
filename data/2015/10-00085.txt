/Vaiy?karan?asiddh?ntabh?s?an?a/, also known as /Vaiy?karan?abh?s?an?a,/ is an 
authentic text in P??iniansemantics. It is a commentary on the 
/Vaiy?karan?amatonmajjana/ compiled by the great grammarian Bha??oji 
D?k?ita (17^th c.),and is written by Kaun?d?abhat?t?a, the nephew of 
Bha??oji. The main intention is to refute the objections raised by 
Naiy?yikas and M?m??sakason various aspects of P??iniansemantics and to 
establish the grammarians? views on the subject. 
/Vaiy?karan?asiddh?ntabh?s?an?as?ra/, an abridged version of the 
/Vaiy?karan?abh?s?an?a/, also written by Kaun?d?abhat?t?a, is the more famous 
text with more than ten commentaries written on it. But nobody has so 
far attempted to write a commentary on the /Vaiy?karan?abh?s?an?a/ and 
though the text has been published four times from different places, 
none of them can be treated as a critical edition.

The /Vaiy?karan?abh?s?an?a /is being published here with the /Niran?jan? 
/commentary by Pandit Ramyatna Shukla, and critical notes (/Prak??a/) by 
the editor. The edition itself is prepared taking a 17^th c. manuscript 
as base, and comparing it with 40 other manuscripts from different parts 
of India, and with printed versions. The present volume contains the 
first part of the work and is devoted to the meaning of roots and verbal 
suffixes which is at its heart.

*Keywords:*Grammar, Sanskrit, Paninian semantics, commentary
