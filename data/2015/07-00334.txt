[INDOLOGY] Tagore, Aurobindo, and Malhotra
I concur with those who believe that this thread has long outlived its usefulness.
The positions of all who have contributed are known.
As a Tibetan friend once said: if you just want to go around in circles, there's more
merit in doing circumambulations.
I think it's time to call a halt.
