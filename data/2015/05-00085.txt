[INDOLOGY] Sources for verses on fate/karma
I, too, am interested in this verse on karma, and in the very old source
reference for it kindly provided by Walter. For those who do not have the
1925-1930 Benares edition of the Prasastapadabhashyam that includes the
Vyomavati commentary, this verse is found on p. 3 of vol. 1 of the improved
edition of the Vyomavat? edited by Gaurinath Sastri (Varanasi: Sampurnanand
Sanskrit Vishvavidyalaya, 1983). Gaurinath Sastri there adds in parentheses
references to Dev?-bh?gavata 9.29.69-70 and 40.73.
