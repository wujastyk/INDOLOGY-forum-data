[INDOLOGY] Indic Script identification: De Jong Collection	Manuscripts
Dear Clemency,
The two images that you have labelled Tibetan Manuscript 1 and Tibetan
Manuscript 2 are definitely in Tibetan. Possibly if we had a scan of the
other side of the folio in Tibetan Manuscript 2 we could determine the
title. After the first phrase, which continues a sentence from the other
side, it gives a series of homages: homage to the Buddha, homage to the
dharma, homage to the sangha, etc.
Best regards,
