[INDOLOGY] Fwd: Fun media piece about the Mitanni: Sanskrit in Ancient Syria
Re: [INDOLOGY] Fun media piece about the Mitanni: Sanskrit in
Ancient Syria
Dear Prof. Paturi,
These 'ancient pastoral nomads' were pre-literate.  They didn't write any
horse-training books.  The horse-training book was written by someone named
Kikkuli, and he wrote it in Hittite, not Vedic.  In his Hittite
horse-training manual there are some clearly pre-Vedic words that refer to
horse-training and certain Vedic gods.  Kikkuli was transcribing into
Hittite the words of these pre-Vedic nomads who taught the Hittites about
horse-training.
The article that Dominik refers to is a a rather teasing critique of Modi,
et al.  It is not scholarly, but it gets the facts right for the most
part.  Its main point is that the OIT theory is not supported by any good
evidence.  It cites reliable sources like Anthony and the encyclopedia of
IE by Mallory and Adams.  If you want to consider what Vedicists think
about this, see Mayrhofer and Thieme, just as a start.
Best wishes, as always,
George
