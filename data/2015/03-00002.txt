I participated in this program last year and was able to document a substantial corpus of inscriptions on stone and metal surfaces in Myanmar. I warmly recommend those who need very high quality visual documentation of inscribed objects, whether manuscripts or inscriptions, to apply for participation in this very well set-up training program run by very competent people. From my experience, RTI is perhaps better suited for smaller objects (say 0.5m x 0.5 m or smaller) than for big stone inscriptions, and the object being relatively flat also makes the technique more realistically applicable than it is for texts engraved on an object in the round. I think coins, for instance, would be ideal.
Best wishes,
