[INDOLOGY] query [regarding the correct version of a defectively cited verse]
The wording bears a resemblance to, and seems to be a modification or
extension of the well-known *bh?micchidrany?ya*, occuring also on a great
number of copper-plates especially from Northern India. At their core, the
formulas contain *?candr?rkak?iti-*. They relate to grants and intend to
secure their everlasting duration: ~~ ?as long as the sun and the moon ...
would last?.
The meaning of this Ny?ya has been explained by Oskar von Hin?ber (Der
*bh?micchidrany?ya*, in: Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenl?ndischen
Gesellschaft, 155, 2005, S. 484-495).
In the present case, Vi?var?pa?s commentary on Y?j?avalkyasm?ti 1.316 may
help, as he says: *bh?micchidrany?yen? candr?t sthitisa?sth?na? k?rayet*
(cp. von Hin?ber, p. 491).
So there is external evidence to support at least *sthiti* as proposed
earlier.
