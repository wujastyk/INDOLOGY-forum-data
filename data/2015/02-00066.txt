[INDOLOGY] Examples of very ambiguous devanagari Sanskrit	sentences
Dear Harry,
There is also something in one of the stories from the Kath?sarits?gara
quoted by Lanman in his reader: Section 26 (pp. 49-53) = vi.108-164, which
Lanman calls 'The king who didn't know his Sanskrit grammar'. The crucial
scene is one where the king misinterprets
modakair (= m? udakaih) deva parit??aya m?m '*don't* pelt me *with
water*/throw water at me'
as
modakair etc 'pelt me *with sweets*'.
(His ignorance thus revealed, he then needs to go ahead and study Sanskrit
properly.)
Maybe this helps?
All best,
     Antonia
