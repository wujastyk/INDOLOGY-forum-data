[INDOLOGY] The Vrttidipika of Krsnabhatta/ Jayakrsna Maunin
Dear Rohana,
     I am almost certain I have a print copy of this work at home in Ann
Arbor.  I am currently in Pune and will return to Ann Arbor by mid-March.
If you are unable to obtain a soft-copy by then, do contact me in March.
If you do receive a soft-copy, do pass it on to me.  With best wishes,
Madhav Deshpande
