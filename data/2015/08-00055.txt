Dear Professor Paturi,

are you in agreement with the statements made by Dr R. Nagaswamy?

There would be much to say about the topics which he deals with (and 
espacially on the distinction to be made between what the Tolk?ppiyam 
says and what the commentators say) but a mailing list is probably not 
the best place for such an exchange, which might become time-consuming. 
Therefore I shall not comment further.
I feel I have already posted too much today...

You might want to have a look at a small article I wrote on the topic of 
the use of yamaka in one of the hymns of T?v?ram:

Best wishes
