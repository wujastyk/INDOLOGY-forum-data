Dear Colleagues,
Might one of you have a pdf of, or a working link to, Antoine L?onard de 
Ch?zy's review of the grammar of Sanskrit by Charles Wilkins in the 
/Moniteur /of 1810?  Some sources give the no. 30, others no. cxlvi.  It 
is 15 pages long, but I don't know the beginning and end pages.  I have 
looked at the usual places, including Gallica, without success.  I would 
be grateful.
