Subject: [INDOLOGY] rubrication in Indian mss.

even farther.... but it is not without relevance that Friday Richard
Salomon delivered the Gonda Lecture in Amsterdam with the title "HOW THE
BUDDHA LEARNED HIS ABCS: ON TEACHING WRITING IN THE ANCIENT WORLD". Writing
tablets played a large part in his discussion; he has promised a full
publication of his remarks (it looked to me that his actual manuscript was
at least double the length of the lecture he delivered), with ample
illustrations, in the near future. Since he reads this list I assume that
once he recovers from his jet-lag he'll be able to say something himself :)
best, Jonathan
