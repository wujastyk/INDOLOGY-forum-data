[INDOLOGY] Resources for learning Newari script
I used Rabison Shakya?s useful little book *Alphabet of the Nepalese Script.*  It teaches several important Nepalese scripts, including Newari.  It may be hard to come by outside of Nepal, but you could borrow it from a library: http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/53206053
