[INDOLOGY] Texts and bodily metaphors (Fenicio, Trancoso, etc. on the Vedas)
Thanks for these clarifications, Christophe.
Gon?alo Fernandes Trancoso's source for his knowledge of the Vedas was
Nobili's informant (and convert) ?ivadharma/Bonifacio. ?upanov traced their
relationship in *Disputed Mission* and now Margherita Trento has done
fascinating further work on them. One notable difference is that Fernandes
didn't read Sanskrit, but relied on translations into Tamil. While there's
been some debate about how direct Nobili's access was, on the basis of his
orthography Caland thought it likely that ?Nobili himself had copied the
passages [in Sanskrit] quoted by him, and that these passages were had not
been dictated to him by some Brahman? [and therefore] that Nobili has
himself drawn his argumentative passages from the Sanskrit texts? (?Roberto
de? Nobili and the Sanskrit Language and Literature.? *Acta Orientalia *III
(1924): 50?51).
Lucena, writing in 1599, used Couto's manuscript (completed in 1597).
