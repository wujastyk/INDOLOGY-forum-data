[INDOLOGY] Hindi v Sanskrit
This is fascinating ? thanks. I have gone over a good part of Sangam literature carefully and cannot remember ever finding a relative clause, though of course this doesn?t mean they didn?t exist. Certainly they are fairly common in modern Tamil. It would be interesting to know when they first appear in the literature and whether they are documented in other premodern Dravidian literatures. Regarding word order, it is true, as Susan Herring shows, that old Tamil often does not put the finite verb at the end. But it should be noted that in the case of  converbials (adverbial participials) and adjectival participles, the verb form always comes at the end of its phrase ? nothing after it can be construed with it unless it is the noun construed with the participial adjective, in which case the noun must directly follow it or (occasionally) be very near it. In this way, the word order of old Tamil is thoroughly constrained, as far as I can see. Sanskrit, obviously, is completely different, allowing related words to be far apart.
I am looking forward to finding out about the theories of Pilot-Ramichoor and Murugaiyan about pre-old-Tamil morphology ? hope they are published.
I am glad my mistake (saying Hindi was right-branching) led to a very intriguing discussion. George Hart
