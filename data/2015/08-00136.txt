This is fascinating ? thanks. I have gone over a good part of Sangam literature carefully and cannot remember ever finding a relative clause, though of course this doesn?t mean they didn?t exist. Certainly they are fairly common in modern Tamil. It would be interesting to know when they first appear in the literature and whether they are documented in other premodern Dravidian literatures. Regarding word order, it is true, as Susan Herring shows, that old Tamil often does not put the finite verb at the end. But it should be noted that in the case of  converbials (adverbial participials) and adjectival participles, the verb form always comes at the end of its phrase ? nothing after it can be construed with it unless it is the noun construed with the participial adjective, in which case the noun must directly follow it or (occasionally) be very near it. In this way, the word order of old Tamil is thoroughly constrained, as far as I can see. Sanskrit, obviously, is completely different, allowing related words to be far apart.

I am looking forward to finding out about the theories of Pilot-Ramichoor and Murugaiyan about pre-old-Tamil morphology ? hope they are published.

I am glad my mistake (saying Hindi was right-branching) led to a very intriguing discussion. George Hart

This freedom is often contrasted with the supposedly very rigid structure of Modern Dravidian. However, Susan Herring has furnished excellent evidence from Old Tamil attesting to a fair amount of phrase-order freedom, includiing structures that are verb-initial, with all other elements extraposed to the right. I have observed similar freedom (through interviews) in a colloquial variety of Modern Kannada, and I suspect that the rigidity attributed to the modern (literary) languages is an effect of diglossia, similar to the relatively more rigid sentence structure of modern literary German, as contrasted with colloquial or dialectal varieties.

The latter had for a long time been considered to be Indo-Aryan borrowings in Dravidian (and some linguists considered the Indo-Aryan counterparts to somehow reflect an innovation, triggered by contact with Dravidian); but starting with research by Ramasamy, Lakshmi Bai, and Steever, it has become clear that the structures are indigenous to Dravidian, and I have presented arguments and evidence that the Sanskrit/Indo-Aryan structures are inherited from Proto-Indo-European.

Whether this should be considered evidence for ?right branching? or ?mixed right- and left-branching? might be subject to debate (fueled, in many cases, by theory-internal or even ideological considerations). What is important to know, however, is that relative-correlatives are a common phenomenon in languages that would otherwise be considered ?rigid? SOV/verb-final or left-branching.

Recent publications by Pilot-Raichoor (with Murugaiyan) suggest that prehistoric (i.e. pre-Old Tamil) Dravidian may have been very different in its morphology and, by implication, in its morphosyntax, with traces still observable in Old Tamil and elsewhere. At this point, these publications do not seem to have been subjected to the (obligatory) vetting process; from personal experience I know that many Dravidologists are skeptical. Nevertheless, this work suggests that we need to be cautious concerning claims about the syntactic similarities and differences between Indo-Aryan and Dravidian at, say, 1500 BC.
