In his "Literary Gleanings" published in The Quarterly Journal of the Andhra Historical Resarch Society 2/2, 1927, pp. 130-145, M. R. Kavi notes (I attach the relevant pages below) that one Buddhist B?hy?rthasiddhi is quoted in :
1? the Prakara?apa?cik? of ??likan?tha Mi?ra
[ch. 8,  = Gretil input, 923-924 : api c?prak???tmana eva prak??as sambhavat?ti b?hy?rthasiddh?v uktam /
in fact there is a previous reference, 778 :  nir?k?ta? c?ya? b?hy?rthasiddh?v ?juvimal?y?m / ? which one is misleading since the ?juvimal? is the title of ??likan?tha own commentary on Prabh?kara's B?hat?]
2? [if I understand well] the ?arkarik? of "Bha??aputra" Jayami?ra (ed. Kunhan Raja, MUSS 17, 1946, not checked; which is a continuation of Umbeka's commentary on Kum?rila's ?lokav?rttika).
Could the so-referred work correspond to the B?hy?rthasiddhi-k?rik?n?ma of ?ubhagupta preserved in Tibetan translation (a Sanskrit reconstructed text by N. A. Shastri [?< Bulletin of Tibetology 4, 1967?] is available on the DSBC : http://www.dsbcproject.org/canon-text/titles/B?hyarthasiddhik?rik?n?ma-0 ) and recently dealt with by M.S. Saccone ("S?ubhagupta on the Cognitive Process") in the Journal of Indian Philosophy 42/2-3, 2014 pp. 377-399, and by H. Matsuoka (in the Journal of Indian and Buddhist Studies 61, 2013, pp. 1241-47) through its references in S??ntarak?ita's Tattvasa?graha ?
Thank you for any comment on this.
Best wishes,
