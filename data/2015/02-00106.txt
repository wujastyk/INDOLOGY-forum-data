[INDOLOGY] Electronic issues of The Pandit
Dear colleagues,
I am trying to find electronic editions of "The Pandit" which contain
Raghunatha Siromani's Padarthatattvanirupana along with the commentaries
of Ramabhadra and Raghudeva. I have some of the issues from DLI, but as
far as I can see the following are not available there:
No. 26 (1904)
28 (1906)
34 (1912)
35 (1913)
36 (1914)
If anyone knows of any digitised editions, I would be very grateful if you
could contact me off-list.
Best regards,
Michael Williams,
