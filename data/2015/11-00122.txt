Many thanks to the prompt response and helpful tips from Will and Artur. We managed to find Chu?y? Bah?l not far from Thamel and the priest there kindly gave us many useful information about the temple and the wood-carvings, including those of the saptav?ra and 27 nak?atras. Those who are interested in some of the pictures we have taken may check out these links:
