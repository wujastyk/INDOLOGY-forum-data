Dear Indologists,

Inspired by the tales of so many,  I now ask for a digital version of

Jagannatha Panditaraja by V.A. Ramaswami Sastri
Annamalai University Sanskrit Series No. 8
Annalmalainagar, 1942

The is not found on the DLI, nor could I find it on Google books, or the
Oxford links so kindly posted recently.

I have a photocopy of the book, but I seek a pdf to lighten my load while
traveling.

best,
Tim Cahill
