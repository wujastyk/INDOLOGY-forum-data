[INDOLOGY] Jagannatha Panditaraja by V.A. Ramaswami Sastri	(1942)
Dear Indologists,
Inspired by the tales of so many,  I now ask for a digital version of
Jagannatha Panditaraja by V.A. Ramaswami Sastri
Annamalai University Sanskrit Series No. 8
Annalmalainagar, 1942
The is not found on the DLI, nor could I find it on Google books, or the
Oxford links so kindly posted recently.
I have a photocopy of the book, but I seek a pdf to lighten my load while
traveling.
best,
Tim Cahill
