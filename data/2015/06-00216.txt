Anukramanis - warning - mentions Talageri in passing
I believe it's Talageri's second book that he says is based on the Anukramanis. Witzel replied: Which ones? This seemed to leave Talageri nonplussed.
Can anyone recommend further reading on the Anukramanis? Apart from a few sources, it's not an area I've been able to find much information about.
Best,
Dean
