[INDOLOGY] Amartya Sen and Asoka
In his book The Argumentative Indian Amartya Sen mentions the Asokan inscriptions several times. On p. 18 he quotes
"the translation presented by Vincent A. Smith in Asoka:The Buddhist Emperor of India ...except for some minor emendations based
on the original Sanskrit text" (note 26, p.360).
I am very puzzled by this. I admit I have only read Jules Bloch's Les inscriptions d'Asoka, which are translated from different Prakrit
inscriptions. I wonder where did Amartya Sen find "the Sanskrit original"? Has anybody else seen it? I very much would like to see 
"the original Sanskrit".
