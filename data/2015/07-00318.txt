Friends,

I'm no lawyer, but "plagiarism" is not usually a legal issue, unless there
is a strong case for fraud or copyright infringement. It is an ethical
issue, prohibited not by the law but by codes of conduct at universities,
or an internalized sense of acting in good faith as scholars, giving credit
where credit's due, and so on. There are a few widely-accepted definitions
of plagiarism, but this discussion will never end if we try to adjudicate
the matter. In any case, it's up to the copyright holders to take legal
action.

All of us probably had opinions about RM's agitations before the plagiarism
accusations. I don't suppose any of those opinions have been changed; mine,
at least, has been confirmed. I appreciated hearing about the matter
through INDOLOGY, but I think we have been in the "diminishing returns"
part of the discussion for some time.

Andrew
