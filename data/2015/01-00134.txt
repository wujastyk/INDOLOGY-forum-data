Dear Suresh,


Thank you for your comments.


You said:


Besides connecting m?c- with m?k-, the attempt to connect with alay- 'to shake' is extremely problematic, as it totally disregards retroflex /?/ in several languages such as Kota    moca?, Kannada    mosa?e, masa?e, Tulu    mosa?e, muda?e.  
  
   
  
  
In my personal communcation with Ganesan (about 3 years ago), I pointed out how his paper uses several    linguistically questionable statements and unsubstantiated opinions as well-established facts, making it excessively speculative and wishful thinking.  
  


I agree. 


You may be interested to know that there is a 13th century Tamil inscription in Timmasamudram in Cuddapah district which refers to a Somaskanda icon (Umaskanda sahitar) as Citra-meli-vitankar. (See pp. 44-45 in http://asi.nic.in/nmma_reviews/indian%20archaeology%201968-69%20a%20review.pdf .) This icon was most probably set up by the translocal organization of cultivators called Citram??i Peiyan????r.  Sitting with Um? and Skanda, ?iva, as Som?skanda, is not known to be portrayed in the nude. For an example, see http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/sculptures-statues-figures/an-important-bronze-group-of-somaskanda-south-5538713-details.aspx .


Thus from the 8th century Tev?ram text by Cuntarar to the 13th century inscription above, the word 'vi?a?kar' had nothing to do with nudity. Dr. N. Ganesan's interpretation of vi?a?kar is not based on rigorous linguistic or philological work but on fanciful imagination.


I attended a lecture by Dr. Ganesan on January 3, 2015 in Plano, Texas. He tried to connect the religions of Indus civilization and Ca?kam age Tami?akam. During the Q&A/comment time, I told him that his etymologies did not work. I also told him that whatever might have been the features of the Indus culture, connecting them with the Tami?akam of the Ca?kam age was very problematic and pointed out that in the Ca?kam texts, the people of the neytal or seashore worshipped cu?avukkk??u (the bone of a type of fish such as a saw-shark or sawfish) and did not worship crocodile. 


What is surprising is the encouragement Ganesan's thesis seems to have gotten from scholars like K. Nachimuthu  (http://www.jnu.ac.in/FacultyStaff/ShowProfile.asp?SendUserName=knachimuthu). See https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/mintamil/????$20?????$204/mintamil/cILbeBnylUk/B8mRDLC7LvUJ .


By the way, Prof. V. I. Subramoniam Commemoration Volume's editorial board includes Prof. G. K. Panikkar, Prof. B. Ramakrishna Reddy, Prof. K. Rangan, 
and Prof. B. B. Rajapurohit. 


Regards,
Palaniappan

Palaniappan,  
   
  
  
I do not know what the interaction between Parpola and Ganesan has been in the past, but Parpola's 2011 paper already has some of the ideas discussed in Ganesan's paper. For instance, the following two paragraphs -- which I find very problematic -- attempt to connect mucali 'crocodile' with *m?k- 'to eat' and m?c- 'to cut'  
  
   
  
  
   
    
    This Proto-Dravidian etymon may be derived    
   
   
    
from  a  verbal root preserved only in North    
   
   
    
Dravidian *m?c- 'to cut (meat), to cut up into    
   
   
    
convenient pieces any object too large for use'    
   
   
    
(DEDR 5130). This verb, which describes quite    
   
   
    
well what a crocodile does after catching a victim    
   
   
    
that is too large to be directly swallowed, seems    
   
   
    
to be related to the Proto-Dravidian verbal root    
   
   
    
*m?k-/mokk-/*mok- 'to eat, to eat greedily in large    
   
   
    
mouthfuls, eat voraciously, devour, gobble, swallow'    
   
   
    
(DEDR 5127 + 4897). Tamil has derived moci- 'to    
   
   
    
eat' from this root.    
   
   
    
   
   
    
     This word for 'crocodile' may originally have    
   
   
    
been a compound involving two roots, the latter    
   
   
    
being Proto-Dravidian *alacu, *alay 'to shake or    
   
   
    
agitate in water (e.g., to rinse clothes or vegetables)'    
   
   
    
(DEDR 246), which is undoubtedly related to the    
   
   
    
root *ala?ku/*alakku, *alay 'to move, shake, wave,    
   
   
    
go to and fro for an object, roam, wander' (DEDR    
   
   
    
240). This etymological interpretation, however,    
   
   
    
necessitates a slight revision of Krishnamurti's    
   
   
    
Proto-Dravidian reconstruction (2003: 13, 531),    
   
   
    
which is *m?c-V-?- / *moc-V-?-. The compound    
   
   
    
nicely complements the first verb by describing the    
   
   
    
characteristic behaviour of the marsh and saltwater    
   
   
    
crocodile noted above (i.e., victims caught on land    
   
   
    
are dragged to the water and swallowed whole, while    
   
   
    
large prey is torn to pieces by means of twisting and    
   
   
    
shaking motions).    
   
  
  
   
  
  
Besides connecting m?c- with m?k-, the attempt to connect with alay- 'to shake' is extremely problematic, as it totally disregards retroflex /?/ in several languages such as Kota    moca?, Kannada    mosa?e, masa?e, Tulu    mosa?e, muda?e.  
  
   
  
  
In my personal communcation with Ganesan (about 3 years ago), I pointed out how his paper uses several    linguistically questionable statements and unsubstantiated opinions as well-established facts, making it excessively speculative and wishful thinking.  
  
   
  
  
   I think what is required is not a    piecemeal analysis of words, but a comprehensive investigation    animal names, plant names and other biota collected from all the languages of South Asia,       for a deeper understanding of the linguistic prehistory of the subcontinent.  
  
   
  
  
   Regards,  
  
   Suresh.

           It is interesting that Dr. Rajam should have mentioned Prof. Asko Parpola. I have found an interesting post by Dr. Ganesan. In this he says that Dr. Parpola has changed some of his etymologies based on Dr. Ganesan's input.  https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mintamil/enXUUa3WiAk/2P1pnvPRgdoJ
 
 Having read Dr. Parpola's 2011 article recently, I would be very interested to know if Dr. Parpola has changed the etymologies of words for crocodile           from what he postulated in his 2011 paper           and, if so, what his current etymologies are.         
          
          
          
          
          Thanks in advance.
