[INDOLOGY] Release of Sanskrit Heritage Engine software
Respected sir,
I tried for full 3 days with the instruction set given by you with the
machine.
I have not been able to set it up properly yet.
The most difficult part is setting up config file.
If you can provide a video tutorial about how to install the whole process
de novo, it would be highly useful.
I don't know whether it is the setup fault or apache2 fault.
After entering a word and pressing enter, the binary executable gets
downloaded instead of being executed.
