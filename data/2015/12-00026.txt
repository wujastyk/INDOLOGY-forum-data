Subject: [INDOLOGY] Image of Jai Singh II and Figueredo
Message-ID: <172935665febcdbb40@wm-srv.ulb.ac.be>

Dear friends of the Indology list,

Does anyone know where to find or can share with me a better resolution of the image attached ? I need it to illustrate the announcement of a lecture I will deliver in Brussels about the astronomical researches made by the Jesuits in India. If one knows another such image, I am also interested.

Best regards,

Dr Jean Michel Delire,
Lecturer in Science and civilization of India, University of Brussels
