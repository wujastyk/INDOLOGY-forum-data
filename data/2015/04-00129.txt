The Jain Studies Program at FIU welcomes you to the inauguration of the
Online Lecture Series on Jain Texts
          This program is launched to enrich textual studies in Jainism and nurture the study of ancient languages like Sanskrit, Prakrit, Apabra?sa and other Indic languages. This will promote, rejuvenate and invigorate scholarship and research on primary sources. Scholars will present their research on a chosen Jain text through interactive video conferencing.
              The text chosen for this year is the ?c?r??ga S?tra. We welcome you to the inauguration of the program with an introductory lecture on the text, followed by a series of four lectures. Each lecture will be approximately 50 to 60 mins with a discussion session to follow. The sessions will be hosted on Saturdays GMT  17.00 (5 PM). The video conference is open to all. The content will also be archived on the FIU Jain Studies Program website.
