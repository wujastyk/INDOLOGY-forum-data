Here are my 2 cents.
I have noticed a difference in the North India and South India. (My
exposure of North India is limited to Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh
and Uttar Pradesh).
One major difference between North India and South India is: typically in
South India a person is referred by his/her first name, while in the North
India s/he is referred by the surname.
In North India only close friends and family members refer a person by
his/her by given name. Whereas in South India everybody refers you by your
first name.
So in Hyderabad my students refer to me as Amba madam. It took me some time
to get adjusted to this, since in Maharashtra I could never imagine my
students calling me by my first name. They would always refer me by my
surname.
Similarly there is lot of confusion in the use of Mr. / Dr. / Prof etc.
While communicating in regional languages preference is for ???????? /
??????? / ??????? in Maharashtra, and use of '??' as an honorific suffix in
the North, ????  in the Andhra. Typically while translating into English,
all these are mapped to Mr./Ms.
