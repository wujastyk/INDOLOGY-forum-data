[INDOLOGY] Fwd: matta-matanga-lilakara dandaka
In Dr. K. K. Geethakumary's Metre in Sanskrit: A study with special reference to V?tt?vartika of R?map??iv?da, Calicut, Calicut Sanskrit Series no. 30, 2008,
- (pp. 98-99) about the da??aka-type of "metres with more than twentysix syllabes per line" it is said that their names "are determined on the basis of the number of Raga?a coming after two Naga?as" - so as no. 6, the L?l?k?ra? presents two Naga?as and twelve Raga?as. Then it is added that in classical literature especially in devotional lyrics and dramas, the upper limit of the number of syllabes has not been prescribed.
- (p. 92) a mattebha-vikr??ita metre is given but in this case it is a variety of 19 syllabes/each 4 p?das metre. 
Cf. differently for the latter in Anundoram Borooah, A comprehensive grammar of the Sanskrit language, analytical, historical and Lexicographical, vol. 10: Prosody, Calcutta : T.P. Brothers, 1882 (several reprints; available with the DLI) no. 387 (p. 147) where mattebha-vikr??ita is a variety of 20 syllabes/each 4 p?das metre; the same pp. 159-160 (no. 443) has what you are searching for : the mattam?ta?gal?l?kara as a variety of "other  da??aka-s", in which "every foot consists of nine or more middle lights" (with example).
Hope it can help,
Best wishes,
