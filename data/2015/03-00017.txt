In Dr. K. K. Geethakumary's Metre in Sanskrit: A study with special reference to V?tt?vartika of R?map??iv?da, Calicut, Calicut Sanskrit Series no. 30, 2008,
- (pp. 98-99) about the da??aka-type of "metres with more than twentysix syllabes per line" it is said that their names "are determined on the basis of the number of Raga?a coming after two Naga?as" - so as no. 6, the L?l?k?ra? presents two Naga?as and twelve Raga?as. Then it is added that in classical literature especially in devotional lyrics and dramas, the upper limit of the number of syllabes has not been prescribed.
- (p. 92) a mattebha-vikr??ita metre is given but in this case it is a variety of 19 syllabes/each 4 p?das metre. 

Cf. differently for the latter in Anundoram Borooah, A comprehensive grammar of the Sanskrit language, analytical, historical and Lexicographical, vol. 10: Prosody, Calcutta : T.P. Brothers, 1882 (several reprints; available with the DLI) no. 387 (p. 147) where mattebha-vikr??ita is a variety of 20 syllabes/each 4 p?das metre; the same pp. 159-160 (no. 443) has what you are searching for : the mattam?ta?gal?l?kara as a variety of "other  da??aka-s", in which "every foot consists of nine or more middle lights" (with example).

Hope it can help,
Best wishes,
Christophe

> Dear list,
> Does anyone have any information on a particular type of dandaka called the Matta-matanga-lilakara?
> 
> It consists of four padas which each start with two na-ganas (u u u) and then an unfixed amount of ra-ganas (- u -). 
> 
> I came across it with reference to the Shyamala Dandaka which falls into this category - although the Shyamala Dandaka has five padas rather than four. I am wondering where the name came from (could it be related to the Matangi of Shyamala Dandaka). I would also be grateful if anyone could tell me of any other dandakas that fall into this category.
