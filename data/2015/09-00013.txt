Dear All,
does anyone have a scanned version of Cunningham's Archaeological Survey 
Report, volume 3 (Report for the year 1871-72) that they are willing and 
able to share? Or point me toward a web link? I couldn't find this 
particular volume on Archive.org or DLI, nor anywhere else through 
Google. Google books does have several entries that may be this volume 
(e.g. 
https://books.google.com/books/about/Report_for_the_Year_1871_72.html?id=LpeFAAAAIAAJ; 
https://books.google.com/books/about/Archaeological_Survey_of_India_Reports.html?id=-wk3AQAAMAAJ), 
but these cannot be previewed, much less downloaded, at least from Hungary.
Thanks in advance,
Daniel
