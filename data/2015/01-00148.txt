[INDOLOGY] Vedic verse in Ortega y Gasset
25.1.15
It is the S?vitr? prayer, also called G?yatr?, that should be recited in
the three daily prayers of morning, midday and evening. Formerly its
recitation was the prerogative of the three 'upper' castes. The barrier was
broken by the ?rya Samajis and liberal Hindu leaders.
