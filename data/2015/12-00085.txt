[INDOLOGY] New Issues of E-Journal of Vedic Studies
Dear All, 
two new issues of EJVS vol. 22 are available now at our website http://ejvs.laurasianacademy.com <http://ejvs.laurasianacademy.com/>, and additionally now at our new location at the University of Heidelberg: http://crossasia-journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/ejvs/index <http://crossasia-journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/ejvs/index>. ? These are: 
Stefan Zimmer, on 6 new Vedic etymologies and the late Frits Staal about the reactions to his book on Nambudiri Veda Recitation (1961), some 50 years later.
(NB: Frits? paper is not yet uploaded at Heidelberg but accessible at Laurasian; eventually all old numbers of EJVS will become available at Heidelberg).
A Happy New Year to All !
Michael
