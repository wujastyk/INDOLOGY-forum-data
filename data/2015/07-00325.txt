Indology and plagiarism
Apart from borderline cases there are also cases of undeniable massive
plagiarism.
One case was discussed long ago by Roy Andrew Miller (JAOS 115.2 [1995]:
343-344), and
a new episode in the same case history was discussed eight years later, now
twelve years
ago, by me (AS/EA 57.1 [2003] p 163, author's copy academia.edu/7196478/ p
55).
