[INDOLOGY] INDOLOGY Digest, Vol 33, Issue 28
Dear Michael,
You are absolutely right that this could be the easiest way to explain the presence of the Yemen-origin copper plate in the area near Peshawar. The only problem with the 19th-century transfer hypothesis howeer is that the plate which I saw and photograhed was brought to a local antique dealer by a villager who explained he had found it in the fields (somewhere between Peshawar and Swat) and these are the same fields where villagers occasionally find Kushan coins etc. And he brought it to the dealer like many other antique items - for sale. It is rather unlikely (but certainly not impossible) that 19th century British citizen brought the plate from Yemen and deposited (or lost) it somewhere in the fields. 
Best wishes,
Piotr

Dear All,
This is a very interesting discussion, but I think it might be worth considering another possibility. As we all know, in the 19th and the first half of the 20th century Britain ruled both southern Yemen and India/Pakistan. Now, we also know that there are Ancient South Arabian inscriptions in the Bombay Museum and probably other museums in the Subcontinent (Norbert Nebes will be able to provide the details). Most British ships en route to India stopped at Aden to refuel, and it seems likely that these inscriptions were bought in Yemen by British or other travellers on their way to the Subcontinent where some of them, at least, were left. The antiquities market was already flourishing in Yemen during the 19th century and it is highly likely that finds from the north of Yemen (where there would have been very few commercial outlets) found their way to the international market in Aden. Of course, this is pure speculation but it seems to me a more likely explanation than that the plaque was taken to Pakistan in antiquity.
With best wishes,
Michael.
