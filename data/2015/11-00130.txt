Subject: [INDOLOGY] rubrication in Indian mss.

I wonder whether this may have something to do with the preparation of the palm leaves for either writing with a stylus or with pen and ink. The Southern mss were of the former type, and any pigment applied to it will erase off except in the incisions made by the stylus. The ones used in the north were often of the latter type. I have seen both types coming from Nepal. The palm leaves intended for ink would of course take any other pigment applied to it as well.

>> Red writing mixed in with ordinary black ink passages already is found in Chinese mss. in Dunhuang, some perhaps dating from as early as the fifth or sixth century (though not necessarily to mark headings -- its function and purpose is a bit more mysterious). The Dunhuang ms. site http://idp.bl.uk/ has online facsimiles of some, but I haven't time now to locate specific examples (and usually the urls are temporary so they are useless in emails -- one would have to identify text numbers, etc. and do a search text by text; perhaps someone who has that corpus closer to their fingertips than I do can guide you where to look). While I don't recall offhand any Indian texts there with similar features, it is likely that the practice was being transferred across cultures.
