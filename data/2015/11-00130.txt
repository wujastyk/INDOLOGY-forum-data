[INDOLOGY] rubrication in Indian mss.
I wonder whether this may have something to do with the preparation of the palm leaves for either writing with a stylus or with pen and ink. The Southern mss were of the former type, and any pigment applied to it will erase off except in the incisions made by the stylus. The ones used in the north were often of the latter type. I have seen both types coming from Nepal. The palm leaves intended for ink would of course take any other pigment applied to it as well.
