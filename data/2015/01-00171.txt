[INDOLOGY] Vedic verse in Ortega y Gasset
I also agree with George. Especially when one realizes that text was
transmitted orally. The sense is built in a different way when the text is
read. The recepient hears 'dhImahi" and then immediately 'dhiyo' which
triggers him to phonetic association with the verb just heard which as if
still sounds in his mind, Thus the double meaning of the 'dhImahi' can be
created. As Prof. Bhattacharya writes, there are many instances of
expressions which convey the meaning on the basis of their grammatical
structure and the phonetic associations.
