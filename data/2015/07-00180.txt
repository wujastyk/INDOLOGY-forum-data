[INDOLOGY] Query: Date of the Bhagavatam
Since no one has yet replied to this, perhaps there is not much new on this
question. As we all know, the continuing upab??ha?a, expansion or
supplementation, of the pur??as makes them almost impossible to date
accurately. Since their older parts may be separated from their later parts
by centuries, are we seeking the date of their latest redaction?
In the critical edition, *The Bh**?gavata* (ed. H. G. Shastri, Bharati K.
Shelat, K. K. Shastree, B.J. Institute of Learning and Research, Ahmedabad,
1996-1999), an "Epilogue" volume was published in 2002 (vol. 4, part 3),
which has just over two pages on "Time and Composition of the BGP" (pp.
15-17). K. K. Shastree there concludes (p. 16): "It means that the time of
composing the BGP is not earlier than the latter half of the 7th cent.,
A.D. and not later than the first half of the 8th cent., A.D."
However, Ganesh Vasudeo Tagare in the Introduction to vol. 1 of his English
translation of *The Bh**?gavata-**pur??a* (1976, p. xxxvi) points out
that a *Pur??a
**Bh?gavata* is named in the Jaina text, *Nand**?-s**?tra*. Since this
Jaina text can be dated around 500 C.E., some version of the *Bh**?gavata-*
*pur??a* existed then. This is in his section, "The Date and Authorship of
the Bh.P.," pp. xxxiv-xlii. He begins this section by listing thirteen
proposed dates for the *Bh**?gavata-**pur??a*, ranging from 1200 B.C. to
1300 A.D., and their sources. Included here is the date proposed by
pur??a specialist R. C. Hazra, author of the 1940 classic work, *Studies in
the Pur**?nic Records on Hindu Rites and Customs*, as 600 A.D.
