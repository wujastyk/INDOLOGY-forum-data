[INDOLOGY] Tukaram and the name Tuka
When Sanskrit words are borrowed into Tamil, the cluster -kra- can sometimes be simplified as -kka-. See Tamil Lexicon entry below:
????????? cakkav?lar, n. < cakrav?la. Devas residing in Mt. Cakkarav??a; ???????? ????????????????? ??????? ????????. (???????. 574.)
As for ?- > t-, we have the possible case of ?r? > Tiru. But, I do not know of any word Ta. tukka <  Skt. ?ukra per se. 
On the other hand, we have Skt. Durg? > Ta. Tukkai as in the Tamil Lexicon entry below.
??????? tukkai, n. < Durg?. Durg?; ????????. ??????????? ???????????. (S. I. I. i, 91).
Is it possible the name of the goddess was a similar Dravidianized form of Skt. Durg?, which was later re-interpreted as Tuk?i? It will be interesting to know how Kannada naturalized ?Durg??.
