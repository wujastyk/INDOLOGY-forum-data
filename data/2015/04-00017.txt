Subject: [INDOLOGY] Tukaram and the name Tuka

When Sanskrit words are borrowed into Tamil, the cluster -kra- can sometimes be simplified as -kka-. See Tamil Lexicon entry below:
????????? cakkav?lar, n. < cakrav?la. Devas residing in Mt. Cakkarav??a; ???????? ????????????????? ??????? ????????. (???????. 574.)

As for ?- > t-, we have the possible case of ?r? > Tiru. But, I do not know of any word Ta. tukka <  Skt. ?ukra per se. 

On the other hand, we have Skt. Durg? > Ta. Tukkai as in the Tamil Lexicon entry below.

??????? tukkai, n. < Durg?. Durg?; ????????. ??????????? ???????????. (S. I. I. i, 91).

Is it possible the name of the goddess was a similar Dravidianized form of Skt. Durg?, which was later re-interpreted as Tuk?i? It will be interesting to know how Kannada naturalized ?Durg??.

I find it prompts two more questions: first, whether Tuk? was a common name before the time of Tuk?r?m, or whether people bearing the name today are largely named after him. (Or perhaps after the goddess -- is it a name used by both sexes?) And second, whether any Dravidian scholar on the list can confirm or deny the development ?ukra > tukka (in one or more Dravidian languages -- I'm not sure the same sound laws apply everywhere).

>> Tuk?/Tuk?r?m is still a common personal name in Marathi.  While the origin of the name Tuk? is not quite clear, there is a popular goddess in Maharashtra named Tu?j? Bhav?n?, also known as Tuk?i (Tuk? + ?i), where "?i" is the Marathi word for mother, and the first part "Tuk?" in her name is explained traditionally as being made up of "tu" (you) + "k?" (why), and there is a story saying someone asked this goddess "why did you come, O Mother", which gave her the name Tuk?i. Another explanation I have heard is that "tukka" is the Dravidian form of Sanskrit ?ukra, and since Friday (?ukrav?ra) is auspicious for this goddess, she came to be known as Tukk?i. While this may not be a true historical explanation of the name Tuk?i, the name of this goddess may have made the name Tuk? popular in Maharashtra.
