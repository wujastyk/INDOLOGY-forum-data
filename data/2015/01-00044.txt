On pp. 7-8 of hispaper, Ganesan says, "In EastIndia (Nepali, Bihari, Bengali) (3) nakar is the name of gharial [13],directly derivable from the Tamil verb, nakar- ???to creep, to crawlslowly???. Compared to muggers (< makara), gharials have muchsmaller, weak legs and cannot do ???high walk??? as muggers can (Figures 7, 8).When gharials come to the shore for sun bathing orfor laying eggs, they creep on the banks awkwardly pushing their huge bodiesforward. From this Dravidian nakar, Sanskrit gets nakra-/n??kra- andMiddle Indo-Aryan nakka-. In Tamil Tevaram texts, ??iva is called nakkar/nakka???due to his nudity traceable to the phallusshape of the gharial snout and its ancient name."
While Ganesaneasily moves from Tamil nakar to Dravidian nakar, DEDR does notinclude an entry that includes Tamil nakar 'to creep, to crawl slowly'. Thereseem to be no cognates of nakar in any other Dravidian language including Teluguand Kannada. (nakar is not included in Emeneau and Burrow's  "DravidianBorrowings from Indo-Aryan" either.) So Tamil nakar 'to creep slowly, crawl slowly' being the source ofIndo-Aryan nakra/n??kra is not very convincingto me.  As a result,tracing nakkar/nakka??? (referring to ??iva) "to the phallusshape of the gharial snout and its ancient name" also seems to beimpossible.
However, thereis another possibility, as Burrow and Emeneau seem to think.
DEDR 3732 entryis given below.
3732 Ka.negar??, negar??e alligator. Tu. nega????? id.; negar?? asea-animal, the vehicle of Varu???a. Te. (B.) nega???u apolypus or marine animal supposed to entangle swimmers. / Cf. Skt. nakra-crocodile; n??kra- a kind of aquatic animal; Turner, CDIAL, no.7038. 
Based on DEDR3732 Krishnamurti has given a reconstructed form *nek-V??????? (Dravidian Languages, 2003, p. 13). This word atleast could be transmitted to Indo-Aryan since Kannada is adjacent toIndo-Aryan linguistic areas. 
Etymology ofTamil i???a??
kar
As best as Icould figure out Ganesan's chain of reasoning, this is how Ganesan seems toarrive at how Tamil words vi???a??
kar/i???a??
kar are interpreted as referring togharial.
 ??iva is naked as Bhik????????ana. 
 Gharial's snout has the shape of aphallus.
 Gharial is called nakka in MiddleIndo-Aryan
 So ??iva is called nakkar becausehe is naked.
 Tamil vi???a??
ku means 'to beerect (as lingam)' (Ganesan's own interpretation)
 ??iva is called vi???a??
kar.
 So vi???a??
kar stands for the male organ. 
 Gharial's snout has the shape of aphallus. 
 So vi???a??
karin Tamil means gharial. 
According toGanesan, vi???a??
kar lost the initial v- and became i???a??
kar. 
The word vi???a??
karreferring to a crocodile occurs for the first time in the Varatar??ca Aiya??
k??r P??kavatam,a 16th century text. Earlier literary texts or lexicons do not mention thatword. But earlier texts going back to 2nd century CE mention i???a??
kar inthe sense of 'crocodile'.  In several instances in the Kampar??m??ya???am (ca.9th or 12th century), i???a??
kar is the word used to describe the crocodilethat attacked the elephant in the Gajendra Mok???a episode. (For example, see Kampar???????ya???am5.12.79.3.)
(In fact,contrary to Ganesan???s suggestion of vi???a??
karbeing the original form, which lost v-to result in i???a??
kar, I would arguethat the original form was indeed i???a??
karand the form vi???a??
kar probablyresulted from a reanalysis of a manuscript line such as tuyi??????a???avi???a??
karm??tta???a??
ka????????um?? in Kampar??m??ya???am Kitkint?? K????????amK??rk??lappa???alam published in 1862 as shown in Attachment 2, where ???v- is a glide resulting from themorphophonemics of joining tuyi??????a???aending in -a and i???a??
kar beginning in i-.When the words in the quoted line are separated, the word in question is takenas i???ankar as can be seen in http://tinyurl.com/kd756qp .)
Even if oneaccepts the form vi???a??
kar to beearlier, in the 16th century text, the word 'vi???a??
kar' is used inconnection with crocodile-elephant encounter. Since gharials are not known toattack even human beings  (http://crocodilian.com/cnhc/csp_ggan.htm), it is doubtful if they are biologicallyequipped to attack big elephants.   Even in the Ma???im??kalai (6th century CE), themoat around K????nci wasdescribed as having crocodiles indicated by the term i???a??
kar, whichmeans that i???a??
kar cannot be identified as gharial.  (As gharials do not attack human beings, they would not have beenused in moats, which were designed to ward off attacks by hostile warriors.) So the case of vi???a??
kar/i???a??
karrepresenting gharial is not defensible.
Conclusions
In my opinion, Ganesan'setymologies for Sanskrit makara and nakra/n??kra are not supportedby comparative Dravidian linguistic evidence or Tamil philology. Also, hisetymological interpretation of Tamil vi???a??
kar/i???a??
kar is not supportedby Tamil philology. 
In January 2012 Ganesanstated that the article had been published in "Prof. V. I. Subramoniumcommemoration volume, ISDL, Tiruvananthapuram, Kerala, 2011". Later, inFebruary 2013 he stated that the article had been published in "Prof. V.I. Subramonian Memorial Volume, International School of Dravidian Linguistics,2011, (Tiruvananthapuram, Kerala)". International Journal of DravidianLinguistics, Volume 39, Issue 2 published in June 2010 was called"PROFESSOR V. I. SUBRAMONIAM MEMORIAL VOLUME" as can be seen in Attachment3. Ganesan's article was not included in that volume. Nor was it published inthe IJDL issues of 2011. There was no commemoration volume published by ISDL in2011. 
However, thereis going to be a separate Professor V. I. Subramoniam Commemoration Volume thatwill be published in June 2015 during the 43rd annual conference of DravidianLinguistics Association to be held in Annamalai University in Tamil Nadu. (Forconference details, see http://www.ijdl.org/Html/announcement_43.pdf.) Ganesan???s article might beincluded in Professor V. I. Subramoniam Commemoration Volume.
I wouldappreciate any comments from the list members.
Thank you inadvance.
