[INDOLOGY] Tukaram and the name Tuka
1. Suresh, why do you consider DEDR's including star as a meaning in the
entry for cukka wrong? Do you think, cukka=star is a tadbhava coming from
s'ukla=white, ( also?bright?) and not a dEs'ya. Is cukka=star as a
laakshaNika (metaphorical) extension from cukka=dot not convincing?
2. There are other uses of chukka covered in Gwynn's dictionary :
cukka
*cukka* *n*. *1* point, dot, spot. *2* drop. *3* star; *eemiTi ~
uuDipaDDaTTu waccEEwu*? why have you come like a star falling? i.e., why
have you come unexpectedly out of the blue? *4* the planet Venus, whose
appearance in front of a traveller starting on a journey is considered
unlucky; *~ tirigindi* *lit*. the star has turned, i.e., Venus is no longer
in front and the auspicious time has begun; *cf*. *cukkeduru*. *5**
beautiful woman. 6 alcohol, liquor*. (underlining mine)
DEDR does not cover these meanings. Are these cukka=beautiful woman and
cukka= alcohol, liquor dEs'ya are not?
 Is cukka = beautiful woman a laakshaNika (metaphorical) extension from
cukka=star?
s'ukra in astrology considered to be a planet affecting arts, beauty and
aesthetics; Is it related to that?
Is cukka =liquor a laakshaNika (metaphorical) extension from cukka=
drop? or is it related to the milky white colour (s'ukla) of  country
liquor?
3. If cukka=star is accepted as a dEs'ya, cukka=planet venus can be linked
to that as a coincidental cultural similarity to expressions such as
morning star.
These are some aspects to ponder over in this connection.
