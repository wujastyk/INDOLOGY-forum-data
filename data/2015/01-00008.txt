Dear members of the Indology list,

I am in Mumbai nowadays and have been in Pune recently, and I am wondering if it is still possible to obtain copies of Sanskrit manuscripts in India. The Asiatic Society is now asking 5000 rps for photographying one page of a Ms. That is approximately 70 Euros and I doubt any European library is asking such an amount. In some German libraries, recently, I could take photos for free. On the other hand, other Indian places are much cheaper, but the work must be made by the staff and sometimes it is simply not done. By instance, I have ordered copies of Mss. at the BORI, Pune, in 2013 and I am still waiting for some, even though I have visited Pune two weeks ago and asked Mr Bapat to complete the work as soon as possible. I am phoning him every day and he promises, but nothing comes out. I suppose some of you have experienced the same.

Best regards,

J.M.Delire, Lecturer on Science and Civilization of India, University of Brussels
