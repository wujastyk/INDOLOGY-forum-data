[INDOLOGY] Characteristics of Fools
Interesting observation by Ashok Aklujkar, and thanks.
So ? may I take it that the word ?Mu?rkha? or ?muurkha? to render the meaning ?fool??
In Tamil we have a saying ? ?m?rkka?um mutalaiyum ko??atu vi??? (?m?rkka? and crocodile won?t let their catch go?) implying the stubbornness in both species (man and animal). 
So, ?m?rkka?? is a nominal form derived from  ?Mu?rkha? or ?muurkha????
