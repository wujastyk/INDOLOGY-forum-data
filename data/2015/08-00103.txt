Great. Congratulations. A welcome and needed work. Will a digital, searchable and or online version become available? I find paper dictionaries are cumbersome for travel. Also the "buy now" button on the link did not function for me.

Best,
B. Fleming

With apologies for cross posting. This is a new book edited by me and Mark McClish and David Brick. It is a Sanskrit Dictionary of Indian Law and Statecraft, with words, their meaning(s), and a selection of passages in which the words occur. You can see it at:

With best wishes,
