=?utf-8?Q?Regarding_a_possible_etymology_of_the_name_Ghera=E1=B9=87=E1=B8=8Da?=
Dear all,
My access to Indian languages is not so great (besides some Sanskrit & Bengali), so I couldn't figure out any etymology for the name of Ghera??a (??????).
Any suggestion will be much appreciated.
Many thanks and all the bestfrom Bucharest,
