[INDOLOGY] Satire in Sanskrit literature and philosophy?
1. ARE THERE ANY OTHER STRONG (extensive) EXAMPLES?
Three Satires
by Nilakantha, Kshemendra and Bhallata
Bhallata is an addition to the discussion here:
Intro says: Bh?llata the disgruntled court poet speaks of a setting sun
(his former king and patron Av?nti?varma) being replaced by a flickering
firefly (the new king Sh?nkara?deva, who did not continue his predecessor?s
patronage).
2. Satire in Indian literature? WHAT is usually criticized?

3. Satire in Indian philosophy? Criticism of WHAT?
There are satires on different schools of Vedic and non-Vedic philosophy on
different schools of Vedanta.
Gajam mithyaa Palaayanam mithyaa is an example. There is a Satire on
Advaita and a counter-satire to it here.
