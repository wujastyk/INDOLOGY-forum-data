> My good old friend Dr. Dominik Wujastyk has directed me to you. I am writing this with a request to give a due publicity to the announcement of a Avestan class that will be conducted at the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Pune from July 6 - 17, 2015. This is not a profit making activity and is being conducted on an experimental basis for the first time at the Institute. I hope you will do the needful and help us give wider publicity to this class.
