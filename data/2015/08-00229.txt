Dear All,
Is there a chance of finding a list member able and willing to share the paper
KALASURIYA, A. S.

That is the reference I have, though, technically speaking, the journal appeared between 1972 and 1986/87 (New Series, Vols.16?31) as Journal of the Sri Lanka Branch of the RAS.
I would be very grafeful for your generous assistance in locating the article or at least supplying an e-mail address of the present Royal Asiatic Society of Sri Lanka, Colombo .
