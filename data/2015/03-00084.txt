[INDOLOGY] Lance Cousins
What a huge loss to scholarship, and a sad and unexpected passing of a much
loved and valued colleague.  Many years ago, Lance graciously allowed
his review
article <http://indology.info/papers/cousins/> about the debate surrounding
the date of the Buddha to be published on the INDOLOGY website, where it
has been read hundreds if not thousands of times.  Lance's writings on the
history of Buddhism and Buddhist meditation practices are invaluable (and I
use them routinely in my teaching).
Sincerely,
Dominik Wujastyk
