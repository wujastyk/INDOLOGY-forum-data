Subject: [INDOLOGY] A course on "The Word and the World" or ancient Indian	analytic philosophy
Message-ID: <59EE49C0-7604-4463-A66B-CBE3242DB52A@gmail.com>

The enrolment limit for the course about which I circulated information earlier has been increased by 15. Applications will be accepted until 05 July. 

I would greatly appreciate your help in giving publicity to the availability of the course and the new enrolment limit and deadline. 

Thanks.
