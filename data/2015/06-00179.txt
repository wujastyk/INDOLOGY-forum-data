[INDOLOGY] A course on "The Word and the World" or ancient Indian	analytic philosophy
The enrolment limit for the course about which I circulated information earlier has been increased by 15. Applications will be accepted until 05 July. 
I would greatly appreciate your help in giving publicity to the availability of the course and the new enrolment limit and deadline. 
Thanks.
