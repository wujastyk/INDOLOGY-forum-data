[INDOLOGY] krauYcapadA
Dear colleagues,
I am very grateful for your help.
Roland, I had checked Velankar's "Prosodial Practice" thanks to an earlier
pointer from Andrew. I'm glad to know that that is also the article you
would consult.
I did not know about the caesurae that aren't (always) noted as yatis in
the metrical treatises. Thank you both for pointing those out to me!
D?niel, it would be interesting to compare the number of compound
boundaries vs. word boundaries at the yatis (e.g. 42 vs. 458) with the
total number of compound boundaries vs. word boundaries in the verses
you've studied. That might give us a rough idea of their relative
acceptability. I'll look forward to the English version of your paper.
Best wishes,
Dieter
