Subject: [INDOLOGY] Sanskrit speaking villages in Andra Pradesh
Message-ID: <CAJGj9eaDcHoHYSzJ3iOSh60a37o0w8jngfTsbJUn3OV=KFnpQg@mail.gmail.com>

The article does not mention names of any Sanskrit speaking villages in
Andhra Pradesh.

It even says, "In recent times, the popularity of Sanskrit has increased in
the North and some parts of the South, except in Andhra Pradesh"

Even the Muslims of Mattur converse in Sanskrit.Mattur, a village close to
Shimoga in Karnataka.

So, "In Andhra Pradesh too there are a few villages where Muslims speak
Sanskrit. "  can be taken to mean that some Muslims in some villages of
Andhra Pradesh  are so much  learned in Sanskrit, that they can even speak
Sanskrit.

To my knowledge, there are no Sanskrit speaking villages either in the
present residual Andhra Pradesh or earlier undivided Andhra Pradesh.
