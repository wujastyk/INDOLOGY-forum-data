[INDOLOGY] Literature on western reception of Hinduism
With apologies for cross-posting, and for being unable to locate earlier 
posts on similar topics in the archives:
Can anyone suggest a suitable book (or several), suitable for 
undergraduates, specifically on the reception of Hinduism in the west, 
including but not limited to new religious movements? (Please mentally 
insert quotation marks around any or all of these terms as desired.)
Many thanks in advance,
