[INDOLOGY] New Issues of E-Journal of Vedic Studies
Yes, Indeed, Harry!  Sorry: the server has developed a problem that can be fixed only after New Year.
In the meantime please use the Heidelberg server, where Frits Staal?s paper and another one will be uploaded now.
Incidentally, a commemoration volume for Frits is in the works and should appear sometime in 2016.
