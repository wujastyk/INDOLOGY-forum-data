[INDOLOGY] Tithi & synodic month
Dear Colleagues,
Is there any evidence for the use of the fraction 63/64  ? to determine the
length of the lunar day (tithi)? In ancient Babylonian-Greek astronomy? In
ancient Indian astronomy?
The result of the division, if multiplied by 30, would give the length of
the synodic month  ? as 29. 53125d.
Your help in the matter would be greatly appreciated,
