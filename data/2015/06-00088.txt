[INDOLOGY] The so-called German Indology
I have not read the book, only about 15 pages from what Amazon lets us see.  It seems obvious to me that the book needs to be taken seriously.  If scholars disagree vehemently with its method and conclusions, I hope they will read it and write a review.  My own impression (based on just a few pages) is that the book helps give perspective to the ?science? of Indology ? how it developed, what social and historical forces guided it, and perhaps some assumptions of modern scholars that are problematic.  I remember spending a year poring over Geldner, Grassman, and Oldenberg and being very impressed by their scholarship.  The accomplishments of German Indologists are clearly seminal, but that doesn?t mean it?s not important to understand the intellectual, cultural and historical circumstances that inevitably influenced what they wrote.
