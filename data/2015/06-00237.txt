One odd thing: the animal in the video does indeed appear to be a rabbit, as distinct from a hare. I thought that rabbits were not native to India, and that the word ?a?a referred to a hare (the words ?hare? and ??a?a' probably being cognates). Of course, they may well behave in the same way when their young are threatened, but they are different species.
