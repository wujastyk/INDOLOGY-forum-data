[INDOLOGY] Pramanyavada [with commentaries by Gadadhara and	Venimadhava]
Many thanks to Rohana Seneviratne for pointing me to the DLI holding.
Unfortunately, the DLI scan is of poor quality, cutting out the last few
lines of many of the pages.
If anyone has a better scan, I'd very much appreciate it.
Thanks,
Sam
