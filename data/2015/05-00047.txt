[INDOLOGY] query [regarding the correct version of a defectively cited verse]
Dear Ashok,
I think we'll just have to agree to disagree on what is likely. N?s?v 
??ir yasya mata? na bhinnam, :-) and there are many elements that may go 
into an emendation. To me, the verse in question does indeed seem rather 
clich?-like, making  the formulaic y?vac candraprabh?karau appear more 
likely than it does to you. But of course I may be wrong.
