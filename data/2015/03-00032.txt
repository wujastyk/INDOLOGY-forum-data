Message-ID: <CAKdt-CdtK4Yj+n45dZ_HyNO7Ar1q=kioD008r_G4=srvVbzAZg@mail.gmail.com>

In the 1945 Nir?ayas?gara Press edition of the Su?rutasa?hita,
<https://archive.org/details/sushrutasamhita> the page before the upodgh?ta
states that the editor N?r?ya?a R?ma had sight of an old palm-leaf MS of
the SS that was in the collection of Y. T. ?c?rya.

Does anyone know anything about YTA's manuscript collection?  Was it merged
into one of the Bombay collections?  Are members of his family still alive?

Best,
Dominik Wujastyk
