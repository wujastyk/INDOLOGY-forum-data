[INDOLOGY] New Issues of E-Journal of Vedic Studies
Dear Michael,
Thank you for this news.  I'm delighted to see the EJVS at it's new home
<http://crossasia-journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/ejvs/index> at
Heidelberg, with a smart new presentation through the OJS interface.  And
each article with a DOI.  These are all important ways for the rest of us
to get easier and more effective access to the materials in EJVS.  Thank
you!
Best,
Dominik
