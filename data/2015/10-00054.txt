Subject: [INDOLOGY] vizeSa as 'special rule'?

Yes, of course. These are not instances of vi?e?a as the latter part of 
a compound, etc. Here are a few examples, all of which are followed in 
the text by quotations from other works:

    atra r?trijanman???ak?layoge vi?e?a uktas t?jik?la?k?re |

    atra vi?e?a ukto d?pik?y?m |

    anyo ?pi vi?e?as tatraiva |

    atha dhanar?e lagn?nayane vi?e?a? |

    atr?ntakara?e vi?e?a ukta? paddhatau |

Such instances are very numerous. There is also the following, where 
'particular method' might fit better than 'special rule':

    eva? sakalaga?akas?rvabhauma?r?madr?madaivaj??ptavidyair m?d??air
    aneke vi?e??? kartu? ?akyante |


I anyone has matching examples from other contexts, I'd be very 
interested to see them.
