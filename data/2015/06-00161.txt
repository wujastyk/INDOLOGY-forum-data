[INDOLOGY] prof. or mr. or mrs. or ms. etc first name
My understanding of the British Lord/Lady thing is that the new Lord gets
to choose his "name."  So Mr Jeff Bloggs, on elevation, could choose to be
"Lord Semster of Netherwallop" or whatever he liked.  Usually such names
are related to birthplace, political constituency, or something like that.
