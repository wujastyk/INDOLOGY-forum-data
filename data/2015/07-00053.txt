[INDOLOGY] Tigers and Goats: A quick report on the World Sanskrit Conference, Bangkok 2015
Dear McComas,
Thanks for this quick and, I think, quite appropriate report.
I would take exception to two formulations: neither Indology nor
linguistics and other major relevant disciplines are in a universally
accepted progressive research programme, but perhaps you did not intend it
that way:
in THE broader theoretical or academic context >>> in A broader theoretical
or academic context (to be specified)
how it contributes to THE big picture >>> how it contributes to A LARGER
picture
Regarding your last point (nice prospect):
as you explained in your Sanskrit interview in Bangkok that Australia is
nowadays full of sanskrit-, yoga- and other teachers,
I would like to ask in an ardha?loka:
??????????????????? ????????????????? ?
Best, Jan
