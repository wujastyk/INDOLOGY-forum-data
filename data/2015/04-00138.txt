[INDOLOGY] epigraphia indica vol- 40 and Wada Inscription of	Suketuvarman
?Is epigraphia indica vol- 40 available as pdf? I am also searching for
Srinivasan, P.R., "Bhoja Suketuvarman's inscription of Saka 328 in the
Prince of Wales Museum", in Journal of Indian History, vol. 57, no. 1?.This
inscription is also known as Wada Inscription of Suketuvaran. It was also
published by K V Ramesh. However I don't have necessary details.  If any
group member has the same please share.
regards
Rupali Mokashi
