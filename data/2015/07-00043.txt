When a question relating to a ?a?kara-vijaya came up here recently, I did a
quick online search and found that very few of these biographies of
?a?kar?c?rya were available on the web. So I have now scanned the ones I
had and posted them, along with three scanned by others, with the Sanskrit
Hindu texts at
http://prajnaquest.fr/blog/sanskrit-texts-3/sanskrit-hindu-texts/. Besides
the two well-known ones by Anant?nandagiri and by M?dhava, and also the one
by Vy?s?cala, these include seven edited by W. R. Antarkar.


Antarkar had made a comprehensive study of all the available
?a?kara-vijayas, both in print and in manuscript (then sixteen in total),
for his 1960 University of Poona PhD thesis: ?a?kara-vijayas: A Comparative
and a Critical Study. In subsequent years he published several journal
articles pertaining to this topic, and editions of seven lesser-known
?a?kara-vijayas (hopefully I did not miss any when I gathered them about
fifteen years ago). But his thesis remained unpublished.


A few days ago by chance I saw that Antarkar?s thesis has been published,
and this was back in 2003! This book is even now not listed on WorldCat,
which only shows the 1960 thesis (and that is held only at one library). A
scan of this book, in two parts (the thesis, and later articles as
appendices), is available at:
https://sites.google.com/site/hindulibrary/document-list


<https://sites.google.com/site/hindulibrary/document-list>

In view of the disputes around the ?a?kara ma?has that we were just
reminded of by Dean?s post, it may be worth noting that this book is
scholarly research with no connection to any ma?ha, contrary to
appearances. As may be seen by the photos of the adhipatis of the Kanchi
Kamakoti ?a?kara ma?ha in its opening pages, this book was published by an
affiliate of this ma?ha. I am very grateful to everyone involved in the
publication of Antarkar?s thesis for making it available at long last.


The extant ?a?kara-vijayas are comparatively late, and their stories often
conflict with each other. One of the latest (nineteenth century) was
published in Germany in 1992: *?a?kara-mand?ra-saurabha: Eine Legende ?ber
das Leben des Philosophen ?a?kara, *Text, ?bersetzung, Einleitung, by Anton
Ungemach. Antarkar showed in separate articles that the extant
?a?kara-vijaya attributed to ?nandagiri (1961 article
<http://easterntradition.org/antarkar%202.pdf>) and the one attributed to
Vidy?ra?ya (1972article <http://easterntradition.org/antarkar%203.pdf>) are
later works, not written by those authors. Antarkar commented at the end of
his 1961 article: ?not one of the 16/17 biographies of ?a?kara I have
worked upon inspires confidence in its authenticity to the expected
degree.? However, Antarkar provided good evidence that two old
?a?kara-vijayas still existed in the recent past: B?hat-?a?kara-vijaya by
Citsukha and Pr?c?na-?a?kara-vijaya by ?nandagiri (1960 article
<http://easterntradition.org/antarkar%201.pdf>). Despite his efforts, he
could not obtain them, and these have still not come to light as far as I
know.
