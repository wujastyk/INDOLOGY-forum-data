[INDOLOGY] INDOLOGY Digest, Vol 33,	Issue 16-Questions about Malayalam
Dear Professor Hock,
thanks to the Gundert-Chair for Malayalam here in T?bingen, I can offer the answer of a native speaker; in fact Professor Scaria Zacharia is here as Gundert-Chair Professor.
According to him, 
1-Sanjay vannu Mariam-um vannu
 and Sanjay-um vannu Mariam-um vannu have the same meaning. There is no implication of one being expected and the other not.
2- "??-um alla pe??-um alla" he translated as ?it is neither male nor female? and it would be grammatically acceptable in Malayalam
All the best
Elena Mucciarelli
