[INDOLOGY] Favour?
Dear list members,
I have before me a Sanskrit manuscript bearing the title Bhagavadg?t?m?l?ma?trasya. Can someone with easy access to the New Catalogus Catalogorum please tell me whether it mentions other manuscripts of this text and, if so, perhaps, provide me with a scan of the relevant information. Thanks a lot!
