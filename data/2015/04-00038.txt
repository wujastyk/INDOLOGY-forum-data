[INDOLOGY] Tukaram and the name Tuka
Many thanks to all who contributed to this discussion. To sum up, 
Tuka/Tukka may well be a Marathi name (many notable astrological authors 
from this period were from Maharashtra) and may or may not be related to 
the name of the goddess Tuk? (whose name in turn may be a Dravidized 
form of Durg?). The suggestion Tuka < Turu?ka is noted, too, but the 
author in question wrote at least one scholarly work in Sanskrit verse, 
which seems to make a Muslim background unlikely (though not completely 
unheard of).
