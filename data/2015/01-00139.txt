Ganesan sent a message on the *ctamil *list asking me to elaborate on why I
think his etymologies are fanciful. Since his questions were limited to the
etymologies proposed for the words *vi?a?kar *and *i?a?kar**, *I will limit
my response to his assertions on these words. The following excerpts from
his paper discusses the word *vi?a?kar:*
The god ?iva in Tamil bhakti texts of the first millennium, is extolled as
either nakkar or vi?a?kar indicating ?iva?s nudity and his virile lingam in
particular. [page 4].

The last and very important Tamil name for gharial is vi?a?kar/i?a?kar. In
old Tamil texts, vi?ai refers to the virile male of animals - bovids,
caprids, antelopes, elephants. It is a verbal noun from vi?ai- 'to enlarge,
to thicken, to stiffen up, to stand with pride?. In the Marutam landscape,
the rich landlord enjoying prostitutes is called as vi?alai, vi?a?. In
Tamil, vi?ai- > vi?a?ku- "to be erect (as lingam), male beauty,
masculinity, virility, fertile." Compare vi?ai:vi?a?ku with verb pairs like
(i) ma?ai: ma?a?ku ?water embankment, to block?, (ii) ki?ai: ki?a?ku
?animal shed, godown?, (iii) malai:mala?ku ?to be confused?, (iv) tirai:
tira?ku ?screen?, (v) i?ai: i?a?ku ?to join?, (vi) picai: pica?ku ?to
knead? etc., ?iva is called in Tamil bhakti poems like Tevaram as vi?a?kar,
and a lingam (usually emerald) is kept near Somaskanda in vi?a?kar temples
which is worshipped with reverence as vi?a?kar [15]. vi?a?kar, standing for
either male organ (lingam) or gharial snout, gives rise to Tamil names for
gharial, vi?a?kar (> i?a?kar). This word is borrowed into Sanskrit as a
loan from Dravidian: vi?ha?ka ? person of dissolute habits, voluptuary?
(Cf. vi?alai in Sangam poems). In Tamil, i?akkar ?indecent words; terms
denoting things or actions too obscene to be uttered in good society?;
i?akkar-a?akkal ? euphemism to use indirect expressions to avoid words
relating to sex?, i?akkar:i?a?kar ?pot? obviously from the protuberance on
the male gharial snout, i?a?kar ?narrow path? are derivable from vi?a?kar
with the loss of word-initial v-. [page 7].
I can almost label every sentence in the above excerpts as questionable.
Let us examine them one by one:
The god ?iva in Tamil bhakti texts of the first millennium, is extolled as
either nakkar or vi?a?kar indicating ?iva?s nudity and his virile lingam in
particular.
1. In Ganesan's entire paper, he has not referred to the DEDR entry
for *vi?a?kar
*and he hasn't attempted to prove or disprove why the meaning of 'beauty'
found in various Dravidian languages under this entry is incorrect. Since
*nakkar* means nude, he asserts *vi?a?kar* must also indicate nudity. Here
is DEDR entry 5472:

He lists Rajeshwari Ghose's work on the Tyagaraja Cult in the references,
but he doesn't refer to or disucss her conclusions on the word *vi?a?kar. * On
page 35, Ghose concludes: "a) The term V*i?a?kar *was used by several
