[INDOLOGY] meaning of cungi sanskrit
Dear Colleagues, 
Would anyone know what "cungi sanskrit" refers to ? I am finding the name of a pandit of Shajahanpura who in the 1870s is said to have taught "cungi sanskrit" in the local pathshala. "Cungi" means tax or toll in hindi. But what could "fiscal sanskrit" mean?! A sort of commercial use of the language ? 
Best, 
Catherine Cl?mentin-Ojha
