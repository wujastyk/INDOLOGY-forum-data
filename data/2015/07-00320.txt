Hermann Gundert was the grandfather of 20th century novelist Hermann Hesse and is considered one of Germany?s greatest linguists in the field of South Indian languages. Gundert studied Theology in T?bingen and learned Sanskrit. He completed his doctorate in T?bingen in 1835. From 1838, he worked for the Basel Mission in Nettur in southwestern India, where Malayalam is spoken. There he founded a school, translated from Malayalam into German, and translated the New Testament into Malayalam. He left India in 1859 due to illness. His most important works in Malayalam were therefore completed in the southwestern German town of Calw, and include the hymn book and his Malayalam-English dictionary, which remains in print today.

Gundert has been called ?the Luther of Kerala.? His translation of the Bible is still used there. His dictionary and grammar remain standard works. His legacy to the T?bingen University Library contains unique material for linguists and indologists. The University of T?bingen is known as Gundert?s University in Kerala - one more reason for the Malayalam University to enter into a partnership with T?bingen on the occasion of Gundert?s 200th birthday.
 
The University of T?bingen has been one of Germany?s main centers of India studies since the mid-19th century, based on the work of Rudolf von Roth, who contributed to the new Veda research, and for whom T?bingen established a Chair of Sanskrit in 1856. T?bingen also sent a number of missionaries to India in the 19th century; their pastoral and academic work strengthened ties between T?bingen and Kerala.
