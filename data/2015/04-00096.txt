[INDOLOGY] Eight types of marriages ...
Many thanks to all the members for sending me useful information about the ?eight types of marriages? in non-Tamil texts. 
I think I need to read and search further. 
I?m looking for what exactly is ?taught? to the bride at the wedding. 
The Tamil word ?kaRpu; ka?pu; ?????? is normally understood to mean ?chastity; marital fidelity? and is invariably associated with women. 
Unfortunately (?) / Truthfully (!), this word (?kaRpu; ka?pu; ??????) is NOT restricted to women as we know from ancient Tamil literature. The semantics of the word ?kaRpu; ka?pu; ?????)? is ?learning/maturing.? kaRpu < kal ?to mature, learn."
So, naturally I want to know what the bride was ?told? to ?learn? during the wedding ceremony. Was the bridegroom ?told/taught? to be ?chaste?? 
[I wish I had the opportunity to learn Sanskrit when I was growing up in South India and had the capability to understand what was chanted during my wedding ceremony. I don?t think even my husband understood what was recited by the ?prohit/priest? and he was asked to repeat!]
When I gather relevant information for my quest and manage to write an article comparing the Tamil and non-Tamil perspectives, I?d like to send it to interested scholars for feedback.
Thanks and regards,
V.S.Rajam
