[INDOLOGY] Malhotra and plagiarism
No one has asked for a ban. The demand has been for a public
acknowledgement, apology, and withdrawal of his plagiarized books from the
market. He would be welcome to reissue corrected versions, if either his
publishers or readers were keen on that. This is very distinct from calling
for a ban. Malhotra is a wealthy and influential man who has both stolen
from and disrespected a talented young scholar (known chiefly for the
pioneering work on Indian Philosophy Malhotra stole from). There is a
massive wealth and power differential between these two figures. Malhotra's
actions are very Indian ruling class, i.e. Lumpenbourgoisie, acting as if
laws don't apply to him esp. in his interactions with lesser beings.
Comparing the number of signatures in the Doniger case vs. the  Andrew
Nicholson case is not helpful. Again Andrew is a talented younger scholar,
known chiefly for his pioneering work. Wendy Doniger is an institution unto
herself, a very senior scholar, obviously slightly more famous and
connected than Andrew.  224 signatures is not a low number. It shows that
more than two hundred people want to see Malhotra exposed for his lack of
intellectual integrity, recently materialized in the vulgarest possible
way. This is not pettiness. Malhotra made a serious violation, and he
should have to answer for it.
Silence would only condone.  Here is a link to the petition again for
others who may not have seen it:
