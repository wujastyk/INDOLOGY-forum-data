I looked briefly at the Tibetan translation (sde dge) of ?ubhagupta's 
BASK, but could not find any statement there that might be a (indirect) 
source of the quotation. But Serena Saccone, who wrote her dissertation 
on the BASK (I believe forthcoming with Motilal), would be the best 
person to ask.
In their "Buddhist Philosophy of Language in India" (Columbia Univ. 
Press 2010), McCrea and Patil mention that Abhinavagupta records 
Dharmottara as the author of a text entitled B?hy?rthasiddhi, but "this 
text is not referred to elsewhere, as far as we know, and its existence 
seems to have passed unnoticed in contemporary secondary literature" (p. 
143, n. 71, available on Google Books). They say references are  found 
in ?PVV vol. 2, 128, 394.
It is also possible that "b?hy?rthasiddhi" is a descriptive title 
referring to some part of a work, and the passage referring to the 
?juvimal? might be construed as "and this was refuted in the ?juvimal? 
in [the section dealing with] the proof of external objects".
For a further understanding of how ??likan?tha makes use of 
Dharmak?rtian notions in his theory of cognition (especially 
?k?ra/svasa?vedana, where the concept of prak??a is pertinent), it may 
be helpful to look at Taiken KYUMA's "??likan?tha's Criticism of 
Dharmak?rti's svasa?vedana theory", JIP 38 (2010) 247-259.
