[INDOLOGY] vizeSa as 'special rule'?
Balabhadra in his astrological work /H?yanaratna/ repeatedly makes use 
of the noun /vi?e?a/ in a sense which seems from the context to mean 
something like 'special rule' or 'particular consideration'. I haven't 
found this precise meaning in any dictionary and am curious to know if 
the term occurs with this technical meaning in any other ??stras.
