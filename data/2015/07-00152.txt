Since the topic has come up, it is illuminating as David and Nancy have done, to look beyond the wretched and ignorant writings of Mr. Malhotra to examples of work in wide circulation in which the author?s unethical reliance on earlier scholarship has not been widely noticed.
The most serious and extensive example we have  encountered in the course of our work is Hari Prasad Shastri?s three volume English translation of the V?lm?kir?m?ya?a, The Ramayana of Valmiki (London: Shanti Sadan 1959). This work has been very substantially translated directly from Alfred Roussel?s 1903 French translation Le R?m?ya?a de V?lm?ki, (Paris: Librairie des cinq parties du monde. Biblioth?que Orientale, no. 8.) as Sally Sutherland Goldman and I have amply documented throughout  the annotation of our translations of the epic?s Sundara, Yuddha and Uttara (now in press) k???as.
As others have noted Sanskrit does  of course have a widely used marker of quotations in the form of the particle iti and the numerous authors with whom we have worked are quite meticulous in citing their sources whether they agree or disagree with the quoted authors or texts. They do not necessarily cite, as  modern western protocol requires, by chapter and verse, generally being content with ascriptions to a text, a body of text or an author as in iti ?ruti?, iti p?dme, iti bha??at?rth?u etc. But that is the normal scholarly protocol of their intellectual tradition.
