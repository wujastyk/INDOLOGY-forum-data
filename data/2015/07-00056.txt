Dear listfolk,

you might be interested in?Rajiv Malhotra's?response to the comments here on his?speech in Bangkok from McComas Taylor: 
Rajiv Malhotra: 
    * "First thanks for taking note of my talk, which is a step better than ignoring. 
    * Second he stereotypes my position, which is hardly a sign of a good scholar. 
    * My book targets a very specific group I have termed American Orientalists , and explains how these differ from the earlier European Orientalists. So its not a sweeping statement as he makes it seem. 
    * Also, Vico is used by me precisely the way Sheldon Pollock does - he must have heard of Pollock and if he read Pollock he would know where/how Vico fits into Pollock's thesis. In other words, Vico is cited by me in my purva-paksha of pollock. I criticize his use of Vico in Sanskrit philology. So Shri MaComas needs to do more homework - please get into the reading habit; its better than hearsay. 
    * Regarding his comment that I would be pleased to see many of the papers at the Congress, yes thats true, But this is a major change from last congress in thailand 10 years ago. That was when I presented my " Geopolitics and Sanskrit Phobia " paper then (available on the net; also translated into Sanskrit and published by Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan), as a result of which the Congress organizers made many changes this time to bring in more traditional voices . Its a result of this new awareness that (contrary to last time) the Indian govt spent heavily to support this event, and sent a large contingent from India. So dear Shri McComas, I am glad you appreciate the changes as a result of my "fire-brand" work over the past decade. But there is much more in the pipeline. So pls stay tuned." 
Kind regards,
