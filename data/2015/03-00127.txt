Subject: [INDOLOGY] Brahmi in a Babylonian Inscription??
Message-ID: <CAMGmO4+Xd7Y-TXpKv9iuYhmL-HNSk9G7d5ajpwjVoBb6eGyxag@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Colleagues,

I have been asked about an article:

  A Line of Bra?hmi? (?) Script in a Babylonian Contract Tablet

 G. V. Bobrinskoy

 Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 56, No. 1 (Mar., 1936), pp.
86-88
  I am very far from being a specialist in Brahmi, but I'm not convinced.
But I couldn't see that anyone has responded to this article... ever. The
date of the tablet is pre-A?okan, which only makes me more suspicious,
but...
(A quick look through von Hin?ber's book on early writing did not show up
any reference, nor is there reference in Salomon's inscriptions book).
