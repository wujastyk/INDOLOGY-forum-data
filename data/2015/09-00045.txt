[INDOLOGY] Intensive Bangla courses in Kolkata, Dhaka, Santiniketan
I am writing on behalf of one of my graduate students at the University of Sydney who has some background in Sanskrit and plans to do field research in West Bengal and Bangladesh.
Do any members of the list have experience with intensive Bangla language courses in Kolkata, Dhaka, Santiniketan or elsewhere in the region? Are there any that they would particularly recommend?
Best wishes
