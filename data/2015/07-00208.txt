I am much grateful to Walter Slaje, Christophe Vielle, Roland Steiner, Dipak Bhattacharya and Madhav Deshpande, who very kindly provided me the reference and reading materials on it.
Now it is certain that the verse does not appear in the R?jatara?gin? as many works and websites erroneously mention. It is found first mentioned in the Sahy?drikha??a.
Thanking all of you again and the indology listserv,
Best Wishes,

Re: [INDOLOGY] Tracing a verse in Kalha?a's R?jatara?gin?
Hello Rohana,
     I have attached an article of mine that discusses these and similar verses, and the division of Gau?a and Dr?vi?a.

Dear All,
I will be very much thankful if you could kindly help me locate the following verse in Kalha?a's R?jatara?gin?, which describes the ten classes of Brahmins. Many secondary works cite it as appearing in the R?jatara?gin? but does not give the exact reference.
?kar???ak?? ca taila?g? dr?vi?? mah?r???rak?? gurjar?? ceti pancaiva dr?vi?? vindhyadak?i?e | s?rasvat?? k?nyakubj? gau?? utkalamaithil?? pa?cagau?? iti khy?t? vindhyasyottarav?sina?.?
[The five Dr?vi?a classes (Pa?ca Dr?vi?as) living to the south of the Vindhy? (mountain range) are Kar???akas (in Karnataka), Taila?gas (in Andhra), Dr?vi?as (in Tamilnadu and Kerala), those in Mah?r???ra and those in Gurjaras (in Gujarat). S?rasvatas (in Punjab, Kashmir & Sindh), K?nyakubjas (in Uttar Pradesh), Gau?as (in Kurukshetra and Rajasthan), Utkalas (in Orissa), and Maithil?s (in Bihar) living to the north of the Vindhya are known as the five Gau?a classes (Pa?ca Gau?as.)].
Thank you very much in advance.
Best Wishes,
