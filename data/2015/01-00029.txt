[INDOLOGY] Downloadable sanskrit books from Oxford
Dear list members,
I thought this might be useful to other list members.
In response to my query for Buhlers Paleography I was sent a link to the
University of Oxford. (Thank you Rohana Seneviratne).

Using the search term "sanskrit" and then restricting to on-line resources
there are 461 downloadable books dealing with Sanskrit..
Regards,
Harry
