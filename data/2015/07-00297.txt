[INDOLOGY] Does anyone know of Sanskrit works that use 2nd-syllable	rhyming
Sri Naresh Keerthi wrote :
recitative/performative forms that were half-way between poems and songs,
as well as into genres that were entirely song like.
features found in proverbs, riddles and other verbal folklore
forms functioning as auditory aesthetic forms serving as memorising tools
for the tradition-bearers of these oral traditions.
It is more reasonable to expect a sharing of this feature by the native
verse-meters and lyrical forms with the folklore forms or diffusion of
these features from the verbal folklore forms and folk songs into
verse-meters rather than from verse-meters into song-forms.
