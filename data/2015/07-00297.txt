----- Both first syllable and second syllable intraline rhymings are
features found in proverbs, riddles and other verbal folklore
forms functioning as auditory aesthetic forms serving as memorising tools
for the tradition-bearers of these oral traditions.

It is more reasonable to expect a sharing of this feature by the native
verse-meters and lyrical forms with the folklore forms or diffusion of
these features from the verbal folklore forms and folk songs into
verse-meters rather than from verse-meters into song-forms.
