Subject: [INDOLOGY] Bengali language learning in Dhaka
Message-ID: <5070DB65-1F5E-4EBC-99EC-EA79898E91F6@me.com>

Dear List members, 

Can anyone recommend an experienced language school or individual tutor in Dhaka for Bengali language intensives in both speaking and literature reading, very preferably a rickshaw ride away from Baridhara? Current level intermediate. I am not there presently, but will be in July and in the future.

The three schools in Banani (google search) would be suitably close, but I am interested in any other recommendations/experiences list members can share. 

Apologies for the cross posting. I am happy to receive any replies off list. 

Thank you,
