[INDOLOGY] Bengali language learning in Dhaka
Dear List members, 
Can anyone recommend an experienced language school or individual tutor in Dhaka for Bengali language intensives in both speaking and literature reading, very preferably a rickshaw ride away from Baridhara? Current level intermediate. I am not there presently, but will be in July and in the future.
The three schools in Banani (google search) would be suitably close, but I am interested in any other recommendations/experiences list members can share. 
Apologies for the cross posting. I am happy to receive any replies off list. 
Thank you,
