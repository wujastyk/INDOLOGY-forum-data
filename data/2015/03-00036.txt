Prof. K. Nachimuthu was the former Chairperson of Center of Indian Languages (CIL) at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) in Delhi and is the current Head of the Department of Tamil at the Central University of Tamil Nadu (CUTN) in Tiruv?r?r, the Indian partner institution in the European Research Council-sponsored project entitled "Going from Hand to Hand: Networks of Intellectual Exchange in the Tamil Learned Traditions" (http://www.manuscript-cultures.uni-hamburg.de/netamil/images/network.png).
Prof. Nachimuthu claims in a Tamil blog ( http://nirappirikai.blogspot.com/2010/11/blog-post_8125.html ) that the author(s) of the N??ya??stra, and Pata?jali, the author of the Mah?bh??ya were Tamils.  I would like to know if this view is shared by other Indologists.
Thanks in advance
