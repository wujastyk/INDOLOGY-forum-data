I am working on a paper in which I want to refer to a
practice in India I recall  hearing about, whereby pupils learning to
the Vedas sit in pairs and recite one syllable at a time, alternating
back and forth between them. Do you know of such a practice? If so, do
you know of any published accounts of it that you could refer me to?
The reason I am intested is in connection with a paper I am writing on forms of dialogue and the way they figure in the performance of 'monologic' texts. The alternating-syllables method of performance involving two speakers is common in Native South America, as discussed by Greg Urban in his 1986 article
'Ceremonial Dialogues in South America' (https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~gurban/pdfs/Urban-Ceremonial_Dialogues_in_South_America.pdf<https://www.sas.upenn.edu/%7Egurban/pdfs/Urban-Ceremonial_Dialogues_in_South_America.pdf>)
