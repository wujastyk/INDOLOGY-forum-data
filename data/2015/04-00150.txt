[INDOLOGY] Earthquake Nepal
Dear friends,
The Rubin Museum of Art, New York, has compiled a useful page listing links to NGOs, Charities and Relief
Organizations active in Nepal, and reputed for their high levels of service. Their individual sites
provide information regarding their knowledge of current circumstances, the needs of the moment,
and the manner in which contributions may be made:
