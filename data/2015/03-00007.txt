 From the back cover:
Confronted with warfare and the urgency of spreading Buddhist teachings, 
in the 12th century the Sinhalese monk A?nanda, himself a refugee in 
South India, composed a work addressing lay persons. What beliefs and 
practices define a lay Buddhist, and how do they inform her or his daily 
life to the point of shaping the relationship between husband and wife 
or employers and employees? And what beliefs and practices are 
incompatible with Buddhism? The result, the most detailed treatise on 
lay followers (upa?saka) handed down by the tradition, is here translated 
into English in its entirety for the first time. A?nanda marshals an 
impressive number of otherwise scattered canonical and post-canonical 
passages, encompassing in nine chapters many aspects of Buddhism, 
including the philosophically important doctrine of ?no-self?, often 
considered the domain of learned monks because of its subtlety and the 
unattached outlook it requires on one?s property, life and person.
