[resending, bec. it did not seem to come through last night]

Madhav,

AiB may be referring to other cases of hypometric or hypermetric verse than the sort arising when a dissyllabic ia/iya or ua/uva is reduced by sandhi to ya or va.  In fact, I'd say AiB *must* be referring to other cases, since there is no way for the k?aipra sandhi to produce a hypermetric (adhikabh?va, in AiB) stanza.

Hello Tim,

     I myself was surprised by the statement from the Aitareya Br?hma?a that I have cited.  How to bridge that statement and the treatment in the Pr?ti??khyas that you refer to is an important question.  One possibility is that the analytical tradition of the Pr?ti??khyas became consciously aware of the metrical deviations and tried to account for them, while the tradition represented by the AB did not much care for this issue.  This is perhaps analogous to the earliest oral traditions of the Veda did produce variant branch Samhit?s with different readings, but with the later development of the rigorous methods of recitation like the various permutational Vik?tip??has, further splitting of the Sa?hit?s was arrested.  With metrical deviations, there is a similar possibility.  That is just my guess.  Best,

Madhav

But, Madhav, isn't it the case that the Pr?ti??khyas (e.g., ?kpr. 8.22 and 17.14) recognize that in Vedic hymns y and v must often be pronounced i and u?  Isn't indeed the Taittir?ya convention of writing, e.g., suvar an explicit acknowledgement that it is dissyllabic, despite the convention elsewhere (where, nevertheless, a dissyllabic pronunciation might tacitly be acknowledged -- albeit this is a special case, a fixed form in TS.

It is not clear how much the tradition was bothered by metrical inconsistencies.  There is an interesting passage in the Aitareya Br?hmana that says: na v? eken?k?are?a chand??si viyanti na dv?bhy?m.  Even by a deviation of up to  two syllables, the tradition did not consider the meter to be violated.  The text titled Vedavic?ra (19th century) that I am editing and translating cites this passages and extends it further: ekena dv?bhy?m ity upalak?a?am, tasm?d ak?arany?n?dhikabh?vena chand??si n?nyath? bhavanti.  Thus, it seems to be that "metrically restored RV" is a purely modern creation.  If the Br?hma?a texts were not bothered by deviations of meters up to two syllables, can we be so certain that the authors of the Vedic hymns were so bothered.  There is a possibility that "metrically restoring texts" could be something like a modern hyper-correction.  Modern reciters of the Vedas that I am familiar with do not seem to worry about reciting a metrically correct text.  While they seem to show interest in reciting the various P??has and their permutations, I am not at all certain that they are scanning the recited text for metrical deviations.

It is the metrically restored text which the ?k-Pr?ti??khya enjoins for recitation. I have heard the disyllabic recitation from at least two Vedic reciters and was myself advised to do so with the few verses that I had to learn to utter as a child. But I have not examined each and every case of recitation.  I hope Professor Deshpande has the same experience

Dear list members,

Do any members know if when the Rg Veda is recited by Vaidikas if that recitation agrees with the metrically restored Rg Veda or if they recite it like the written text with the metrical anomalies.

Thanks,
Harry Spier
