[INDOLOGY] Manuscripts in India
We have discussed this earlier. Here a record delay:
"in 1973-74 I visited the Benares Sanskrit University three times and tried to obtain a microfilm copy of the unique MS of the Black Yajurveda Kapis?t?hala Sam?hita?. I duly paid the required fee, even gave them an undeveloped microfilm and a bottle of developer, all to no avail. When the director of the Library recently wrote to me on another matter, I answered he should first please send me the microfilm, a quarter of a century later: no answer was received. I then wrote to the Go?ttingen University library to obtain a copy of this MS, made for Kielhorn more than 100 years ago. They replied that they were rather busy; nevertheless the pdf arrived three weeks later... "

Cheers!
