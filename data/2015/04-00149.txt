Dear Friends and Colleagues,
In case you have not seen them, may I draw your attention to the Third  
Announcement and Attendance Detail Form ? Our colleagues in Bangkok  
have just announced them together with the academic programme. Please  
see the links here:

Please note that the Attendance Form now requires our passport  
details, etc. In case you have any questions concerning the  
organisation in Bangkok please write to the Secretariat there at the  
mail address in the Cc.

Looking forward to seeing you there.

With best wishes and thanks to our colleagues in Bangkok,
Jay Soni
Secretary General of the IASS
