[INDOLOGY] query [regarding the correct version of a	defectively cited verse]
??????????????????? should be avoided: (a) If an existing reading makes a contextually probable sense, it should not be changed. (b) A corruption of ?? to ?: is not transcriptionally probable. (c) The other two syntactically similar clauses of the verse have an action or a state associated with a person or personified entity ? Indra rules in svarga and R?ma?s story exists in the world. If an action (?being a maker of prabh?, spreading light?) is not associated with Candra, which would be the case if prabh?kara is taken in the sense of ?the Sun,? the second quarter would be out of step with the other two. It is very unusual for a Skt composer not to have a sense of symmetry.
