[INDOLOGY] Religious Literature with Political Purposes
Kunal Chakrabarti's: 'Religious Process: The Pur??as and the Making of a
Regional Tradition' (OUP, 2001) is the best in depth account of this kind
of phenomenon that I have encountered. It is about Bengal Pur??as but
applies widely to other contexts.
