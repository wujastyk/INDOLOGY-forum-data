The question is: who functions in the role of priests at Kamakhya Devi?

Priests of local tribal cults?

If not, I would rather see there not "tribalization", but rather
"controlled Sanskritization" of tribal cultural elements, undertaken not by
the tribals, but by the local representatives of Sanskritic culture.
Motivated, as you have noticed, by the political need to communicate on one
hand with the local population, on the other - with the broader network of
sub-continental cult/pilgrimage centers.
