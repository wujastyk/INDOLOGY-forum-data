[INDOLOGY] rubrication in Indian mss.
Dear Christoph,
Your comment is very interesting, and there does seem to be a prima facie similarity between
what is described in Dominic's passage and parabaik techniques. But when does paper-making
(or parabaik-making) technology begin in SE Asia? What do we know of its early history in the
region?
all best,
Matthew
