partnership development between institutions in Canada, India and Southeast

?Cosmopolitanism? in science. The project closely examines the ideas,
processes and negotiations that inform the development of science and
scientific cultures within an increasingly globalized landscape. A detailed
description of the project can be found at: www.CosmoLocal.org
<http://wordpress.us3.list-manage.com/track/click?u=2d4375ec5dc6ff29d727d7830&id=36850e11c7&e=07a32a0bb9>

The position provides a base salary equivalent to $35,220 plus benefits
(EI, CPP, Medical and Dental), and with the possibility of augmenting the
salary through teaching or other awards, depending on the host department.
The fellow would be entitled to benefits offered by University of King?s
College or Dalhousie University. The successful applicant will begin their
12-month appointment between April 1st and July 1st, 2015, subject to
