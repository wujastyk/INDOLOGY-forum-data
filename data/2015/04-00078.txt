The Mangulam inscription of 2nd century BC uses the Prakrit ?Siri? as in "Nanta-siri". Is that of interest to you? See pp. 314-319 of 'Early Tamil Epigraph' by Iravatham Mahadevan, Harvard Oriental Series, vol. 62, 2003.
While normally one would expect the honorific to be in front of the names, there are Malayalam titles such as Namp?tiri, Bha??atiri, etc., which are explained as having the tadbhava form of ?r? at the end.
Was something like this prevalent in the north?
