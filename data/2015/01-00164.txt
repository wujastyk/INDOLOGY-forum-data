[INDOLOGY] Vedic verse in Ortega y Gasset
Dear Colleagues,
If I may humbly take this rare opportunity to self-promote, in an upcoming monograph on Vi?v?mitra (Crossing the Lines of Caste, OUP, May 2015), I?ve tried to layer both Vedic and post-Vedic/post-classical meanings of dh?mahi through the following translation: 
?Let us place [within us/our minds upon] 
that most desirable radiance of the Lord, the Sun, 
Who may then stimulate our own insights.?
I hope that the respected members of this list might not find it entirely objectionable.
With best wishes,
Adheesh
