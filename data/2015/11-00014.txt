Dear friends and colleagues,

It gives me great pleasure to announce the approval by the Union of  
the German Academies of Sciences of a long term research project on  
the Buddhist murals in the Kucha region (Xinjiang province). The  
project, which will be conducted at the Institute for Indology and  
Central Asian Studies of the University of Leipzig, will fund five  
positions, four in Buddhist art history and one in digital humanities,  
for a period of fifteen years.

With best wishes  (and apologies for cross-posting),
Eli Franco
