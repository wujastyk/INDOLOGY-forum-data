Dear Indology List, Suresh, Palaniappan ?
Thank you immensely for discussing this topic and bringing out the details to the unknown.
I just wanted to share some sporadic thoughts, which have been painful for me over the years.
There?s a problem of methodology here. 
(i) The saddest situation is that many Westerners (scholars or not) have been somehow captivated by Naga.Ganesan?s (NG?s) gesture, and have been exploited by him. NG has been promoting himself as someone who helps Westerners with his knowledge of this and that. I?ve heard that he?d send books/computers ? and people would fall at his feet for that gesture!! How sick! I know for sure that a few of my academic colleagues have fallen a prey. These academic colleagues are so lame to do their own research but would ask NG for ready reference and there you go ? a pile of Googlish junk at hand for those lazy Westerners to extrapolate.
(ii) Our teacher Auvai Duraicami Pillai explained to us that ?viTankar? (vi?ankar) was ?one formed without being chiseled.? 
	(iia) In any case, ?i?ankar? (for crocodile in ca?kam texts) and ?vitankar? (for referring to ?iva in bhakti texts) are NOT related.
(iii) The Internet has been harboring a lot of unfortunate mishmashings.
++++++++++++++
I sincerely thank the Indology List for maintaining its integrity.
Thanks and regards,
V.S.Rajam
