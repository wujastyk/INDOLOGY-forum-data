[INDOLOGY] Religious Literature with Political Purposes
Dear Paolo,
consider the reverse process? Doesn't seem that were the Hindus to emulate
the tribal-men incorporating tribal worship elements?
To my mind, both.
A perfect example of a dialogic situation, whatever the motivation behind
the move to set up a new, structurally enriched place of worship and a
newly conceived object of veneration.
Best,
Artur
