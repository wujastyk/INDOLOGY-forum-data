Where Ashok says ?traditionally, texts of the NS type??,  he refers to this passage:  trividh? c?sya ??strasya prav?tti? | udde?o lak?a?a? par?k?? ceti | (ny?yabh??yam 1.1.3)

v?caspati?s comment, tadasya nir?kara?a? lak?a?agaten?locanaj??n?varodh?rthen?vyapade?yapadena s?citamiti
par?k??parva?i vacan?rhamapi subh??itarucitay? tadvilambamasaham?no bh??yak?ro lak?a??vasara ev?ha |
ata ev?ha - avyapade?yamit?ti | (ny?yav?rttikat?tparya??k? 1.1.4 per Gretil), reflects the position ??lik?n?tha? states, ?abdasa?jalpan?nuviddhasya pratyak?asya ??bdatv??a?k? ??bdapar?k??parva?i nir?kartumucit? (pram??ap?r?ya?am per Gretil). Both ??lik?n?tha? and v?caspati? say that the argument pak?ilasv?m? presents here anticipates an argument that properly belongs in the (??bda)par?k??parva. uddyotarakara? marks the beginning of ?abdapar?k?? when he says ath?vasarapr?pta? ?abda? par?k?yate (beginning of comment to ny?yas?tram 2.1.49, page 245 line 16 in Anantalal Thakur's 1997 edition).

While v?caspati? certainly may have known this view from ??likan?tha?s work, and it is possible that ??likan?tha? first articulated it, it is more likely that a lost ny?ya? commentary is the source of this view.

Unless V?caspati-mi?ra and ??likan?tha have actually quoted phrases or sentences not found in the lak?a?a and par?k?? sections of the commentandum, there would be no reason to assume that they are going beyond the thought-world of the commentandum (actual in V?caspati-mi?ra?s case, contextually presupposed in ??likan?tha?s case).

(by searching within the GRETIL input s.v.) and which seems to correspond to the ??bdapar?k??parvan referred to in the 6th chapter (Pram??a-p?r?ya?a,  pratyak?a-pariccheda/section) of ??likan?tha's Prakara?apa?cik?. Could this be referring to a book or section of the commentary on the NS by Uddyotakara, or to a work of Bhart?hari ?
