[INDOLOGY] Mahabharata retold
Dear colleagues,
Some of you may be interested in Carole Satyamurti?s ?The Mahabharata: a Modern Retelling?, which appeared a few months ago, published by Norton and Co. The publisher?s webpage for this book is: http://books.wwnorton.com/books/Mahabharata/
The author is an acclaimed poet, and a few weeks ago the book was announced as co-winner of the inaugural Roehampton Poetry Prize (see http://www.roehampton.ac.uk/News/2015/June/Inaugural-Roehampton-Poetry-Prize-announcement-celebrates--marvels--of-modern-poetry/ ). A paperback edition is expected early next year.
In the same month as Satyamurti?s version, another retelling of the Mahabharata, by David Slavitt, was published by Northwestern University Press: http://nupress.northwestern.edu/content/mahabharata
If anyone has seen (or can provide) a review of Slavitt?s version, I would be grateful to hear of it.
