Speaking of horns, RV 1.163, one of the two asvastutis in the RV, refers to
the horse's golden horns [in stanza 9], while in stanza 11 it is said that
his horns branch out in many directions.  Clearly, the horse is wearing a
reindeer mask like the one found in Pazyryk. See Sergei Rudenko *Frozen
Tombs of Siberia: The Pazyryk Burials of Iron-Age Horsemen* [published in
Russian in 1953 and translated into English in 1970].

cheers,

George
