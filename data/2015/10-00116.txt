Dear Friends,

I have been looking for a PDF of the following edition of the Meghad?ta.
After looking for it at several platforms I am still not able to find it,
and I turn to our 'Indology Group'.

<<Meghad?ta, edited with a complete translation into English, introduction,
notes, appendices and extracts from the commentaries of Vallabha,
Dak?i??varta, and Mallin?tha by R.D. Karmarkar.>>

I would highly appreciate if someone can share a PDF with me.

With my best wishes.

Mrinal
