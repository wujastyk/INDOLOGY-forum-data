We can grant reliability in how the money will be used towards restoration
of the dilapidated structures. Since Nepal depends to a great extent on
tourism, we must make sure that this central source of income is guaranteed
as fast and professionally done as possible. But we also want to make sure
that the rich local social and ritual life is restored, along with the hope
thereof, since this will last many years. Moreover, we want to use our
regional competence to help the Nepali people and their unique heritage.
And we want you to know that you can trust that the money you donate is
securely invested.
If you want to donate, please transfer it to
