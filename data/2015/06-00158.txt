[INDOLOGY] prof. or mr. or mrs. or ms. etc first name
In view of recent posts on this thread, I have been wondering about ?Dr Robert?, the eponymous subject of the famous Beatles song (?Ring my friend I said you?d call, Dr Robert / Day or night he?ll be there any time at all, Dr Robert ??). If this were a surname, one would rather expect the genitive patronymic ?Roberts?. Indeed, according to the informative webpage http://www.beatlesebooks.com/dr-robert, it appears that candidates for real-life characters upon whom this Dr Robert might be loosely based include a Charles Roberts; but the writer of that page plumps instead for Dr Robert Freymann ? without, I should add, any indication that this title-plus-first-name moniker was influenced by the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi or any other acquaintances of subcontinental origin.

Ah, yes, ecclesiatical titles.  Of course.

And nobility.  As in one of our own,
