[INDOLOGY] view/value of Western secondary qualifications	(GCSE/A-Level etc) in India?
Dear all,
Does there happen to be anyone on this list who is familiar with the
process by which universities/tertiary education institutions in India
select their students, or more specifically: whether they take into
account/how they value students taking Western qualifications such as
GCSE/A-Levels, IB or Cambridge Pre-U? Is there perhaps a preference for one
among those (or for one not mentioned here)?
(I am asking on behalf of Sanskrit at StJames, whose Sanskrit teaching
materials for GCSE and A-Level are already used by a certain number of
schools in India - see e.g.

)
Many thanks,
