Subject: [INDOLOGY] view/value of Western secondary qualifications	(GCSE/A-Level etc) in India?
Message-ID: <CAEjEOsCdD5z3KmnrnNa=n9_8YAWPiGf0oP9W9R5ZcSJiQW5Jnw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

Does there happen to be anyone on this list who is familiar with the
process by which universities/tertiary education institutions in India
select their students, or more specifically: whether they take into
account/how they value students taking Western qualifications such as
GCSE/A-Levels, IB or Cambridge Pre-U? Is there perhaps a preference for one
among those (or for one not mentioned here)?

(I am asking on behalf of Sanskrit at StJames, whose Sanskrit teaching
materials for GCSE and A-Level are already used by a certain number of
schools in India - see e.g.
http://www.dailyo.in/arts/sanskrit-language-education-moglys-gurukul-school-textbook/story/1/2940.html
)

Many thanks,
     Antonia
