[INDOLOGY] Article by Jean Filliozat in Yoga et Vie 26 (1978)?
Dear colleagues,
?
I would like to read Jean Filliozat's article "Le Yoga et les substances
psychotropes" that was published in
?the journal ?
?*?*
*Y*
*?oga ?*
*?et*
*? ?*
*V*
*?ie*?
num. 26
?, in 1978?
.
?The journal is published by ??l?Association du Centre de Relations
Culturelles Franco-Indien, who have written to me offering an annual
subscription to the current issue of the journal?.  The organization took a
year to send me this response.  Before I start wrangling with them about
the specific issue of their journal, I thought I'd ask INDOLOGY.
Can you help with this?
Many thanks,
Dominik Wujastyk
