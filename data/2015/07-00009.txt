[INDOLOGY] GRETIL update #467
Dear Reinhold,
     The header of the file for ?abdavy?p?ravic?ra reads:
  Mammata: Sabdavyaparavicara
Based on the ed. by Mangesh Ramkrishna Telang: Abhidha?vr?ttima?trika? of
Mukula Bhatta and S?abdavya?pa?ravica?ra of Ra?ja?naka Mahimabhat?t?a,
Bombay : Nirnaya Sagar Press, 1916.
Is there a dispute over authorship of this text.  The header suggests that
the edition of Mamma?a's ?abdavy?p?ravic?ra is based on the edition of
?abdavy?p?ravic?ra of R?j?naka Mahimabha??a.  I am wondering if there is
some error involved in this reference.
Madhav
