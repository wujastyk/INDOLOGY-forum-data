[INDOLOGY] cArvAka/lokAyata
Dear colleagues,
Might any of you be aware of positive epigraphical evidence of teachers designated
as cArvAka or lokAyata. I am of course aware of the literary references, but am
here solely concerned with whether or not we find any epigraphical support.
with thanks in advance,
Matthew
