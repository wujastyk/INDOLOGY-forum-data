The /Brahmay?malatantra/ (aka /Picumata/) is probably one of the 
earliest surviving ?aiva tantras, and possibly the earliest one known to 
us of the Bhairavatantra tradition. The present volume contains a 
critical edition and annotated translation of three of its chapters: one 
on the central /ma??ala/ of the cult, one on preliminary religious 
observances (/vrata/) prescribed for all practitioners (/s?dhaka/), and 
one on instructions for each individual category of /s?dhaka/ ? 
instructions on transgressive sexual rituals for the T?laka, on strict 
rules of conduct for the chaste Carubhojin, and on a combination of 
these for the Mixed Practitioner. This unique system of /s?dhaka/s marks 
an early phase in the development of classification of practitioners 
seeking liberation and magical powers, and gives us an insight into the 
tantric world of extremes: of rule-bound sexual encounters involving 
several female partners and highly impure substances on the one hand, 
and of asceticism, strict vegetarianism and chastity on the other.
The introduction deals with the main topics raised by the selected 
chapters, as well as with problems of the sometimes extremely 
non-standard (Ai?a) Sanskrit that the oldest manuscript transmits. One 
of the appendices provides a summary of the first twenty-five chapters 
(about one quarter of the /Brahmay?mala/) to facilitate further study. 
The extensive index includes all important keywords and all major Ai?a 
phenomena.
