Dear colleagues,

I was wondering whether any of you could help with tracing definitions
of v?rttika as a type of commentary.

Hemacandra gives this definition in the Abhidh?nacint?ma?i:

Abhidh?nacint?ma?i 2.170  [=Boethlingk/Rieu ed. verse no. 256]:
ukt?nuktadurukt?rthacint?k?ri tu v?rttikam | ??k? nirantaravy?khy?
pa?jik? padabha?jik? ||

A v?rttika thus scrutinizes (the basic text) in terms of what has been
taught in it, what has not been taught in it, and what has been badly
taught in it. (Some remarks in Wezler 1974 on Yuktid?pik?, and 1975
Sekund?r-Suffixe-P??ini)

A different definition is found in some Buddhist pram??a commentaries.

Praj??karagupta's Pram??av?rttik?la?k?rabh??ya (ed. S??k?ty?yana 1953, p
521): s?tr???m anupapatticodan?(t? cf. below) tatparih?ro
vi?e??bhidh?na? ceti v?rttikalak?a?am.

Vibh?ticandra's notes attached to the paper manuscript of
Manorathanandin's Pram??av?rttikav?tti (reproduced in the edition of PVV
S??k?ty?yana 1938-40, p. 516):

v?rttika? ca vi?e??bhidh?n?dir?pa? yathokta? s?tr?n?? anupapatticodan?t
tatparih?ro vi?e??bhidh?nam iti lak?a?am <|> ayam ev?rtha? parokta? |

s?tr?n?? do?am udbh?vya parih?ro yatra d?yate |
vi?e?acodan? c?pi v?rttika? tat prak?rtitam <||> iti ||

(Emendations to first half necessary for metrical and grammatical
reasons, perhaps "parih?ro 'tra dyotyate"?)

I'm not sure how to best make sense of the second definition. Does
anyone know other occurrences of it, or pertinent discussions?

Thank you in advance,

Birgit Kellner
