[INDOLOGY] bibliographic assistance request
Dear fellow Indologists,
	I am editing a bibliography concerning Sanskrit syntax and have two questions concerning the page ranges of papers that I am unable to answer from my present location in Bombay.  Would one of you located at a good research library be able to assist me by supplying the information indicated in red in these two bibliography entries?
	Thank you in advance.
	Yours,
	Peter
