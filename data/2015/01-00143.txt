[INDOLOGY] Vedic verse in Ortega y Gasset
Buongiorno Paolo,
I thought exactly the same as Dipak, but was waiting for the opinion of people more learned than myself to see what they said. 
A very 'chinese whispers' and literary translation + anthropological connection with morning prayer?
best regards to all,

  Dear Colleagues,
 in his ?Meditaciones del Quixote?, Ortega y Gasset says: ?? a la ma?ana, cuando me levanto, recito una brev?sima plegaria, vieja de miles de a?os, un versillo del Rig-
 Veda, que contiene estas pocas palabras aladas: ? ?Se?or, despi?rtanos alegres y danos conocimiento!?. Preparado as? me interno en las horas luminosas o dolientes que trae el d?a?. [??when I get up in the morning, I recite a very brief prayer, thousands of years old, a verse from the Rig Veda, which contains these few winged words: ?Lord, awaken us in a happy mood, and give us knowledge!?. Thus prepared, I go through the bright or gloomy hours that come with the day? (Transl. E. Rugg and D. Mar?n)].
 Can anyone guess what the verse in question might be?
