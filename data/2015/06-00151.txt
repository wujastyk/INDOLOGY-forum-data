[INDOLOGY] request
I thank Prof. Paturi for his suggestion, but the "conditions for getting access" make this option non-viable (basically one has to get an institutional librarian to subscribe to their service).
Does anyone have a less daunting way of acquiring a PDF of Jha's Pra?astap?da translation?
Thanks, again.

  But there are conditions for getting access to download.
