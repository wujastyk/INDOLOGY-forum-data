Possible indexes to assist research into Government officials in
Pondicherry around 1690-1699
Hi,
I was researching indexes which might help my wife's research. I am getting
a 404 on the one at the French Institute at Pondicherry, though I have
already emailed them for advice.
I wonder whether you could guide me to sources that might be able to help.
the area of research is outlined below.
My wife Katy is travelling from Scotland to Pondicherry next month.
