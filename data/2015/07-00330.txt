[INDOLOGY] Does anyone know of Sanskrit works that use 2nd-syllable	rhyming?
Prof. Hauben,
I was away from the computer for a couple of days. Hence the delay in my
response.
You said:
Re: the statement which you forwarded, apparently with approval. This is purely
hypothetical and beyond verification as the oldest text sufficiently attested
that uses and reflects on verse-meters, the Rgveda, is also permeated by
the knowledge and employment of "song-forms": saamans.
I am not able to identify my statement that I 'forwarded' with 'approval'.
Is it the following statement from Sri Naresh Keerthi? :
as well as into genres that were entirely song like.
If this is the one, I disagreed with the observation and said:
*Both first syllable and second syllable intraline rhymings are
features found in proverbs, riddles and other verbal folklore*
*forms functioning as auditory aesthetic forms serving as memorising
tools for the tradition-bearers of these oral traditions.*
*It is more reasonable to expect a sharing of this feature by the
native verse-meters and lyrical forms with the folklore forms or
diffusion of*
*these features from the verbal folklore forms and folk songs into
verse-meters rather than from verse-meters into song-forms.*
'verse-meters' here are not the Vaidika or loukika Samskrita meters but the
Dravidian verse-meters.
Relation between Veda mantra recitation in different styles such as pada,
ghana etc. and their singing in saaman style is a different story than the
verse-song relation in Dravidian native verbal lore.
recitation and singing styles of vedic hymns have a long tradition of oral
preservation.
There is no such preserved memory of ancient verse-recitation/singing style
of ancient times in Dravidian verbal lore.
