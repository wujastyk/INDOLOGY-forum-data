Dear colleagues,
Can anyone help me trace the precise location of the following quote?
s?tr?rtho var?yate yatra v?kyai? s?tr?nus?ribhi? |
svapad?ni ca var?yante bh??ya? bh??yavido vidu? ||
My colleague Shilpa Sumant and I had once found this definition in Jayat?rtha's Ny?yasudh?, somewhere after p. 467 in vol. 1 of K.T. Pandurangi's edition (Bangalore, c. 2002-2006); that edition reads s?tr?nuk?ribhi?. But we don't have said edition at hand at the moment and cannot find the quotation anymore.
A precise bibliographic reference and, ideally, a scan of the relevant page plus title page, would be greatly appreciated.
