=?utf-8?Q?[INDOLOGY]_Two_additional_recensions_of_the_=E1=B9=9Agveda_available?=
As most of you know, two recensions of the ?gveda in addition to the long
standard ??kala/??kalya recension have become available in the last several
years. They are:
??val?yana-Sa?hit? of the ?gveda, ed. B. B. Chaubey, 2 vols., New Delhi:
Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts, 2009.
The ?gveda Sa?hit? of ???kh?yana-??kh?, ed. Amal Dhari Singh Gautam, 4
vols., Ujjain: Maharshi Sandipani Rashtriya Veda Vidya Pratishthan,
2012-2013.
I would be very interested in comments from the Vedic scholars here about
the significance of having two additional recensions of the ?gveda. In
particular, I was earlier informed that an 1897 book in Danish by Hans
Vodskov, Rig-veda og Edda, has a chapter attempting to demonstrate that the
?gveda we have shows a very late style. My informant noted that Vodskov's
views about the late style of the ??kala recension have not been adopted by
Vedic scholars. Now that we have two additional recensions, almost
identical to the ??kala recension, I assume that this would be significant
evidence for an early, unchanged style.
As for linguistic peculiarities, as opposed to stylistic ones, Madhav
Deshpande had noted in his 1993 book, Sanskrit & Prakrit: Sociolinguistic
Issues, p. 134: "In most recent discussions, a historical fact of utmost
importance is often overlooked, namely that the text of the ?gveda that we
have today is not necessarily the original ?gveda. What we have is only one
recension (sa?hit?) of the ?gveda compiled several centuries after the
hymns were composed by the ?gvedic sages."
Now we have three recensions, together presumably bringing us closer to the
original ?gveda.
