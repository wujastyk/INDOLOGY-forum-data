Subject: [INDOLOGY] OCR for Romanized Sanskrit with Abbyy FineReader

There is an OCR program specifically optimized for Devanagari, written by
Oliver Hellwig <http://www.sanskritreader.de/>.  I've seen it demonstrated,
and it is outstanding.  I wouldn't bother with generic products built
around Latin script, however flexible.
