[INDOLOGY] A request
My thanks go to Agathe Keller --- !
Now, the page 165 of Balachandra Rao's book carries the title: "Saros and
Metonic cycle". I hoped prof. Rao would provide some information on the use
of *saros* & Metonic cycle in the Indian astronomical/astrological
practice. A disappointment: there is nothing there apart from some general
info, such as could have been culled from any simple handbook on the
history of astronomy.
Was the concept of *saros* known to ancient Indian astronomers?
Best,
