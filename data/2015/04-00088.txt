[INDOLOGY] Yantra symbol and non-Aryan culture
Dear friends of Indology list,
maybe somone can help me... I'm looking for bibliographical references
regarding the origns of *yantra *symbol in South Asia (specially in
north-eastern India). Mainly I would like to know if there is any study
regarding the relationship between *yantra *(or triangle) and tribal or
non-Aryan cultures.
Best wishes,
