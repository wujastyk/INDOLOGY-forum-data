Subject: [INDOLOGY] Yantra symbol and non-Aryan culture
Message-ID: <CAMOCTf9RVCYaYwbhE5mfRcxwW0UkDNJRO_TJCQdg2NRY5iVrzg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear friends of Indology list,

maybe somone can help me... I'm looking for bibliographical references
regarding the origns of *yantra *symbol in South Asia (specially in
north-eastern India). Mainly I would like to know if there is any study
regarding the relationship between *yantra *(or triangle) and tribal or
non-Aryan cultures.

Best wishes,

Paolo E. Rosati
