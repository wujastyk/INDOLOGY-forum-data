[INDOLOGY] Article about the politics surrounding	indology	at	the IHRC
Thank you for this clarification:
Still, neither A1 nor B1 below give explicitly racial definitions. 
B1 may logically refer to a multi-racial group speaking the same language. In America, for example, people of many races speak English. Further, ?racism? requires a belief in the superiority or inferiority of a particular race, rather than the association of a certain race with a particular body of literature. 
I understand the ugly history linked to the term ?Aryan?, but Bharadwaj deserves a fair day in court.
I?m still not sure why Bharadwaj?s remarks, at least as given in the article, are ?racist.? Has he espoused explicitly racist views?
Best,
Howard
