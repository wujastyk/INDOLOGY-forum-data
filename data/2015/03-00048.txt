[INDOLOGY] Literature on western reception of Hinduism
Belated thanks to all who offered suggestions, on and off the list, in 
response to my query. I'll certainly consider including an excerpt from 
Halbfass, but for my present purposes I believe Paul Oliver's Hinduism 
and the 1960s: The Rise of a Counter-culture may prove to be the book 
I've been looking for. Thanks again!
