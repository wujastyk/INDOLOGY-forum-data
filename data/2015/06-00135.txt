[INDOLOGY] Article about the politics surrounding indology at	the IHRC
Dear List,
I've been asked to be more specific.  Admittedly, the term "Siberian" is
very vague.  My son is engaged to a professional genealogist who encouraged
him to take a DNA test for paternal descent.  It turns out that my father,
whom I have never met, is from Yakutsk and very likely to be a Sakha of
that region.
