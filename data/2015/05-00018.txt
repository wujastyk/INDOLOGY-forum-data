Too bad that Bhattacharya felt so apprehensive about his book's reception before he died. I would like to think that Buddhist scholars aren't really as grumpy as they sometimes appear to be.  You mentioned electronic input. Do you know if there will be a kindle version forthcoming?

[INDOLOGY] New Book: The ?tman-Brahman in Ancient Buddhism
Kamaleswar Bhattacharya?s 1973 French book, L??tman-Brahman dans le Bouddhisme ancien, has just been published in English translation as The ?tman-Brahman in Ancient Buddhism. It is available from Amazon.com at: http://www.amazon.com/Atman-Brahman-Ancient-Buddhism-Kamaleswar-Bhattacharya/dp/0881810061. I do not know if the publication of this book was his last wish, because he died unexpectedly on March 16, 2014, but I have regarded it as such, as far as my duty in getting it published is concerned. Here follows some brief information about how this came about.
