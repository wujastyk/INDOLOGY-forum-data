[INDOLOGY] Modern scholarly translation of Tulsidas' Ramayana?
Dear List,
I have been asked by a former student for help in finding a modern,
reliable scholarly translation of Tulsidas' Ramayana into English.  This is
a topic that I know little about.
Can some one of you help me to steer him to a good translation?
Thank you in advance,
George Thompson
