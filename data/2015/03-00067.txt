Subject: [INDOLOGY] Modern scholarly translation of Tulsidas' Ramayana?
Message-ID: <CAP1Y1zv6rykaDSmYXK57JmrVzmngCTpSCgTQPkqGNQRiNwyaFQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear List,

I have been asked by a former student for help in finding a modern,
reliable scholarly translation of Tulsidas' Ramayana into English.  This is
a topic that I know little about.

Can some one of you help me to steer him to a good translation?

Thank you in advance,

George Thompson
