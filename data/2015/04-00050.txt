Dear Dr. Tieken,
I have shared your concern regarding Ganesan monopolizing the CTamil list even though I was not a member of that list. I have ignored him distorting my views in a CTamil post. However, Ganesan cannot be ignored in toto because in the past his actions have had serious Indological consequences. For instance, his proposal for Grantha encoding in Unicode, which had included endorsements from some Indologists, would have had adverse effects on the accurate processing of epigraphic data.   Only at the last minute his suggestions were prevented from adoption by Unicode. This could not be handled at the scholarly level alone. It ended up involving the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu and the Government of India?s Minister of Teleommunications.
