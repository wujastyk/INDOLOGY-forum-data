citation of article in The Modern Review
 Dear contributors to Indology list,
If anybody could complete the following citation of an article from 1936?s
edition of The Modern Review (Calcutta) I should be very grateful:
Dutt, Bhupendra Lal. 1936. ?The Indian National Congress ? The story of its
foundation?. *The Modern Review*  (Calcutta) 59.
I would need:
- the page numbers of the complete article in this copy
- verification that on p. 82 Munshi Madholal is named as chairman of the
reception committee of the National Congress session of 1905 in Benares.
- Is the article?s author Bhupendra Lal Dutt identical with the
revolutionary and sociologist Bhupendranath Datta (4 September 1880 ? 25
December 1961)?
There is a scan of this edition online (
http://www.scribd.com/doc/35993772/The-Modern-Review-1936-January) but the
relevant 100 pages are left out, unfortunately.
Thank you,
Ulla Remmer
