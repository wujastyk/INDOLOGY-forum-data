Hello colleagues,
I am looking for a clean, well-scanned copy of Steven Collins? article, ?On the Very Idea of the Pali Canon,? Journal of the Pali Text Society 15 (1990).
I have a copy, but the quality is not good and I want to use it for a coursepack. Does anyone have one to send my way? The library does not seem to have this journal in its repertoire for some reason.
Many thanks,
Vanessa R. Sasson
