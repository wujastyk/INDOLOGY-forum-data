Dear Manu Francis, George Thompson, Nagaraj Paturi, and others interested in this topic ? 

To give you a spec of the Tamil perspective ? 

In the Old Tamil anthology called the Akananuru (akan????u; ????????) there?s some reference to what the bride was ?told? during the wedding. 

Loosely translated: 

?Without erring from being ?chaste,? assist him and be a loving partner to him who has taken you (as his bride)? (Akananuru 86:13-14)

Here, I?ve translated the word ?kaRpu? as ?chaste? for easy reference. 

++++++++++++

Is there something similar found in non-Tamil texts?

Thanks and regards,
Rajam
