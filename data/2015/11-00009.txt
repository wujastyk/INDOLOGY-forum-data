[INDOLOGY] deciphering a Tibetan mural
Dear Mark,
As Prof. Salomon already wrote, it is indeed a script very common in 
Nepalese palm-leaf manuscripts (from my experience up to the 15h-16th 
century; it is used also in some earlier Pala manuscripts). The picture 
has a relatively good resolution, but still it is difficult to read the 
first part of the text (it might begin with the ak?aras kama). I believe 
that the last part reads vakaddhitv?d. It is interesting to note that 
many Nepalese scripts were used as ornamental scripts in Tibet, and also 
that the writing material in the depiction seems to be paper (as to be 
expected in Tibet), since the folio bends.
Best wishes,
Camillo Formigatti
