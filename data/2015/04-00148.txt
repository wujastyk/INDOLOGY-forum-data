> We can grant reliability in how the money will be used towards restoration
> of the dilapidated structures. Since Nepal depends to a great extent on
> tourism, we must make sure that this central source of income is guaranteed
> as fast and professionally done as possible. But we also want to make sure
> that the rich local social and ritual life is restored, along with the hope
> thereof, since this will last many years. Moreover, we want to use our
> regional competence to help the Nepali people and their unique heritage.
> And we want you to know that you can trust that the money you donate is
> securely invested.
