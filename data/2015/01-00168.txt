[INDOLOGY] Vedic verse in Ortega y Gasset
27.1.15
George seems to be right. The association with *dh?yo* in the 3rd quarter
cannot escape notice. This might have clinched the issue for the poet.
That could well be intentional. Such hermeneutic value is not uncommon. The
 poet was no Indo-Europeanist. Improvised association helped him. Examples
may be had from improvised etymologies like *m?tar??v? y?d ?mim?ta m?t?ri *(RV
3.29.11) and *t?d ?pnod ?ndro vo yat??s t?sm?d ??po? *(AV? 3.13.2; also AVP)
*.* If the association with *dhiyo* in the 3rd quarter was intentional then
the meaning of *dh?mahi* as intended by the poet himself might require
second thought.
There is another point. Whatever the literal meaning, how a widely known
passage has been received through the millennia deserves some attention. If
I am allowed to draw parallels, a reading though corrupt, when
traditionally accepted over the centuries is retained according to the
text-critical principles emphatically stated by Winternitz and later by
Hoffmann. Indian tradition since Skandasv?min is unanimous in seeing the
*dh?mahi* as *dhy?y?/ema?*. Unfortunately there is no ancient
interpretation as the ?B / Br.U do not give any hint, nor does the Gopatha.
