It is a script of Nepali family. The script name may be 'bhuji mol' bhuji means fly and mol means - head . Head stroke of each letter looks like fly. It is not so clear. Whatever i have understood, sending to you. thanks. 

With best regards,

The picture has a relatively good resolution, but still it is difficult to read the first part of the text (it might begin with the ak?aras kama). I believe that the last part reads vakaddhitv?d. It is interesting to note that many Nepalese scripts were used as ornamental scripts in Tibet, and also that the writing material in the depiction seems to be paper (as to be expected in Tibet), since the folio bends.

Dear Mark,

I don't think there's anything "pseudo-" about this inscription. It looks like script forms seen in old Sanskrit mss. from Nepal, and also resembles Pala-period scripts. A specialist in those areas (which I am not) should be able to confirm this and read it. (The last word is probably svaahaa.)
