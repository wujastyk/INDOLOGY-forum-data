It is a script of Nepali family. The script name may be 'bhuji mol' bhuji means fly and mol means - head . Head stroke of each letter looks like fly. It is not so clear. Whatever i have understood, sending to you. thanks. 
With best regards,

Dear Mark,
I don't think there's anything "pseudo-" about this inscription. It looks like script forms seen in old Sanskrit mss. from Nepal, and also resembles Pala-period scripts. A specialist in those areas (which I am not) should be able to confirm this and read it. (The last word is probably svaahaa.)
