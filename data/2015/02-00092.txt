[INDOLOGY] Two findings related to the history of chess/caturanga
Dear List,
I am glad to inform you that
1?) the "shatranj" and Kerala catura?ga moving of the elephant is well represented in the 9th c. Rudra?a?s K?vy?la?k?ra 5.16, which citra I propose to understand like this (sorry for the squares) :
ye      n?      n?      dh?     n?      v?      dh?     r?
A1      B9      B18   C26    B3     D11    C20    E28
n?      dh?      v?     r?       dh?     r?       r?       jan
B5      C13     D22   E30    C7     E15     E24    F32
ki?     n?      n?      ?a?   n?      ka?    ?a?   te
A17     B25    B2      C10   B19    D27    C4     E12
n?       ?a?    ka?    te      ?am    te       te       ja?
B21     C29     D6      E14    C23   E31     E8     F16
contra Jacobi (1896), Macdonell (JRAS 1898) or Rajendran (1998), but taking into account the "non-chess" understanding of the stanza by Gerow's Glossary of Indian figures of Speech (1971, pp. 180-181) and Lienhard's Classical Poetry (Hist Ind Lit vol. 3,  pp. 144-145), two references kindly drawn to my attention by Alesandro Battistini (Un. La Sapienza, Roma).
2?) Alessandro Battistini has himself found another 9th citra of the horse-moving (in addition to Rudra?a?s K?vy?la?k?ra 5.15 one) : it is Ratn?kara's Haravijaya (*) 43.145-146. I quote him:
 If you construct 145 in this way (I give the correct reading, contained in the footnote), you derive stanza 146 (the so called prast?ra, derived stanza) by moving as a horse on the chessboard. The last syllable of 146 (sit) is left out. I have written in bold the first 4 ak?aras, in order sahas?di). Both the stanzas have their own meaning.
bh?  se    ddh?   ta     tra    ta     na      n? 
s?    di     m?      y?    da    se     vi       t?

s?    r?     hi        ta     sa    mi    dyu     t?
