[INDOLOGY] prof. or mr. or mrs. or ms. etc first name
Dear all,
I'm sure there are others who know more about this than I do, but when I 
was growing up I was told that in the South, people's sir names are 
typically their father's first name. That's how I got my last name, but 
as I was born  in North America where I grew up, it sticks (my son for 
instance has my father's first name as his last name as its my official 
last name).
I'm not sure how common a practice this is, but against this, everyone's 
first name seems like a more respectful thing to call them. The 
alternative is to refer to someone by way of their father, which is 
weird and patriarchal.  I've grown a bit comfortable with it for a 
different reason. My students can't seem to pronounce my last name, but 
are all happy calling me Prof. Shyam (in Toronto!).
Best,
Shyam Ranganathan
