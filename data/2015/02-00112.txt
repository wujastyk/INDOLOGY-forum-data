Dear all,

In preparing the editio princeps of the so called Wright Chronicle, a Chronicle in Nepali translated by Daniel Wright in 1877, we (Manik Bajracharya and me) came across two apparently ?aiva phrases which do not make much sense to us:

This ascetic built another house near the place, invoked Svatantra-m?lam?rti-?rddh?mn?ya and continued to perform the daily worship of Pa?upatin?tha

The ascetic, too, caused the t???amantra together with Mah?k?lokta-agam?rtha-n?tyal?l?-prasann?rtha to be inscribed on the parasol, and this unprecedented parasol was then offered to Pa?upatin?tha.

Can anybody help us in understanding it (better)?

Best,
Axel Michaels
