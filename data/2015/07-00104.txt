Subject: [INDOLOGY] Artificial Neural Network for Sanskrit programming
Message-ID: <CADSGPzUq2n_uJRxci-s+a-v6k3BqJw1J7F48EzUogFjByCOE-w@mail.gmail.com>

Respected scholars,
Recently I have modified one Artificial neural net code for identification
of samAsas in Sanskrit language.
https://github.com/drdhaval2785/SamaasaClassification is the code location.

The results are very encouraging.
Without feeding any rule to the computer, the following is the
classification result

1. Major 5 samAsa types classification - 70%
2. Minor 55 samAsa subtypes classification - 55 %.
3. Major 5 samAsa types classification taking the first two entries - 85 %.

Probability of a fluke would be 1 - 20 %, 2 - 0.2 %, 40 %.

So, the machine learning is statistically significant, if not good enough.


The database which was used was scraped from
http://sanskrit.uohyd.ernet.in/Corpus/SHMT/Samaas-Tagging/ and randomly
shuffled to homogenize the dataset.

The tool was developed for samAsa classification initially, but now
generalized for any string classification problem.

Hope the scholars would like the tool.
