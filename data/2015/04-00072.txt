With regard to "siddha", there is interesting evidence from a tradition far different from the "religious", and that is Kau?ilya's Artha??stra. There the term is used frequently with regard to monetary matters and bookkeeping, but within a religious context we have both siddha used alone and in the compound siddhat?pasa. In these usages, the reference is to a religious virtuoso who is capable of, or believed capable of, doing extraordinary things. See, for example, Artha??stra: 1.11.16; 1.12.22; 1.21.24; 4.3.13, 25, 44; 4.4.3; 5.1.3; 5.2.39, 41.

For j?vanmukta, from a Advaita and quasi-yoga perspective, see Vidy?ra?ya's J?vanmuktiviveda, newly edited and translated by Robert Gooding, available, I think, through the service that publishes dissertations.

Best,

Patrick
