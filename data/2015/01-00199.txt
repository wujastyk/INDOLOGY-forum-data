Dear Dr. Hegarty,

Is it not possible to start with the Tokyo-Kyoto publication (1957) of the
Peking Edition? The Sanskrit names are given in Tibetan transliteration
This is true of the books I consulted. If there is no Sanskrit name (I did
not check) that has to be taken as original.

A low-tech but, perhaps, effective shortcut that might yield result.

Best

DB
