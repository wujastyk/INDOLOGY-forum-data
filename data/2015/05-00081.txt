[INDOLOGY] article wanted
Dear colleagues,
Does anyone have access to the journal with the article noted below 
(page numbers regrettably unknown), which I cannot track down anywhere 
in Britain.  I would very much appreciate firstly confirmation of the 
accuracy of the reference and secondly, if possible, a PDF of the article.
