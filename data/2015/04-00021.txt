[INDOLOGY] Tukaram and the name Tuka
The derivation chukka<s'ukra sounds convincing and compelling in the
interpretation of the idiom chukkeduru. It is an astrological belief that
travelling in the direction facing the planet Venus (which appears similar
to  Moon even in daylight in the sky) leads to reversal of fortune or
misfortune. There is another idiom chukka podduna lEchi. podduna = at the
rise of /in the morning; lEchi =waking up, chukka podduna lEchi =waking up
at the rise of chukka,   Chukka=star does not work here.
chukka = a small drop, dot, star , a dEs'ya (native, not borrowed) word is
well known.
chukka<s'ukra seems to be a tadbhava (Sanskrit/Prakrit-derived) homophonous
with the above dEs'ya word.
