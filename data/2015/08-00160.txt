[INDOLOGY] dates of commentaries on v?ttaratn?kara
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
Hash: SHA1
Bonjour,
I recently found a pdf edition of Kedara's v?ttaratn?kara with four
commentaries at Gretil-e-library.
In this edition, dates of commentaries are not given and I am
wondering if someone here could tell me them.
These commentaries are:
t?tparya??k? by Trivikrama
sukavih?day?nandin? by Sulhana
chandov?tti? by Somacandra?
pa?cik? by R?macandrakavi
I found the date for the first one in  a van Nooten article (around
10th century), but nothing for the others.
Thank you
