R?ja?ekhara, but his ko?a's are lost (9th-10th c.)
Bhoja (11th c.), but the various works he authored were probably composed by others
They are numerous real polygraphs in more recent times, e.g. 
Ved?nta De?ika/Ve?ka?an?tha (13th-14th c.)
Appaya D?k?ita (16th c.)
Melputt?r N?r?ya?a Bha??atiri (16th-17th c.)
R?map??iv?da (18th c.)
N?ge?a Bha??a (18th c.)

> I am looking for Sanskrit authors who have written about many (>=3) different topics or in many (>=3) different genres (e.g., poetry, narrative, philosophical, scientific, ...); alternatively for voluminous texts by one author that cover such different topics in separate chapters (i.e., the thematic strata should be easily separable).

> 2) Texts should not be too short.
> 3) Texts should not be collections of former works or of citations only, but "really" be written by these authors.
> 4) The older, the better!
> 5) Texts should be edited or - even better - already digitized.

> The first (and actually only) author that came to my mind is Kshemendra. Do you have any other ideas? Any feedback is highly appreciated.
