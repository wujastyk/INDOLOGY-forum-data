Hello All,
This seems a typical issue for India. The problem arises because there is no religious studies or Hindu studies conference in India. They just have to go for either Social Science or Science Congress. I think any way they got the attention. Hopefully this translates into Academic study of religion in India.
Thank you all.
Lavanya
