[INDOLOGY] Does anyone know of Sanskrit works that use 2nd-syllable rhyming?
Among the most popular pieces of poems -- often selected for recitation by
children -- is the ?ivat???avastotra, ascribed to R?va?a, which rhymes its
second syllables up to the 14th that is the last-but-one verse. Its date is
not known but could be anterior to the emergence of Vai??avism as a strong
contender against ?aivism which could be prior to the ninth century CE. But
that is uncertain.
