[INDOLOGY] Sources for verses on fate/karma
Dear Martin,
Regarding your third verse:
n?bhukta? k??yate karma kalpako?i?atair api |
ava?yam eva bhoktavya? k?ta? karma ?ubh??ubham ||
You are no doubt aware of a similar verse that is found in a number of
Buddhist texts. An early source for it has recently been published, from
which I here quote it:
na pra?a?yanti karm??i kalpako?i?atair api |
s?magr?? pr?pya k?la? ca phalanti khalu dehin?? ||
This is from the *Dhanap?lakavaineyas**?tra*, published in *A Unique
Collection of Twenty S**?tras in a Sanskrit Manuscript from the Potala*,
editions and translation by Bhik?u?? Vin?t?, vol. I,2, p. 692 (Sanskrit
Texts from the Tibetan Autonomous Region, no. 7/2. Beijing -- Vienna: China
Tibetology Publishing House, Austrian Academy of Sciences Press, 2010).
While this does not answer your question, I thought it worthwhile to cite
this recently available old source for the similar Buddhist verse.
Best regards,
