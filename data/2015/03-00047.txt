Dear all,

Accommodation if required can be booked directly by participants at Luther King House within easy access of the university by bus or a 20 minute walk -http://www.lutherkinghouse.co.uk/ <http://www.lutherkinghouse.co.uk/> - or there are many other places in Manchester if you prefer.
 
The programme as ever looks exciting and papers are precirculated so there is plenty of time for discussion.  We look forward to seeing you there.  Jackie Hirst
