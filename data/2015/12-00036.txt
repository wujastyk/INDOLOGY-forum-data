As Dominik kindly pointed out the text is in the Muktabodha digital library.
www.muktabodha.org and then click on digital library tab.
The digital library page will then come up.
There are three collections accessable from this page.
It is in the "Searchable E-text Library" collection.
To prevent automated web-crawlers copying the texts username/password
protection has been placed on the collection.
