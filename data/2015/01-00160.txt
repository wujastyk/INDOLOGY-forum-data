[INDOLOGY] Iti praancah
Dear Manu,
I?m glad you asked! 
The earliest available Tamil grammatical work, Tolkappiyam, is loaded with the phrase ?e?ma??r pulavar (???????? ??????).? Other significant phrases in this context are ?e?pa ci?antici??r? (???? ?????????????),? ?e?ma??r pulamaiy?r? (???????? ?????????),? ?mo?ima??r pulavar (????????? ??????),? ?e?pa v?ymo?i-p pulavar (???? ????????????????),? ?e?a mo?ipa y?ppu a?i pulavar (?? ????? ?????? ??? ??????),? ?e?a mo?ital pulavar ??? (?? ??????? ?????? ???),? ?? col iyal pulavar ? e?pa (? ???? ?????????? ? ????), ?n?l navil pulavar nuva??u a?aintanar? (???? ????? ?????? ??????? ?????????),? ? so on and so forth. 
[The auto-fill feature renders ?pullover? for ?pulavar,? and I?ve tried to rectify it. So, if you see "pullover,? please decode it to mean ?pulavar.? Thanks!]
Commentaries on grammars take this gesture further and make explicit statements about variances.

p.s. The point is that acknowledging earlier scholarship was ethical and normal (unlike in modern Google copy/paste technology and plagiarism) in traditional scholarly texts.
