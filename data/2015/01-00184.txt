[INDOLOGY] Chapters from Ritual, State and History in South Asia
Dear Colleagues:
Does anyone have pdf copies of these two chapters, both from the same 
edited volume? I know I have hard copies somewhere, but I can't find 
them (I do see a readable copy online, but I need hard copies of the 
chapters and the volume is proving difficult to inter-library loan [it's 
also selling for near $600 on Amazon, so I won't be buying a copy for my 
library in the near future]).
