Dear Colleagues,

Apparently the image did not come through with my original mailing. Thanks to those of you who have alerted me to this and to those who have offered valuable help on the basis of the verbal description.  I am attaching the image again, this time in  a smaller format in the hopes that you will be able to see it.  Thanks again for you help and advice. 

Best.
