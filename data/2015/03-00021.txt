[INDOLOGY] Ayurvedic query
Dear all,
there is also a Kew general botanical index (I have the URL at home, cannot give it now) which I have found very useful. Quite many colleagues (e.g. R. Syed) have used Roxburgh flora, although it is, of course, wholly anticipated (publ. 1820-24). I do not, but as my brother as a professional botanist says, this is acceptable, when clearly announced and consistently done ? then it is always possible to find the valid games. A further problem is that there are many cases where a simple X = Y does not work. When the plant X is Y in the north, it may also be Z in the south and so on. And this depends on (supposed or real) similar medical properties, not on any botanical affinity.
Best
