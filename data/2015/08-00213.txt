[INDOLOGY] Princess Niwal Dai - a query
Dear Colleagues,
Sir Richard Temple published the legend of Niwal Dai ("as sung by two
scavengers from Bibiyal village near Ambala") in the 1st Volume of his
monumental The Legends of the Punjab (1882, pp. 418-528; reprint 1962,
Language Department, Punjab, Patiala).
I am not aware of any work devoted to this legend. Am I right in suspecting
that this text has not aroused interest among Indian folklore specialists?
Is there, by any chance, a new - and possible richer - version of the text?
Hindi? Panjabi? A new translation?
Yours sincerely,
