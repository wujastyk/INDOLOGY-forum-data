[INDOLOGY] Call for Papers - IIGRS 7 (Leiden University)
Thanks for this initiative. It seems that Indological research here is defined exclusively in terms of the study of texts ? or is the exclusion of the study of Hindu, Buddhist or Jaina art and archaeology, to mention just some forms of not primarily textual research that I would consider Indological, not intended? If it is intentional, are inscriptions considered to be texts, or do you mean only transmitted texts? I was about to forward the announcement to a number of French graduate students when I noticed the limitation to "texts". Please clarify.
