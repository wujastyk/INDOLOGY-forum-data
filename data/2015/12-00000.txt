The Akan????u is the longest collection in the Tamil Sangam anthologies. 
It is one of the seminal works of classical India and contains poems 
that are among the finest ever written in India or anywhere else. The 
aim of this translation is to make the Akan????u accessible to readers 
who know English. It strives for scrupulous accuracy while keeping the 
felicity and poetic quality of the original.
The Akan????u provides an account of the daily life of people of its 
times, one more detailed than any others that are available to us. Its 
poets were able to imbue virtually every poem with life by their 
striking use of images, their use of suggestion, their often uncanny 
sense of the feelings of the characters they portray, their intricate 
descriptions of flora and fauna, and their evocation of places, 
personages and events. Their use of imagery can be striking and sublime, 
but even more, their evocation of life 2000 years ago in all its aspects 
rings true. They left behind a world that lives and breathes, one that, 
through their poems, we can enter and experience as if it were our own.
