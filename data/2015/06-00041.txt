I think Dilip Chakrabarty is actually thinking about racism from a totally
different angle. What is racist is the notion that 'aryans'--the speakers
of Old Indo-Aryan, or what have you--originated within the subcontinent,
and that they predate and include the Indus Valley Civilization. Bharadvaj
clearly wants to demonstrate that the composers of the Vedas were
indigenous, and of an antiquity greater than the Indus Valley Civilization.
This is racist on many levels. 1. There is a cultural chauvinism that
anything good must originate in the womb of Bharata M?t? 2. Bharadvaj wants
to say that the Indus Valley Civilization emerged from the Vedic culture,
when in fact the IVC was a highly developed civilization, of greater
antiquity than the Veda, which did not speak an Indo-Aryan or Indo-European
language. To attribute the IVC cultural achievements to the speakers of
Vedic is extremely racist and chauvinistic.
