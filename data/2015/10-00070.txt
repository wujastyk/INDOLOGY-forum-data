[INDOLOGY] PDF request
Dear friends of Indology-list,
Could anyone help me to find a pdf copy of:
Singh, G.P. 2008. *Research Into the History and Civilization of the
Kiratas*. New Delhi: Gyan Publishing House.
(I wasn't able to find in Italy)
and/or the email contact of professor G.P. Singh, which I was not able to
find on the Manipur University web-site. He (should) teaches in the
Department of History but there is anyone with this name.
Best,
Paolo
