   detail)
The Wellcome Trust is offering bursaries of ?5,000-?25,000 to support
people who wish to visit London and work on items in the Wellcome Library.
Bear in mind, the Wellcome Library has one of the largest collections of
South Asian manuscripts outside India.  It includes Sanskrit, Prakrit,
Pali, Sinhalese, Tibetan and other materials in large numbers, and quite a
lot of it not yet explored or exploited.
The 2015 application deadlines are *1 April* and *1 October*.
These bursaries would pay for someone to visit the Wellcome Library to work
on its collections.  The Wellcome Library is also just a few minutes walk
from the British Library, SOAS, the Warburg Institute and other academic
resources in Bloomsbury.  It is an hour by train to either Cambridge or
Oxford.
