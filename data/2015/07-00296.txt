1) From the ?????????

???? ??????? ?????? ????? ????? ??????? ???????? ???

???? ???????? ?????? ???????????? ????????????? ?????????? ??. ??-??-? ?

This is ?????? ??????? (embedding the name of the metre in the verse). Also
note the beauty that is obtained with the two parts of a foot beginning
with the same consonant, i.e. the first and seventh syllables of each foot
begin with the same consonant (???? and ??????, ????? and ??????, ???? and
??????, ????? and ??????).

2) Nineteen verses from the twentieth canto of ?????????????????? (??-?? to
??-??), here I produce the last one ?

???????????????????????????????????????????

????????????????? ?????? ??????????? ??????????? ??-?? ?

Once again, ?????? ??????? (embedding the name of the metre in the verse)
is present with the name ?????????. Also, both parts of each foot begin
with the same consonant (???- and ??????-, ???- and ???-, ???- and ?????, ???
and ?????). All other 18 verses follow the same pattern of first and
seventh syllable of each quarter beginning with the same consonant.
