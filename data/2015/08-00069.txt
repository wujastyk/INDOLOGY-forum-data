[INDOLOGY] (no subject)
  Sir,
        I have been interacting in  Indology list for the last few years. However,of late,I find that my mails are reaching the receipents but  i am not getting the feedback. which I was getting  a few weeks back. I would like to know whether It is technical snag  or if I am running short of complying with some formalities ?
