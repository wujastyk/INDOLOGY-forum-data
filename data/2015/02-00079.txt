[INDOLOGY] Examples of very ambiguous devanagari Sanskrit	sentences
Let's fix the earliest date when avagraha made appearance.
Randomly picking up my manuscript copies shows that avagraha was prevalent
in 1574 vikrama saMvat (around 1497-98 AD roughly) for sure. So, it is not
too modern a phenomenon.
References with evidence pointing to a still earlier date is welcome.
Please find attached the manuscript page with colophon.
See third line ??????????.
Also see the use of avagraha to do vicCeda of sandhi in the commentary
above the verse lines.
