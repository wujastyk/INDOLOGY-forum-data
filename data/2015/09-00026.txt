[INDOLOGY] Fwd: Re:  early mathematics
The /Sa?khy?parim??a /might be worth a look.  It was the source of H. T. 
Colebrooke's essay "On weights and measures" (/Asiatic Researches/ 6, 
1798, 91?109, repr. in his /Miscellaneous Essays, /1873 ed., 2, 157?170; 
omitted in the original edition, 1837).  Colebrooke's MS of this text is 
in the former India Office collections, Eggeling, no. 5513).
