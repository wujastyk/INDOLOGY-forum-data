[INDOLOGY] Article about the politics surrounding Indology at	the IHRC
Yet I still think it's correct to call Hindutva and Bharavaj's project
racist, albeit implicitly and convolutedly so, because there is an implicit
judgment of racial superiority. And chauvinism/triumphalism rarely come in
some kind of pure form, free of a racist sediment. Explicit racism is
highly tolerated in right-wing political/academic circles in India today as
you all know. It might be a more confusing type of racism for us to
disentangle because it is not as black and white, involving complex
judgments about people's origins via caste, language, and way of life etc.
But racism is very real both in life and "scholarship".
