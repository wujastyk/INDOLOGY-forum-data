[INDOLOGY] Importance of avritti
I couldn?t locate/download the 'H.P.Sastri?s English translation of Anandabhatta?s Vallalacarita' from the given link. 
However, here are my thoughts which may or may not fit here. 
1. I find a distant parallel in the Tamil Tolkappiyam to the nine distinguishing criteria of kula of the Kulinas enumerated in the ?Vallalacarita." The Tolkappiyam enumerates 9 qualities/characteristics to be compatible in people who choose their life partners: pi?appu, ku?imai, ??mai, ???u, ? k?ma v?yil, ni?ai, aru?, u?arvu, thiru
2. One of the eight types of marriages referred in the Tamil text i?aiya??r ka?aviyal is pirac?pattiyam (== prajapatya). I find a similarity here between the concept of avritti and the concept of pirac?pattiyam. The code of pirac?pattiyam is that if/when a brother-in-law of the same ?gotra? requests for a girl/bride, the girl?s relatives should give away that girl in acceptance of the marriage. I vaguely remember reading somewhere that the purpose of this type of marriage (prajapatya) was to procreate.
I?d like to learn more from members on this list.

Rajam
