Subject: [INDOLOGY] Infinity Chair at Harvard
Message-ID: <BLU437-SMTP2878D7AD7D245ABF442139BF870@phx.gbl>

Dear all,
I don't wish to enter the debate re. Malhotra's alleged plagiarism of Andrew Nicholson,
whose book was sent to me for review. Sorry I didn't write one!
But I wonder if anyone could clarify what happened to the Infinity Foundation chair
at Harvard. It seems to have functioned only two years, 2001-2003. Why didn't it continue?
Does anyone know the reason for this?
Best to all
Stella Sandahl
