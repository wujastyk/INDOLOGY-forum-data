Manu,

Pope?s Tamil Hand-Book (2nd ed., 1859), p. 18, gives a useful list of such symbols used in ?Cutchery Tamil? of the colonial period, but I do not find your symbol among them.  I attach the relevant page.

Best,

Tim

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Tamil currency symbol

Dear Colleagues,

In one of the Tamil manuscripts I am working on, I have found the mention of a price.
This currency is expressed by a symbol (see attached images).
I guess this symbol means "rupee", but I am not sure.
Has any of you ever seen such a symbol?
Or could direct me towards any source illustrating currency symbols used in Tamil and/or Indian manuscripts/inscriptions?

With many thanks in advance.
