Dear List,
I will be very much thankful if any of you would like to kindly share with me a PDF of the following work.
K.A. Subramania IYER (ed.) 1973. V?kyapad?ya of Bhart?hari: with the Prak?r?akaprak??a of Hel?r?ja. K???a III, part ii. Poona : Deccan College.
*Please note that I am looking for Part ii of the third K???a.
The only copy at the Oriental Institute, Oxford is now misplaced, as I was told. Thank you very much for any help in advance.
Best Wishes,
R
