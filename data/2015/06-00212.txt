Dear Dominik, and List,

Yes, it is easy to filter things out.  I do that by not reading them.  But
if we publish on this list things that are not competent we give them an
air of competence that they don't deserve.  Right?

Hans's recent note also makes the point.  This is not good scholarship.

Best wishes,

George
