I am going to present a paper entitled ?From Priestess to Performers: Changes in Women?s Roles in Tamil Temples? at the SARII-SMU conference on October 10 in Dallas. See http://www.sarii.org/temples.html <http://www.sarii.org/temples.html> . My paper will trace the historical transition from non-brahmin female priests through brahmin female priests to brahmin male priests in the Tamil country. (Misunderstanding of the role and status of the female priests in the ancient Tamil culture has led to misinterpreting these priests as untouchables.)

The Tamil epic, the Cilappatik?ram, translated by R. Parthasarathy (The Cilappatikaram of Ilarilco Atikal: An Epic of South India. New York: Columbia University Press, 1993) may be very useful in this regard. See cantos 12 and 30 and the long postscript which refers to other works such as those by Obeyesekere.
