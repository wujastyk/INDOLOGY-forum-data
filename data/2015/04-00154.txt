[INDOLOGY] access
While going through Ganguly?s translation of Virata Parva, I was suddenly unable to access the various chapters. Now when I try to access sacred-texts.com <http://sacred-texts.com/> I get this message:
Forbidden
You do not have permission to access this document.
Web Server at sacred-texts.com <http://sacred-texts.com/>
Help would be greatly appreciated.
