Dear All,
I would highly appreciate if someone can share with me a handy digital
edition of the Ny?yas?trav?rtika of Uddyotakara? Since I am travelling I
don't have access to my hard drives and the Thakur's edition available on
DLI seems difficult to download at the moment.
Thanks very much in advance.
Yours,
Mrinal Kaul
