Dear Patrick,

you find mentioned the seven ?g?tik?ni? for instance in the Dattilam:
approx. verses 160-233.

See also the English translation  of the Dattilam by Te Nijenhuis  p.
420-421.

The ?g, G?th? etc. are mentioned in the NATyazAstra.

The passage is quoted in:

A History of Indian Literature: Scientific and technical literature

 Di Emmie te Nijenhuis?,   p. 7?.



Yours,

Alessandra.
