[INDOLOGY] Query
I turn to the pa??itapari?ad to educate me in what look like technical terms from the science of music. Curiously, in the Y?j?avalkya Sm?ti (3.112?116) there is a passage about how a person proficient in music and singing can attain the highest Brahman. Why this passage is there to begin with is obscure to me. But at verse 113 we have the mention of seven ?g?tik?ni?:  Apar?ntaka, Ullopya, Madraka, Prakar?, Auve?aka, Sarobindu, and Uttara 
Then at 114 it says that these should be sung (probably some kinds of chants: ?g, G?th?, (or ?gg?th?) P??ik?, Dak?avihit?, and Brahmag?tik?.
Vi?var?pa has this comment:  im?ny apar?ntak?d?ni . . . sapta g?tik?ni g?na??str?d ev?vasey?ni. A hint as to where these come from, but not helpful beyond that. 
Apar?rka, a bit more helpfully: apar?ntik?dayo bh?rata??strokt? g?taprak?ravi?e?? brahmaj??n?bhy?sahetor gey??.
Thank you all for any leads or explanations on this.
