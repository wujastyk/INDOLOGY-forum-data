I came across this purported nirukta of the word "ka?m?ra" on the 
Wikipedia page for "Kashmir" -- does anyone know where it comes from? -- :

    The Nilamata Purana describes the Valley's origin from the waters,
    Ka means "water" and Shimir means "to desiccate". Hence, Kaashmir
    stands for "a land desiccated from water." There is also a theory
    which takes Kaashmir to be a contraction of Kashyap-mira or
    Kashyapmir or Kashyapmeru, the "sea or mountain of Kashyapa", the
    sage who is credited with having drained the waters of the
    primordial lake Satisar, that Kaashmir was before it was reclaimed.

I checked the N?lamata Pur?na, which has this:

    ka? praj?patir uddi??a? ka?yapa? ca praj?pati? |
    ten?sau nirmito de?a? ka?m?r?khyo bhavi?yati || 231 ||
    ka? v?ri hari?? yasm?d de??d asm?d ap?k?tam |
    ka?m?r?khya? tato pa?ya n?ma loke bhavi??ati || 232 ||


source:

This explains the "ka" as water (v?ri), but doesn't have anything to say 
about "shimir". The R?jatara?gi?? has, similarly:

    ka?yapena tadanta?sta? gh?tayitv? jalodbhavam |
    nirmame tatsarobh?mau ka?m?r? iti ma??alam || 27 ||


source: 
https://archive.org/stream/TheRajataranginiOfKalhanaVol3/The%20Rajatarangini%20of%20Kalhana%20-%20Vol%201#page/n7/mode/2up

Neither source seems to have anything to say about the second half of 
the word "ka?m?ra" meaning something like "desiccated". Does anyone have 
any idea where this might come from?

Thanks,

Charles
