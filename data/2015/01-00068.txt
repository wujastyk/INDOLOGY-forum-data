[INDOLOGY] Buhler's Indian Paleography
Dear All,
A couple of years ago I scanned the tables in B?hler's Paleography and 
turned them into an HTML-based resource (except the plate with numerals 
which I never got to finish).
Since the zip file has proven too large to send directly to the list, I 
have uploaded it to google drive. You should be able to download it 
using the link below:

Save, unzip to a folder and start by launching index.html. See the file 
readme.txt for instructions. It should work on any operating system and 
any browser that is not very outdated.
I hope some of you find this little utility helpful; someone out there 
might even improve it.
All the best,
Daniel
