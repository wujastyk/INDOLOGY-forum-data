[INDOLOGY] Religious Literature with Political Purposes
exchange involving the "class" and the "non-class", emulations and
incorporations.
Why by now? When processes such as Sanskritization were being discussed,
the opposite direction processes were also being discussed just along side.
So the bidirectional view was always there. But the explanations such as
Sanskritization were focussed on one of the directions within the
bidirectional complex.
But what probably are new are approaches such as "third cultures"  (Useem,
John, Ruth Hill Useem, and John Donoghue (1963). "Men in the Middle of the
Third Culture: The Roles of American and Non-Western People in
Cross-Cultural Administration," *Human Organization ), (*Useem, John
(1971). "The Study of Cultures." Originally published in* Sociological
Focus; *reprinted in *Studies of Third Cultures: A Continuing Series, *No.
6. East Lansing: Institute for International Studies in Education, Michigan
State University, no date.*)*
This approach is being looked at as "  a radical democratic political
theory which goes beyond both traditional liberalism and Marxism" (*The
Concept of "Third Cultures" in Intercultural Ethics *- Richard Evanoff
, *Eubios
Journal of Asian and International Bioethics* 10 (2000), 126-129. )
Can we see puranic/agamic etc. as "third cultures" emerging as a result of
intercultural interactions between Vedic and folk , Vedic and tribal etc. ?
