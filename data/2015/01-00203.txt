James,

For the two Tibetan imperial-era catalogs (early 9th to mid-9th centuries),
see:

Die Lhan kar ma: Ein fruher Katalog der ins Tibetische ubersetzten
buddhistischen Texte. Kritische Neuausgabe mit Einleitung und Materialien
by by Adelheid Herrmann-Pfandt. She includes references to the Karchag
Phangthangma (dkar-chag 'Phang-thang-ma) (abbreviation is ?Pha?).

For a little bit later source (late 13th century), see An Early Tibetan
Survey of Buddhist Literature: The Bstan pa rgyas pa rgyan gyi nyi ?od of
Bcom Idan ral gri, edited by Kurtis R. Schaeffer and Leonard W. J. van der
Kuijp.
Best,
Warner
