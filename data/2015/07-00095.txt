[INDOLOGY] Amartya Sen and Nalanda
think anyone knows anything about how 'students' were granted 'admission'
to 'study' at Nalanda. The entire presentation of Nalanda as a 'university'
with 'students' who come to 'study' there is, to my mind, fantastical.
Is not the office of intellectually high-ranking dv?rap?las, who were to
decide about admission to Buddhist centres of learning of the N?land?
calibre,  mentioned in foreign pilgrims' accounts ? Their function would
have been to test the mental skills of aspirants. I have only a very faint
memory, certainly dating back more than thirty years, of having read about
that in Chinese and/or Tibetan accounts. I am almost sure that for instance
??ntarak?ita, too, did hold such a position. Unless the function of a
monastic dv?rap?la was not entirely different from the one I am (hopefully
correctly) recalling, it was probably an office of such a kind Sen might
have borne in mind when writing about "entry qualifications".
