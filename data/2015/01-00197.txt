Dear colleagues,

I am happy to announce the following event to be held at the  
University of Toronto:

Shaivism and the Tantric Traditions. A Symposium in Honour of Alexis G.
J. S. Sanderson, March 26-28, 2015.

The academic study of "Tantrism" has blossomed in recent decades. Once  
dismissed as marginal, or unworthy of serious attention, we now  
understand the study of Asia's Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain esoteric or  
tantric religious traditions to be integral to the religious and  
cultural landscapes of medieval South, Southeast, Central and East  
Asia. This shift is reshaping the historiography of medieval India is  
in no small measure due to the major contributions of Alexis  
Sanderson, Spalding Professor of Eastern Religions and Ethics at  
Oxford University. The symposium, to be held at the University of
Toronto, with Sanderson in attendance, seeks to honour and engage with  
his scholarship on the eve of his retirement.
