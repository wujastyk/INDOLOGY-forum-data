[INDOLOGY] Query: Date of the Bhagavatam
Hi George,
See an article I wrote in the Journal of Vaishnava Studies 11:1 Fall
(2002): 51-80, (which also summarized all the dating attempts known to me
at the time ).  As for Hardy's thesis of a Southern provenance and date
based on the Alvars, if I am not mistaken Vasudha Narayanam has critiqued
that, so perhaps you can get a reference to her review.
Best wishes,  EB
