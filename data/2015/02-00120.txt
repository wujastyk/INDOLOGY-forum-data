Dear All,

we hear from Kerala that in March and April another two Vedic rituals will be performed by local Nambudiri Brahmins.

We must thank the late Frits Staal for having drawn international attention to them in 1975 and for having spurred local interest as well.
Now we have one such major ritual almost every year. As he himself said shortly before his passing: 

"Atiratrams cannot be stopped now so let us celebrate that as well." 
 
This year there will be a 12 day Atir?tra Agnicayana  ("Athiraathram"), at Edappal in Central Kerala, starting March 20th.
Different from the 2011 Panjal one it will be in the ??val?yana tradition. 

Then there will be an Agni??oma (Soma) ritual, again at  Edappal, on April 20. However it will be celebrated in the Kau??taki style.

Please direct any inquiries to  T. P. Mahadevan, teepee43 at yahoo.com.

Jayantu yaj?akarm??i !

Michael
