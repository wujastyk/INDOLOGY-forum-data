But what can the ?powder of his arrows? be ?  Is there some arcanum of dhanu??stra that could explain this ? Or does the poet invite us to imagine simply that some clay or power was used to mark the name of the king upon the arrows that were then fired off by K?madeva ?  >>>

In Tamil, ezutu (?????-) means "to paint", which later on also came to be employed as "characters" (=ezuttu, ???????). There is a Prabandha genre called "MaDal Urtal" in which the hero rides a palmyrah horse, holding the painting of the heroine who refuses to marry, thus making their love public. The painting on palmyrah leaf-fan is called "paTam ezutu-tal". A famous TirukkuRaL is:

> Until now, three palm species are employed for writing/incising in south India (Borassus flabellifer, Corypha umbraculifera, Corypha utan). In Tamil, their names are panai, tALip panai & cItALi. cItALIp panai lives 100+ years, flowers only once and then dies; this sri-tALi palm is represented in Indus valley tablets also. Like kAz "black" becomes kAla "yama" & paza "fruit" > phala in Sanskrit, tAzai becomes tAla 'palms'. These palm leaves are treated with turmeric powder. tAzai is common name for palms and pandanus in Tamil. In Telugu and further north, tAzai is cognate with tADi "toddy" palm.

Even the bronze age writing of symbols in Indus valley should have started like this on leaves of pandanus, palms and cotton cloth. W. A. Fairservis' book shows how the famous fish symbol comes from painting.
