(ll. 3-4). From the name of the sanctuary, it comes from the city of
al-?uqqa north of Sanaa. It is not possible to determine the length of the
lacuna on the top and the bottom of the text, whereas on the right only few
letters should be missing (about two). The text should date around the end
of 1st c. BC to 2nd c. AD. Finally, it is interesting because only a few
bronze plaques have been found with dedication to Ta?lab, and none to T?lb
of Qdmn ?-Dmhn.
Al-Jallad adds that since it seems to have been unpublished, the chances
that it are fake are very small --i.e., it is not likely to be a copy of a
known object.
