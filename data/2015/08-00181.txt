Subject: [INDOLOGY] twenty-four buddhas/jinas - artistic evidence?
Message-ID: <41EFB2F6-5F05-4EC2-8CA9-171B21A81893@ed.ac.uk>

Dear colleagues,

I am exploring the parallel notions of twenty-four past buddhas and twenty-four past jinas/tirthankaras. I have all the textual references and scholarly materials, as far as I am aware, but I lack expertise in the artistic sources. Does anybody know when or where we find the first appearance of twenty-four buddhas or jinas together? (I am aware of evidence for smaller numbers of past teachers in art from the Ashokan period onwards, but I am particularly interested in when the number 24 makes an appearance.)

In addition, is the number 24 at all significant in Vaisnava traditions? I am aware of the list of 24 avat?ras in the Sikh Dasam Granth.

Many thanks as always for your help.

All the best,
Naomi
