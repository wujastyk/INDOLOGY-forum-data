[INDOLOGY] twenty-four buddhas/jinas - artistic evidence?
Dear colleagues,
I am exploring the parallel notions of twenty-four past buddhas and twenty-four past jinas/tirthankaras. I have all the textual references and scholarly materials, as far as I am aware, but I lack expertise in the artistic sources. Does anybody know when or where we find the first appearance of twenty-four buddhas or jinas together? (I am aware of evidence for smaller numbers of past teachers in art from the Ashokan period onwards, but I am particularly interested in when the number 24 makes an appearance.)
In addition, is the number 24 at all significant in Vaisnava traditions? I am aware of the list of 24 avat?ras in the Sikh Dasam Granth.
Many thanks as always for your help.
All the best,
Naomi
