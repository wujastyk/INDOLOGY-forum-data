[INDOLOGY] Does anyone know of Sanskrit works that use 2nd-syllable	rhyming?
Dear Dominic, 
As for the use of 2nd-syllable rhyming, I?d refer you to the Stuti-vidy?, a work traditionally ascribed to Samantabhadra, but this must be a different one than the author of the ?pta-m?m??s? etc. (see http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10781-014-9270-3), and lived well after 650.
This Jaina work was most probably composed in the South (Karnataka), however, it draws also from North Indian Jaina sources. 
The edition: 
Pann?l?l Jain (ed., Hindi transl.); Jugal Ki?or Mukht?r ?Yugav?ra? (Introduction): ?r?mat-sv?mi-Samantabhadr?c?rya-viracit? Stuti-vidy? (Jina-?ataka) [Samantabhadra-bh?rat?k? eka a?ga] ?r?-Vasunandy-?c?rya-k?ta sa?sk?ta-??k?se ala?k?ta tath? hind?anuv?da se yukta. C?ra-sev?-mandir, Saras?v? Jil? Sah?ranpur 1950.
