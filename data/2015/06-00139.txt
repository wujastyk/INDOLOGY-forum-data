[INDOLOGY] Article about the politics surrounding indology at	the IHRC
Whoever has asked you to be more specific probably did not know that I
hardly understand or pay attention to any of these specifics.
I admit that I need to learn these cultural details in case by any chance I

In any case, I appreciate the efforts. Sorry for being ignorant in these
matters.
