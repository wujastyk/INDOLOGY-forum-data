Dear Roelf,

I would say it's Durga.
Enlarging the photograph you can see a number of plaques among the offerings. They bear the canonic image of Durga sitting on her lion, alongside with the canonic inscriptions in Hindi: mAtA rAnI kA SR~NgAr (the love of the Goddess).

Best,
Dr. Marina V. Orelskaya

 Dear?INDOLOGY?members,
 Can anybody tell
 us the name of the deity on the attached photograph, and the
 festive occasion for which the offerings have been prepared
 (also taking the month of the year into
 account)?
 The photograph
 was taken in New Delhi, India, March 2007.
 
 The offerings
 include pottery with sprouted Barley (Hordeum
 vulgare), a decorated coconut (Cocos nucifera)
 and flowers of several plants.?
 
 Sprouting barley
 has also been documented in Calcutta (november 2014), where
 it is offered for sale as germinated grain and as seedlings
 in pottery, similar to the one on the photo.
 
 I am asking
 this question on behalf of the author of the photograph,
 Ren? Cappers. He is currently preparing a book on
 traditional agriculture practices and food
 preparation.
 
 With kind regards and thanks in advance for your help,
 
 Roelf
