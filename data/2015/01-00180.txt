Subject: [INDOLOGY] Catalogue of tantric mss at the SBL in Varanasi?
Message-ID: <20150128160020.1bn7awlg08swccoo@webmail2.abo.fi>


Dear members,

Does anyone have an electronic version of the catalogue(s) of the SBL  
in Varanasi of their Tantric mss? The Digital Library of India has  
some volumes, but not these ones. I would be most grateful for any help.

Sincerely,
M?ns Broo
