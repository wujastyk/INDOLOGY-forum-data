Despite my profound agreement with Dominik on the great good that Indology has done, I struggle with the statement below, since it seems to claim for all Indologists at all times a moral and methodological purity that history clearly belies. Please note that Al Collins said ?at times?, a phrase that leaves open and debatable the frequency and severity of problems within Indology. 

Best,
Howard
