[INDOLOGY] Fwd: Article about the politics surrounding Indology at the IHRC
Re: [INDOLOGY] Article about the politics surrounding Indology at
the IHRC
Prof. Paturi, Kind sir, 1. I only wished to point out that the IVC was a
distinct civilization from the speakers of Old Indo- Aryan. I did not mean
better, just technologically more advanced, and distinct. This are facts
that need not contain any additional value judgment. 2. I know that IVC
seals have not been deciphered, but simply wished to point out that in all
probability, in the opinion of most experts, they did not speak an
Indo-European or Indo-Aryan language. The only people who believe otherwise
are the true racists and chauvinists, the Hindutva morons who sadly are in
a position of great power in your country today.
So I would recommend that, in a spirit of intellectual integrity and calm,
you try to discern the intent of someone's comments, before you start using
heated language, and calling people racists and chauvinists.
Good day,J
