This since B?hler's detailed analysis of the N?lamata in his famous Kashm?r
report of 1877 well-known desiccation myth simply provided a background for
"Nirvacananists" in search for a meaning like "water-draining-away" in the
syllables *ka-?m?-ra*. The N?lamata reference with *ka *(n.) as "water" may
tacitly presuppose on what Govind Kaul elaborated more extensively later in
the 19th century. See his *R?jatara?gi??prade?avy?khy? *(MS Stein No. 128,
Clauson's Catalogue [1912] p. 598). There, he explains the nirukti in the
context of Kashmir's "second name", Sat?saras, in the following manner: *ka?
*[=] jala?, *?m?rati *[=] calaty asm?d iti *?m?ra sm?ra* calane iti dh?tor
au??dika? r?pam. Thereafter he quotes your  N?lamata passage, incidentally
using the notable variant *halin? *instead of *hari??* (cp. the apparatus
in De Vreese's ed.).
Thus by a forced u??di derivation two nominal stems *?m?ra / sm?ra* were
made up assigning to it the meaning of the verbal root *cal*. This could
very well represent an older tradition. Anyway, following Kaul's etymology,
*ka-?m?ra* would eventually come to mean "[land]
from-where-the-water-drained-away".
In this manuscript, Govind Kaul explains also the etymologies of the name
Kashmir in the Ka?m?r? (*ka??ra, ka?ur, ka??r*) and Persian (*ka?yapamar,
ka?mar*) languages.
