Subject: [INDOLOGY] Prophets Facing Backwards
Message-ID: <CAKdt-Cc0XRiFs9hYL8miBDpya4k3YCbfWr6xTFS8XsUpCTX8pQ@mail.gmail.com>

?Meera Nanda has just uploaded the full text of her 2003 book *Prophets
Facing Backwards* <https://www.academia.edu/11586065/> to her Academia.edu
page.?  If you don't know it, and are interested in contemporary debates
about Hindu fundamentalism, I recommend it.  It is controversial, and Meera
herself has taken public positions on issues like the Yoga Wars that have
encouraged many and made her the target of others.

Best,
Dominik Wujastyk
