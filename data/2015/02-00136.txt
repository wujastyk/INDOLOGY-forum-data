Dear list members,


A history student from Delhi (JNU) presently in Leiden is writing a paper on v?stu??stras as a source of historical studies. I want her at least to know of the ideas such as expressed by Vincent Lef?vre, in his book Commanditaires & artistes en Indu du Sud. Des Pallava aux N?yak (VI-XVIII si?cle). Paris 2006, pp. 95-107 regarding the practical use (or rather, the absence of that) of such texts for the artisans and craftsmen: Briefly, the texts were mainly concerned with rituals; whatever practical information on construction etc. which is there, is there as a by-product of the ritual interest. If artisans refer to these texts they do so to enhance their status.

Unfortunately, the student does not read French. I hope that some of the members of this list are able to suggests some publications in English which deal with these matters.

With kind regards, Herman Tieken
