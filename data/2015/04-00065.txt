Dear Friends,
I am seeking clarification on the following terms.
Are the terms s*iddha *and *j?vanmukta* synonymous?
If someone is considered to be a siddha, does that imply that they are
'liberated in this lifetime'?
Does anyone know of any discussion that explicitly links these terms?
All the best,
