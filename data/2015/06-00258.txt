[INDOLOGY] Fun media piece about the Mitanni: Sanskrit in Ancient	Syria
Good fun because it has these interesting combinations:
1. These charioteers spoke the same language and recited the same hymns
that would later on be *complied* into the *Rig Veda* by their comrades who
had ventured east. (highlighting mine)
and
The group that went east and later on *composed* the *Rig Veda *(highlighting
mine)
Compiled or composed?
2. The group that went east and later on composed the *Rig Veda*, we know, *had
better luck in preserving their culture*.(highlighting mine)
and
While modern-day Hindus have mostly *stopped the worship of these
deities *(highlighting
mine)
preserved or did not preserve?
