Good fun because it has these interesting combinations:

1. These charioteers spoke the same language and recited the same hymns
that would later on be *complied* into the *Rig Veda* by their comrades who
had ventured east. (highlighting mine)

and

The group that went east and later on *composed* the *Rig Veda *(highlighting
mine)

Compiled or composed?

2. The group that went east and later on composed the *Rig Veda*, we know, *had
better luck in preserving their culture*.(highlighting mine)

and

While modern-day Hindus have mostly *stopped the worship of these
deities *(highlighting
mine)

preserved or did not preserve?
