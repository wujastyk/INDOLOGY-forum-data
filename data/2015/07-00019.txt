[INDOLOGY] Religious Literature with Political Purposes
secondary literature on the use and
incorporation of tribal/local myths into Puranic (and/or Tantric) mythology
without the outlook of
as "Hindu-Brahmanic" 's tool for the absorption of
local/tribal traditions with a specific political purpose.
Can be in big number.
But the title of the post brings emphasis to
as "Hindu-Brahmanic" 's tool for the absorption of
local/tribal traditions with a specific political purpose.
Attributing motives particularly political to cultural developments
such as entry/diffusion of tribal/local myths into Puranic (and/or
Tantric) mythology is typical of Marxist historiography.
Right from D D Kosambi through D P Chatopadhyaya, many belonging to
this school published a lot on these lines.
