Subject: [INDOLOGY] Religious Literature with Political Purposes
Message-ID: <CAJGj9eaqZ1E3=OY4J-VDm1DbWUo+PQY-Ac4sn9vtfrxBFpSLuw@mail.gmail.com>

secondary literature on the use and
incorporation of tribal/local myths into Puranic (and/or Tantric) mythology

without the outlook of

as "Hindu-Brahmanic" 's tool for the absorption of
local/tribal traditions with a specific political purpose.

Can be in big number.

But the title of the post brings emphasis to

as "Hindu-Brahmanic" 's tool for the absorption of
local/tribal traditions with a specific political purpose.

Attributing motives particularly political to cultural developments
such as entry/diffusion of tribal/local myths into Puranic (and/or
Tantric) mythology is typical of Marxist historiography.

Right from D D Kosambi through D P Chatopadhyaya, many belonging to
this school published a lot on these lines.
