Dear list-members,

The use of the singular of -k?rik? in text-names is actually not uncommon in ?aiva works. In the published and unpublished works of Aghora?iva (fl. 1157 A.D.), for example, we often find quotations introduced with formulae such as

yad ukta? ni?v?sa-k?rik??, tathokta? n?da-k?rik?y??, tad ukta? bhoga-k?rik?y??, and so forth.

Sometimes only a single verse is quoted, and so one might toy with the hypothesis that the singular was used precisely because a single k?rik? was being introduced.
But sometimes the quotations that are introduced consist of more than one verse. Of course even here one could try to argue that a k?rik? might be considered to be made up of several p?das. But there are other uses of the singular where the context makes clear that it really is the text ? and not a k?rik?-length unit of the text ? that is meant.

To give just one example, this time from tenth-century Kashmir, here is the g?ti verse that concludes Bha??a R?maka??ha's commentary on Sadyojyoti?'s Mok?ak?rik?:

iti mok?ak?rik?y?? n?r?ya?aka??has?nun? racit? |
sa?k?ep?d v?ttir iya? ?i?yahit? bha??ar?maka??hena ||
