Dear list members,


Can any of the list members give me the textual source  for where the
bh?s?ktam comes from?


I've seen an internet  reference to mah?n?r?ya?opani?ad (28) but I haven't
been able to find the bh?s?ktam in the mah?n?r?ya?opani?ad.


The first few verses are from the Taittiriya Samhita 1.5.3 but I'm looking
from where the bh?s?ktam as a whole occurs because  I'm looking for the
scriptural source of the Gayatri mantra:

dhanurdhar?yai vidmahe

sarvasiddhyai ca dh?mahi

tanno dhara? pracoday?t



which is part of the  bh?s?ktam .


I've searched the on-line resources (Bloomfields Concordance, GRETIL and
Muktabodha) and haven't found it.


Thanks,

Harry Spier
