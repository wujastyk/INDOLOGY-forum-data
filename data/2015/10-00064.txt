=?utf-8?Q?[INDOLOGY]_Textual_source_of_bh=C5=ABs=C5=ABktam?=
Dear list members,
Can any of the list members give me the textual source  for where the
bh?s?ktam comes from?
I've seen an internet  reference to mah?n?r?ya?opani?ad (28) but I haven't
been able to find the bh?s?ktam in the mah?n?r?ya?opani?ad.
The first few verses are from the Taittiriya Samhita 1.5.3 but I'm looking
from where the bh?s?ktam as a whole occurs because  I'm looking for the
scriptural source of the Gayatri mantra:
dhanurdhar?yai vidmahe
sarvasiddhyai ca dh?mahi
tanno dhara? pracoday?t
which is part of the  bh?s?ktam .
I've searched the on-line resources (Bloomfields Concordance, GRETIL and
Muktabodha) and haven't found it.
Thanks,
Harry Spier
