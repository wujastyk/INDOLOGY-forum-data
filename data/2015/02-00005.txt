[INDOLOGY] Docx to Latex conversion
Respected all,
I spent three sleepless nights to identify the free and efficient converter
from Docx to latex format.
After the experiments, I settled on writer2latex.
With some minor manual editing, the tex file worked beautifully.
Just sending the video link in case someone has had the same pitiable
plight as mine.
