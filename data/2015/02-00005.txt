Subject: [INDOLOGY] Docx to Latex conversion
Message-ID: <CADSGPzVjCTLTA8trorr5-FeR5ykkTFn7UJ=URiQA_8usr8u5mw@mail.gmail.com>

Respected all,
I spent three sleepless nights to identify the free and efficient converter
from Docx to latex format.

After the experiments, I settled on writer2latex.
With some minor manual editing, the tex file worked beautifully.

Just sending the video link in case someone has had the same pitiable
plight as mine.
