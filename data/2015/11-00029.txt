[INDOLOGY] Texts with different topics by one author
Thanks a lot for the list of recommendations! 
After a short look at GRETIL, Abhinavagupta and Kshemendra seem to be the best (easiest available) ones to begin with.
@Jonathan: Yes, it?s for authorship attribution ? I need some data to ?calibrate? the statistical measures and test some basic assumptions.
Best, Oliver
