[INDOLOGY] Manuscripts and cryptography in India
Dear Dr. Delire,
     One of the famous cases of cryptography is that of the Mah?nubh?va
sect in the region of Maharashtra.  Beginning in the 13th century, they
used various secret codes to write their Marathi works.  These were decoded
about a hundred years ago by scholars like V.K. Rajwade and others, and now
most of these Mah?nubh?va works are available in Devanagari editions.
