The LC records looks like a totally unimproved PREMARC record, for a Marathi title, not the Srinagar journal.

 Dear colleagues,
?I found a reference in the New Catalogus Catalogorum (Vol. 4, p. 87) to the K?vyakaustubha's having been "Ptd. (1) in the Skt. Journal ?r?, Srinagar, X. 3, 4. p. 39." I know nothing about this journal. I managed to find a sparse entry for it on the Library of Congress's website (http://lccn.loc.gov/71920458; call # AP95.M3 S7), but I can't for the life of me find it on Worldcat. Does anyone know of this journal, and of a library that might happen to hold it?
Thanks,
David
