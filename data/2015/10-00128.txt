Dear Colleagues,

     A student of mine, Ann Johnson, is reading Bh?vaviveka's Tarkajv?l?,
in Tibetan, and found a reference to a list of 360 non-Buddhist schools.
She has listed more than 100 of these names in English translation from
Tibetan.  I would like to know if there is anywhere in Buddhist literature,
a Sanskrit list of these or similar non-Buddhist schools.  Since the
Tarkajv?l? is not available in its Sanskrit original, figuring out the
original Sanskrit names of these schools from their Tibetan translations is
a challenging task.  Any help would be appreciated.
