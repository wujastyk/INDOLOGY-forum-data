[INDOLOGY] Religious Literature with Political Purposes
Dear all,
I would just specify that my aim in the use of a term as "tribalisation"
(and "tribal") is intended to give the same dignity and rank to the so
(wrongly) called "minor", "other", "local" traditios that is storically
awarded to the Sanskrit-Brahmanic tradition.
*Regarding the "sanskritisation":*
although I don't agree with Srinivas (because of what we have already wrote
about dialectic between traditions more than sanskritisation), the use of
the term it is a (in my personal idea of research) form of respect for the
scholar that proposed this concept in the middle of 50s, around 60 years
ago! It was for sure not perfect at all, but was a great study that let we
speculate about Hindu/non-Hindu cross-cultural interactions, hybridisation
of an Indic culture, religious syncretism between Hindu/non-Hindu cultures,
etc... It is just my modest academic position as young researcher.
With the best regards,
Paolo
