[INDOLOGY] Ananya Vajpeyi on Hindutva, caste,	and Brahminical values
one paragraph of this USCIRF report looks interesting
"Violations against Sikhs India?s Sikh community has long pursued a change
to Article 25 of India?s constitution which states, ?Hindus shall be
construed as including a reference to persons Reportedly, local police
seldom provide protection, refuse to accept complaints, rarely investigate,
and in a few cases encourage Christians to move or hide their religion.
USCIRF | ANNUAL REPORT 2015 151 INDIA professing the Sikh, Jain or Buddhist
religion, and the reference to Hindu religious institutions shall be
construed accordingly.? The lack of recognition of Sikhism as a distinct
religion *denies Sihks access to social services or employment and
educational preferences that are available to other religious minority
*communities
and to scheduled caste Hindus. (This is also true for the other faiths
listed in Article 25.) Sikhs are often harassed and pressured to reject
religious practices and beliefs that are distinct to Sikhism, such as
dress, unshorn hair, and the carrying of religious items, including the
kirpan." (pp.150-151)
 NCM profile is clear on who is minority

Ananya Says
"*Adhikaara *is once again usurped exclusively for *Hindus, men and upper
castes*......
Right-wing Hindu NRIs speak of the *adhikaara **to study Indic knowledge
systems* and Indian history, which according to them belong only to
Indians, Hindus and those representing ?The Tradition? (howsoever dubious
their definition or mistaken their grasp of ?tradition?). Foreigners,
Muslims, Christians and critical or dissenting voices, even among Hindus,
and especially from women scholars, are summarily dismissed through
gestures of *bahishkaara*,"
Ananya Vajapeyee seems to be not aware of the facts that more and more
people from so called bahiskrta class are in samskrit studies here.

Years after years  all kinds of people from Europe Us and other parts fly
to India to study samskrit, yoga etc. who is discriminating?
Even Wendy Doniger studied in india for one year.
is criticising a Bahiskaara?
I hope "it" prevails.
