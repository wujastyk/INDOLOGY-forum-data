[INDOLOGY] navarasam
Friends:
The name of the book is The number of Rasas by Raghavan published by Adyar Library.

Re: [INDOLOGY] navarasam
Long ago late Prof. V. Raghavan wrote a book on the ninth rasa. The name escapes me.

Dear List,
Is someone able to help me locate the first mention of the term 'navarasam' and the argument that developed surrounding this concept as it was debated between the 6th to 10th centuries? 
Any help in clarifying this is greatly appreciated. 
All the best,
