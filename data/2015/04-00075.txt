=?utf-8?Q?[INDOLOGY]_Articles_on_history_and_use_of_=C5=9Br=C4=AB_as_title_of_respect?=
Can any list members give me the bibliographic information of any
indological articles on the history and use of "?r?" as a honorific or
title of respect. Or better yet send me a pdf of any such articles.
Many thanks,
Harry Spier
