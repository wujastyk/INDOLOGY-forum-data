[INDOLOGY] Fwd: Read the Sanskrit texts: Why both Rajiv	Malhotra and his critics are wrong about plagiarism
Colleagues,
I admire Dominik for his immediate public correction of an earlier remark of his. However, if I had known that he was going to forward my communication to the List, I would have made its wording a little bit more grammatical and not allowed it to retain its ?note-to-a-friend? form. Please delete ?about? from ?not about a marker? and change ?his sentence? to ?his/her sentence?. It would also have been better if I had alerted Dominik with some such heading as ?Not for forwarding to the List, at least not yet.?. Sorry for the extra reading you all had to do.
a.a.
