Not sure if it would help ? There is a text in Tamil named ?y?pparu?kalakk?rikai,? which defines the rules for composing Tamil poetry.
 This text is attributed to amitac?karar, a Jain, of the ~11th century. 
Each verse in this text is addressed to a woman (?k?rikai?). 
If anyone would be interested to know further about this text, let me know.
Regards,
Rajam
