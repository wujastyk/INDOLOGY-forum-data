A penetrating study of both Buddhist and brahminical theories is Claus
Oetke, "'Ich' und das Ich. Analytische Untersuchungen zur
buddhistisch-brahmanischen ?tmankontroverse". Stuttgart 1988: Franz
Steiner Verlag Wiesbaden GmbH.

(Works treated include P?li suttas, Milindapa?ha, Abhidharmako?abh??ya,
proofs of ?tman in Ny?yas?tra, -bh??ya and -v?rttika, in Vai?e?ikas?tras
and Pad?rthadharmasa?graha, in Kum?rila's ?lokav?rttika, plus a
philosophical evaluation of proofs, arguments and refutations.)

For Dharmak?rti in particular, see more recently Vincent Eltschinger and
Isabelle Rati?, "Self, no-self, and salvation: Dharmak?rti's critique of
the notions of self and person." Wien 2013: Verlag der ?sterreichischen
Akademie der Wissenschaften.

With best wishes,
