[INDOLOGY] RESOURCE> Journals with Buddhist Studies material	(Indica et Buddhica)
[Apologies for cross posting.]
Dear colleagues,
I'm mentioning the availability of a file listing 650 or so journals
containing Buddhist Studies material. The current version can always
be downloaded from here:
 Journals with Buddhist Studies material (Indica et Buddhica)
 http://indica-et-buddhica.org/indica-et-buddhica-tabulae-current.pdf
Each of the titles within the file link directly to bibliographic
details on the Indica et Buddhica site, e.g.:
 Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies
 http://indica-et-buddhica.org/tabulae/b/bulletin-of-the-school-of-oriental-and-african-studies-university-of-london
The title list and supporting material falls out of work on Scholia
and Scholiast:
 Indica et Buddhica -- Scholia :: Scholiast
 http://indica-et-buddhica.org/scholia-scholiast
Comments, corrections and additions are most welcome.
Kind regards,
 Richard
