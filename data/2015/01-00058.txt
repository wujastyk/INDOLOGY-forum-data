[INDOLOGY] Satirical criticism in Sanskrit literature and	philosophy?
Dear Prof. Houber, dear members of the list,
regarding Hindi, there is of course one book that cannot be avoided: 
/R?g-darb?r?/ (1968) by Shrilal Shukla. It narrates in a very hilarious 
and iconoclastic way the life of villagers (but also of a young na?ve 
scholar) and proposes a first-hand critique of postcolonial Indian 
society (Shukla knew from the inside this world and the panchayati 
system, as he worked for many years for the IAS).
The novel has been translated (or sometimes rather adapted) into English 
by Gillian Wright.
A good paper on it is:
Anjaria, Ulka, ? Satire, Literary Realism and the Indian State : /Six 
Acres and a Third/ and /Raag Darbari/ ?, /Economic and Political 
Weekly/, 41 (46), 2006 : 4795-4800 (http://www.jstor.org/stable/4418923).
Best wishes,
Nicola
