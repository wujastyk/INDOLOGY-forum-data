Nagaraj: I believe the derivation of Telugu *cukka *< Skt. *?ukra *is a
folk etymology, although, it is very popular among the Sanskrit pundits of
the Telugu land. The word *cukka *in the meaning of "a small drop", "dot"
and  "star" is found across several Dravidian languages  that it is
difficult to assume that *?ukra *became *cukka *and then spread into so
many of these languages (See [DEDR 2646
<http://kolichala.com/DEDR/searchindexid.php?q=2646&esb=1> ]*)*.

Furthermore, beside *v?lucukka (**?????????) *for *?ukra*, Telugu has names
for other stars containing *cukka*, such as *v?gucukka *(????????? North
Star),  *ecakanka?icukka  *(???????????? uttar??a?a), *kukkacukka *
(??????????=*punarvasu*), kummaras?recukka (??????????????? vi??kh?), it
becomes clear the the word *cukka *was generic term for star, and not
derived from  Sanskrit *?ukra*.
