Subject: [INDOLOGY] Religious Literature with Political Purposes
Message-ID: <CAMOCTf9q5O4N8w3YfCPiN-G6f+f46drPkJw4=mz2XQTZu4pvMQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Indologist-friends,

Maybe someone can advice me about secondary literature on the use and
incorporation of tribal/local myths into Puranic (and/or Tantric) mythology
as "Hindu-Brahmanic" 's tool for the absorption of
local/tribal traditions with a specific political purpose.

Best,
Paolo
