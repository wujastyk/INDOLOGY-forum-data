[INDOLOGY] Religious Literature with Political Purposes
Dear Indologist-friends,
Maybe someone can advice me about secondary literature on the use and
incorporation of tribal/local myths into Puranic (and/or Tantric) mythology
as "Hindu-Brahmanic" 's tool for the absorption of
local/tribal traditions with a specific political purpose.
Best,
Paolo
