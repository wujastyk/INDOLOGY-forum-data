[INDOLOGY] Malhotra's motives
Agreed, Dominik.
It is surprising to see all these posts on INDOLOGY trying to justify 
Malhotra.
Malhotra proudly says in his 'challenge' to Andrew Nicholson that:
"For the first 10 years of my work in this area, I gave away a 
substantial portion of my life savings in an unsuccessful attempt to 
fund and change the Indologists? hearts."
So he got tired of giving money to "Western" indologists (whatever a 
Western indologist is) and institutions because those Indologists would 
not change their hearts. In other words, he was not interested in 
sponsoring open research, only research that conformed to his ideology. 
Then, he explains, he turned against /them/, and "became their harshest 
critic."
And he profers a threat:
"I have on file a lot of grant correspondence with Harvard, Princeton, 
Columbia, to name just a few. Naturally, they worry that I am exposing 
their secrets. One day I will get someone to organize all that material 
into a publication."
So he is now threatening to punish these /rogue/ Indologists for not 
having converted to his ideology.
