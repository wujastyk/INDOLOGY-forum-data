[INDOLOGY] Seeking IHQ article from 1949
Many thanks to the list, which has yet again gone beyond mere provision and provided illumination ? thanks in particular to Andrew Ollett (who pointed out that IHQ is on DLI), Shayne Clarke (who also pointed me towards the new facsimile edition of the Gilgit mss.), and Jonathan Silk. 
Be well all,
?WBTD.
