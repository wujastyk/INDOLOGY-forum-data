Many thanks to the list, which has yet again gone beyond mere provision and provided illumination ? thanks in particular to Andrew Ollett (who pointed out that IHQ is on DLI), Shayne Clarke (who also pointed me towards the new facsimile edition of the Gilgit mss.), and Jonathan Silk. 

Be well all,

?WBTD.

The Sanskrit text itself is available from the DSBC and thus also Gretil, but I'd like to read what he had to say about the manuscript sources. This was originally published in IHQ 25 (1949), pp. 19-30, and then reprinted in Two Buddhist Vinaya Texts in Sanskrit, Calcutta 1977.
