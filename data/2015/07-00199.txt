Dear All,
I will be very much thankful if you could kindly help me locate the following verse in Kalha?a's R?jatara?gin?, which describes the ten classes of Brahmins. Many secondary works cite it as appearing in the R?jatara?gin? but does not give the exact reference.
?kar???ak?? ca taila?g? dr?vi?? mah?r???rak?? gurjar?? ceti pancaiva dr?vi?? vindhyadak?i?e | s?rasvat?? k?nyakubj? gau?? utkalamaithil?? pa?cagau?? iti khy?t? vindhyasyottarav?sina?.?
[The five Dr?vi?a classes (Pa?ca Dr?vi?as) living to the south of the Vindhy? (mountain range) are Kar???akas (in Karnataka), Taila?gas (in Andhra), Dr?vi?as (in Tamilnadu and Kerala), those in Mah?r???ra and those in Gurjaras (in Gujarat). S?rasvatas (in Punjab, Kashmir & Sindh), K?nyakubjas (in Uttar Pradesh), Gau?as (in Kurukshetra and Rajasthan), Utkalas (in Orissa), and Maithil?s (in Bihar) living to the north of the Vindhya are known as the five Gau?a classes (Pa?ca Gau?as.)].
Thank you very much in advance.
Best Wishes,
