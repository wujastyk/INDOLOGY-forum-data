[INDOLOGY] recent publications: conference reports over 2011-12, 2012-13, 2013-14
Dear David,
Thanks for your feedback. In fact, if you go to http://ashp.revues.org/1748
you should have direct access to the conference reports.
In the course of time I will place a copy on my Academia.edu page.
For Indra I am also preparing an expanded English version of my argument.
In the conference report, the relevant portions are paragraphs 28-32, where
you find quotations of / references to some of the relevant verses and
passages (RV, RVkhila, Asvalayana-samhita, Aitareya-Aranayaka, Panini,
Kasika). Although the "modern" Ved?nta-style adhy?tman interpretation of
the Vedas is grafted on the ancient one recognized in the old Brahmanas,
Aranyakas and the Nirukta (next to and often co-occurring with adhidaiva,
adhiyaj?a and aitih?sika interpretations), the two are to be sharply
distinguished. As for the adhy?tman interpretation I found for Indra and
which is reflected in the word indriya (including its curious use in the
term indriya-sth?na in Ayurveda), there is nothing particularly Ved?ntic
about it: it could equally fit a Vaisesika or S?mkhya view on the soul or
self.
Best regards,
Jan
