[INDOLOGY] Bibliography of TeX critical editions done with EDMAC, LEDMAC, eLEDMAC, reLEDMAC
Dear colleagues,
There is a Zotero group where one may record a bibliographical entry for
any critical edition that uses the TeX or LaTeX packages for formatting
critical editions.  If your critical edition uses EDMAC or one of its
derivatives, please consider adding an entry for your book or article to
the list.  The address is:
