[INDOLOGY] Unidentified character (with attachment)
Dear Allessandro,
Thank you very much for the example. ??????, derived from ???? as 
suggested by Kenneth Zysk, would certainly fit the bill alright. I will 
go back and see how it fits with the other instances of the character I 
have met with.
Best wishes,
Jacob
