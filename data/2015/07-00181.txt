[INDOLOGY] Query: Date of the Bhagavatam
Friedhelm Hardy?s very significant observations in Viraha-Bhakti on the indebtedness of the Bh?gavatapur??a to the Tamil poetry of the ??v?rs should surely be mentioned here !
As I have pointed out in annotation to a translation of Bh?gavata X, chapter 31, the second-syllable rhyming used in passages of heightened emotion is further evidence of this Tamilian influence. The style of the work, as many have observed, really stands out from amongst other run-of-the-mill Pur??as.
And one should also consider Charlotte Schmid?s observations based on South Indian narrative sculpture about K???a : ?Aventures divines de K???a : la l?l? et les traditions narratives des temples c??a? in Arts Asiatiques 2002.
In view of all this, such early dates as C7th and C8th seem implausible and such late ones as 1200 seem very unlikely.
