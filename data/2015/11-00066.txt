Greetings to all, namaskaromi --
Perhaps you know of secondary literature concerning the use of so-called
paribh???s, or interpretive rules by any name, in dharma??stra
particularly. Of course P. V. Kane has laid the ground in Chapter XXX of
History of Dharma??stra, volume 5.
I am also interested in explicit mentions of the word 'paribh???' in works
of dharma??stra. I've already unearthed a few by searching the texts on
GRETIL.
I would be honored and delighted to receive your advice and suggestions.
All the best,
Jo
