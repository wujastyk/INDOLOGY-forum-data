Dear Colleagues,

I am forwarding a message posted on RISA-L by Professor Lutgendorf of the University of Iowa concerning a painting that is expected to be part of an upcoming exhibit on the R?m?ya?a at the Asian Art Museum of San Francisco, an exhibit with which I too am involved.  We would be most grateful to any one who can shed light on the scene depicted in the painting. 

Best.

> The painting below is presently owned by the Brooklyn Museum and attributed to the court of Mandi during the period of Raja Sidh Sen or Raja Shamser Sen. It shows a blue-clad warrior prince (who might be Rama, without bush skin, or Lakshmana) firing an arrow upward while (apparently) gazing at the reflection of his target in a shallow bowl of water ? perhaps a sort of skill-test, like that undertaken by Arjuna at Draupadi?s svayamvara. The figures to the right appear to be Vibhishana and Hanuman, with a female face looking out from behind the former; the figure to the left is clearly Ravana, complete with a donkey?s head as his tenth head (as is often found in paintings), who is bleeding from the stumps of three of his hands?as if the battle between him and Rama/Lakshmana had been interrupted by the reverse-shot episode.
