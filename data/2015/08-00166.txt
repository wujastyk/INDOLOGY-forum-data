[INDOLOGY] Fwd: Help on mystery painting of Ramayana (?) episode
Dear Colleagues,
I am forwarding a message posted on RISA-L by Professor Lutgendorf of the University of Iowa concerning a painting that is expected to be part of an upcoming exhibit on the R?m?ya?a at the Asian Art Museum of San Francisco, an exhibit with which I too am involved.  We would be most grateful to any one who can shed light on the scene depicted in the painting. 
Best.
