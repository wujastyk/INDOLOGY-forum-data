Subject: [INDOLOGY] Unidentified character
Message-ID: <da20e15befe348f658bd0553fed385ec@fabularasa.dk>

Dear list,

Can anyone help me identifying the character that appears twice in the 
third word in the attached image, i.e. below ???? ???????

The image represents a square of a (poorly scanned) gyan chaupar 
painting from early 19th century Bikaner, Rajasthan. I would expect the 
reading ?????? here, but it could easily be something else. I have met 
with this character several times, but never in a context where I could 
be absolutely certain of its interpretation.

Any help much appreciated.

Best,
Jacob
