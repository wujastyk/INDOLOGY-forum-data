[INDOLOGY] Unidentified character
Dear list,
Can anyone help me identifying the character that appears twice in the 
third word in the attached image, i.e. below ???? ???????
The image represents a square of a (poorly scanned) gyan chaupar 
painting from early 19th century Bikaner, Rajasthan. I would expect the 
reading ?????? here, but it could easily be something else. I have met 
with this character several times, but never in a context where I could 
be absolutely certain of its interpretation.
Any help much appreciated.
Best,
Jacob
