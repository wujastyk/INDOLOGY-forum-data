Dear List,
I would be interested in a .pdf copy of Louis de la Vall?e Poussin Memorial Volume, ed. Narendra Nath Law, Calcutta (Oriental Press), 1940:
https://books.google.be/books?id=XN4NAAAAYAAJ
https://books.google.be/books?id=ii35GwAACAAJ
where there is e.g. the following article :
- L. Renou "Identity of the two Pata?jalis" pp. 368-373 
and several other interesting articles
all these articles were also included, in a different place, within the Indian Historical Quarterly vol. 16  of 1940
(but not in the fasc. 1 and 4 available through
http://www.southasiaarchive.com/Content/sarf.120027 not free of charge)
(from here Hathi Trust offers a limited search only for the IHQ)
http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000050121 
Only the DLI exemplar seems therefore available :

e.g. L. Renou "Identity of the two Pata?jalis" is in the IHQ volume at the pp. 586-591
