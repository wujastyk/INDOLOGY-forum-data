Subject: [INDOLOGY] Accessing the NGMCP title list
Message-ID: <CAPW7aQGZNbtnYLeEvm+jPmFvuR0GQiPnpdK7YsQc_sGi+UHHtQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list members,

I tried to access the NGMCP catalogue title list through this link from
their website:
http://catalogue.ngmcp.uni-hamburg.de/

but it gives me "page unavailable".  Is there another link to the title
list that works.

Thanks,
Harry Spier
