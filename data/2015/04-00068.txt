Among Gaudiya Vaishnavas, the terms siddha and jivan-mukta can be used synonymously in some important contexts.
siddha may mean ?perfected? or ?one who has attained the highest object? etc. Clearly among those who value liberation as a perfection or highest object, the terms may be used synonymously.
Bhagavad-gita is full of verses that speak of being liberated from karma etc in this life, i.e. jivan-mukta  
The great Rupa Gosvami, in Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu 1.21.87 speaks of jivan-mukta. It is a standard term.
It depends on how one conceives of mukti, but mukti, however conceived is often considered a siddhi, or perfection of life, apart from other uses of all these terms.
