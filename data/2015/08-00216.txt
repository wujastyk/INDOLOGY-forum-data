[INDOLOGY] training in poetic composition in traditional	Sanskrit education?
Dear Allen,
     In Pune, we were positively encouraged to compose verses in Sanskrit.
My highschool Sanskrit teacher, Pandit N. N. Bhide, routinely asked us to
translate from Marathi into Sanskrit verse.  The Tilak Maharashtra
Vidyapith used to hold various annual competitions on the occasion of
Vy?sap?j? including story-telling, verse-composition, quick memorization,
Sanskrit debate etc.  So, composing verses in Sanskrit was encouraged in
Pune, not only in the more traditional institutions, but also in modern
institutions like the S. P. College and Fergusson College.  Several of our
teachers used to compose poems in Sanskrit and publish them in the local
Sanskrit journals like ??rad? and Bh?ratav???, and also in the annual
magazines of Fergusson College etc.  I am describing my historical
experience, but some of these activities are continuing into modern times
as well.
