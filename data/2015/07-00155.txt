Dear List,
Let me clarify my contributions to this discussion.  I am not very much
troubled by Malhotra's plagiarism.  I haven't read any of his books [why
would I? there's nothing there for me!].  No, what troubles me about
Malhotra is that he is  a man with a lot of money who has managed to buy
his way into Indology, and he has bought not only a bunch of nativist
Hindutvavadis!  He has bought a lot of mainstream Sanskritists as well.
See Stella Sandahl's query about his Infinity foundation's funding of a
chair at Harvard.  He has been buying up Sanskritists just as Donald Trump
has been buying up American panditas here in the USA.
So, as Greg Bailey and others have suggested, let us look at his vile
ideology. So, really, does he really say in his plagiarized books that the
only people who can understand and translate Hindu texts are Hindus?  Well,
let us talk about that too.
Best wishes
George Thompson
