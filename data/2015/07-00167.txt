Dear colleagues,
I have Zgusta not at hand to check, but it is important to note that the accusations of plagiarism of MW were made against his first edition (1872). The second edition (1899), used by us, was very carefully revised and in this work he had some good assistants. See, beside his introduction, the reviews by Bloomfield /AJPh 21, 1900, 323-32) and Winternitz (WZKM 14, 1900, 353-360).
Some 30 years ago, when checking the various interpretation given to some Vedic ritual terms, I noted that Apte has copied some lemmas directly from the old Calcutta dictionary edited by Wilson.
Best,
Klaus
