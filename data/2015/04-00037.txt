Dear Herman,
you might be interested to hear that, a little more than 48hours ago,
(on Easter early morning :-),
I have finally decided that it was worth the effort
to turn the CTamil list into a MODERATED list,
because it migh possibly resurrect it
from its occasional sorry state
For many years,

(because doing the MODERATION job is not attractive),
but finally
ALEA JACTA EST
Best wishes
