[INDOLOGY] training in poetic composition in traditional Sanskrit education?
Dear Allen,
I seem to remember that there is some material about composing or 
imitating verses as training exercises for would-be poets in 
Rajasekhara's Kavyamimamsa (and/or in related works). Sorry for the 
vague reference!
