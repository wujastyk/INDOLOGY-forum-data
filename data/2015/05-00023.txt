Have there been any systematic scholarly studies of the Buddhist positions on anatman that someone could recommend?
Bhattacharya:
"Itis sometimes said that although the texts that have been used prove that theBuddha did not deny the Upani?adic ?tman, or even that he accepted it, thereare others, thousands of others, which prove just the opposite. Well, since thenames of those texts have not been revealed so far, I will stick to my positionuntil it is proved wrong."
