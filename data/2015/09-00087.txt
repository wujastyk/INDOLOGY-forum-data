*Comments on the book*

*?Down through the ages a large number of hymns and stotra-s have been
composed in honour of Hanuman?also known as Mahavir. Of these the most
popular is Goswami Tulasi Das?s famous forty-verse hymn to Hanuman called
the Hanuman Chalisa. This is recited by millions of Hindus everyday around
the world. However, analytical work on this text is not easily available.
In the present book Shri Nityanand Misra has translated and annotated the
text based on the acclaimed Hindi commentary Mahaviri (1983) by Swami
Ramabhadracharya. This throws a great deal of light on the deeper meaning
of Tulasi Das?s famous work, and will be welcomed by scholars and laymen
alike. I commend Shri Nityanand Misra for the devotion and dedication with
which he has undertaken this work.?*

*?Inspired in equal measure by profound devotion and immense knowledge, the
Mahaviri commentary on the beloved and revered Hanuman-Calisa will be
welcomed by the many devoted reciters of this praise-poem who would like to
explore its deeper meanings. Buttressing his insights with numerous
citations of authoritative Sanskrit texts and the principal writings of
Tulasidasa, Svami Ramabhadracarya both situates the calisa in the ancient
Hindu literary tradition, and also shows it to contain a veritable
distillation or essence of the Ramayana Katha. Nityananda Misra?s careful
English translation, scholarly yet readable, will make these insights
accessible to a broader audience.?*

in lifestyle. Gives a new dimension to the world of devotion. A must-read.?*

Hanuman-Chalisa Demystified? comprising the text, its wonderful commentary,
gloss, annotations, notes, etc. will certainly exhilarate hundred thousands
of devotees and other readers also. The editor-translator Sri Nityanand
Misra and the publisher Niramaya publishing house both deserve profuse
felicitations on this new arrival. I send my cordial good wishes on this
