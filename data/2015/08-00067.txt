[INDOLOGY] Second-syllable rhyming in Dravidian
Dear Professor Paturi,
briefly
(1) the "is not true" predicate applied to the portion of your message 
which I quoted in my message.
(2) thanks for confirming that you cannot provide "massive evidence" 
from Tamil literature
(3) I am certainly VERY interested in learning more about Telugu meters 
and obtaining authentic information from you on that topic. If the forum 
has had enough concerning metrics (which some people consider as a dry 
subject ;-), we can also have private exchanges about the topic ...
(4) I also had the earlier statement by S. Palaniappan in mind when I 
was referring to the lenses provided by Y?pparu?kalam and Y?pparu?kalak 
k?rikai and you might remember that I immediately commented on his 
message and tried to suggest that Indira Peterson may have referred to 
the more frequent usage
I believe I should not post more today :-)
Yours with every good wish
