[INDOLOGY] Sorry, another request
Dear Colleagues,
It seems that our otherwise excellent libraries do not have a copy of 
the following book:
Bhairav?nandan??akam.
Main Author: 	Ma?ika, 14th cent.
Other Authors: 	Dwivedi, Shriman Narain, 1935-
Language(s): 	Sanskrit
Published: 	[n.p.] 1971?]
Note: 	Romanized.
Physical Description: 	11, 49 p. 23 cm.
I know the book has been digitized in the Hathi Trust Digital Library 
and I was wondering if any of you has a digital copy of it.
Best wishes,
Camillo A. Formigatti
