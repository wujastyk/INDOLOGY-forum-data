Subject: [INDOLOGY] transliteration of proper nouns
Message-ID: <CAFdBLNiEciccDMsK8pgnfRtgqTMR5Uq5L1a1Hq7G4EGAZmD9Gw@mail.gmail.com>

I am engaged in a project that will draw on a few proper nouns from
nineteenth century India, many of which are Bengali. Is there a
transliteration standard used in modern published works for older Indic
proper nouns, particularly those that exist in print in "unusual" forms?
In other words, does one follow the "old" Bengali spellings, or revise them
to follow Sanskritized versions?

Thus, e.g., Keshub Chandra Sen, or, Keshub Chunder Sen?


Also, are diacriticals used for proper nouns? Vivekananda, or, Vivek?nanda?


And, again, are diacriticals used for organizations? Arya Samaj or ?rya
Sam?j


For all other Sanskrit elements, the project does use diacriticals
(e.g., Pur??a)


Any guidance is appreciated!

Herman
