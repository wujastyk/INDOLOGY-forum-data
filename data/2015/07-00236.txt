Malhotra?s assertion that "there are no quotation marks in Sanskrit"
It has been more than a week since I pointed out on the Indology forum
itself that Malhotra had in mind a written symbol indicating quotation, not
about a marker in speech or reproduction of speech such as iti. Note his
words ?in its character set?.
Et tu, Dominik?
You should publicly correct yourself. It is not proper to quote someone by
dropping an important part of his sentence and suggest that he/she is
terribly ignorant just because one disagrees with him/her, unless one
wishes to join the rank of Steve Farmer et al.
