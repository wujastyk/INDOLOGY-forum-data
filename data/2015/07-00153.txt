Subject: [INDOLOGY] Honor code (Was Re: Raji Malhotra, plagiarism,	and the Saraswati)

Thank you, Dan

The Harvard Honor Code <http://honor.fas.harvard.edu/honor-code> addresses more than mere plagiarism when it comes to academic integrity. I would like to know what type of instances Indologists would consider as or have come across as not "appropriate collection and use of data? or ?falsifying data? mentioned by the Honor Code.

Thanks in advance

Regards,
Palaniappan

So it was decided a clearer, more concise statement that is brought to all undergraduates attention was needed. See

There are separate sections aimed at faculty and at students. The student page "avoiding plagiarism <http://guides.library.ualberta.ca/content.php?pid=560222&sid=4618015>" contains useful guidelines that might have helped Malhotra when he was writing. There is a video guide about what is and what is not acceptable copying <https://youtu.be/8Bx5DAqTPhU>.  Humour is a personal thing, but I found it very funny.
