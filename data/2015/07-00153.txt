[INDOLOGY] Honor code (Was Re: Raji Malhotra, plagiarism,	and the Saraswati)
Thank you, Dan
The Harvard Honor Code <http://honor.fas.harvard.edu/honor-code> addresses more than mere plagiarism when it comes to academic integrity. I would like to know what type of instances Indologists would consider as or have come across as not "appropriate collection and use of data? or ?falsifying data? mentioned by the Honor Code.
Thanks in advance
