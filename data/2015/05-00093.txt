[INDOLOGY] Sources for verses on fate/karma
The opening of Vyoma?iva?s commentary appears in clearer form in my article,  Pad?rthasa?graha??k? of Vyoma?iva: A Partial Reconstruction of Folia 2-3a, pages 401-413 of Karin Preisendanc, editor, Expanding and Merging Horizons (Vienna, 2007).
We may doubt that dev?bh?gavatam is the source of the verse n?bhukta? k??yate karma kalpako?i?atairapi |ava?yameva bhoktavya? k?ta? karma ?ubh??ubham ||
Here is dev?bh?gavatam 9.40.72cd-74cd:
ukta? hi svak?ta? karma bhujyatekhilabh?rate || 72 ||
?ubh??ubha? ca yatki?citsvakarmaphalabhukpum?n | n?bhukta? k??yate karma kalpako?i?atairapi || 73 ||
ava?yameva bhoktavya? k?ta? karma ?ubh??ubham | ityevamukta? vede ca k???ena param?tman? || 74 ||
dev?bh?gavatam 9.29.69cd reads only this half verse: n?bhukta? k??yate karma kalpako?i?atairapi || 69||. The reference to verse 70 appears to be an error.
Note: I have used a scan of the edition by r?matejap???ya available for download at vedpuran.net <http://vedpuran.net/>. The scan gives only the text without the title page, etc.
I need some help in understanding Walter?s mah?bh?rata reference.
I will upload a pdf of the CSS edition of vyoma?iva?s commentary  to archive.org <http://archive.org/> in the near future. I downloaded this from DLI.
