[INDOLOGY] Mss. from Rotkuppelraum, Qyzyl
Dear Prof. Salomon,
I'd also recommend
Malzahn, Melanie (ed.). 2007. *Instrumenta Tocharica*. Heidelberg: Winter.
It has a chapter on the expeditions by Hannes Fellner and five chapters on
collections and concordances.
The Comprehensive Edition of Tocharian Manuscripts (CEToM) is also
extremely useful: https://www.univie.ac.at/tocharian/.
If this doesn't do the trick, let me know, and I'll put you in touch with a
real Tocharian specialist.
Best wishes,
Dieter Gunkel
