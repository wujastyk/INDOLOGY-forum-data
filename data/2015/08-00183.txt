[INDOLOGY] twenty-four buddhas/jinas - artistic evidence?
There are 24 upavy?has of Vi??u in the P??car?tra tradition, 
distinguished by the order in which their four hands display the discus, 
conch, club and lotus flower. (I regret that I have no textual source 
for this -- perhaps someone else does?)
