[INDOLOGY] Rgveda Padapaatha DVD from Kerala
Dear Michael,
Good to know that this important knowledge has been recorded on a DVD. The
description speaks of "referring to four versions of Pada Paatha texts
available at the time of its preparation." If "version" means ??kh?, I know
of only three extant versions of the padap??ha, two of which have become
available in printed editions only recently. Is there a fourth? Or is he
perhaps referring to four different printed editions of the ??kala padap??ha?
Thanks.
Best regards,
