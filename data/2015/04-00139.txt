Dear colleagues,
 I found a reference in the New Catalogus Catalogorum (Vol. 4, p. 87) to
the K?vyakaustubha's having been "Ptd. (1) in the Skt. Journal *?r?, *Srinagar,
X. 3, 4. p. 39." I know nothing about this journal. I managed to find a
sparse entry for it on the Library of Congress's website (
http://lccn.loc.gov/71920458; call # AP95.M3 S7), but I can't for the life
of me find it on Worldcat. Does anyone know of this journal, and of a
library that might happen to hold it?
Thanks,
David
