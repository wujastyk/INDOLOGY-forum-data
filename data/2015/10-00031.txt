city-dwellers. From the religious perspective, in the last twenty years or
so, an increase in modern so-called "mega-temples" has become part of urban
religiosity; as well as the emergence of charismatic movements featuring
"mega-gurus" that attract millions of devotees in India and beyond. However
the development of cities has also seen an increase of street shrines. Be
they Hindu, Muslim, Christian, Buddhist, Jain or shared between different
faiths, these different roadside shrines have an ubiquitous presence in the
cities of India, to the point that some of them surpass main temples,
churches and mosques in popularity and patronage. However they differ from
the latter main temples by the apparently informal nature of the practices
and discourses that take place. The panel will investigate to what extent
these shrines are important sites for the individual sense of belonging to
particular localities and/or to particular communities. Drawing on
ethnographic research conducted in one specific site or on different
connected sites, each paper will contribute to describe and question the
discourses and practices at stake in what appears to be an important part
of the everyday religion in Indian cities.
Please feel free to forward this call to other interested colleagues!
Looking forward very much to your contributions and to a fruitful and
interesting panel session,
