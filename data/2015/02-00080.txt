[INDOLOGY] Examples of very ambiguous devanagari Sanskrit	sentences
As far as I know, avagraha was/is used to indicate true elision of a vowel, most frequently the short "a": e.g. ?????? (for ?: ????). In the examples given, there is no true elision but simply sa?dhi that creates the long ?; we have similar vowel assimilations in a + i = e, and one never put a avagraha to indicate this.
