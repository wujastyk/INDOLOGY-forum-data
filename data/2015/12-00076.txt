Dear Dipak,
Thanks for your answer/opinion.I had to ask the community before considering it an avyutpanna?abda, taking also into consideration a non-OIA origin.
Yours,Vlad

 An OIAetymology, though always possible to invent, will be uncalled for according tome.? It may better pass as an avyutpanna?abda.So also with the etymology of Cheranga/Chowrangi, name of sage associated withHa?hayoga.?

Subject:?Regarding a possible etymology of the name Ghera??a
Dear all,
My access to Indian languages is not so great (besides some Sanskrit & Bengali), so I couldn't figure out any etymology for the name of Ghera??a (??????).
Any suggestion will be much appreciated.
Many thanks and all the bestfrom Bucharest,
Vlad ?ov?rel
