Dear All,
An Indology friend is looking for the Siddh?ntacandrodaya commentary on the Tarkasa?graha written by K???a-dh?rja?i-dik?ita. This was published by Gujarati Printing Press in 1923. Would someone happen to have a scanned copy of this text? Both of us would be highly obliged for this favour.
Best wishes.
Mrinal
