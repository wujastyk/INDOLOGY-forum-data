Dear John,

I don't have the volume at hand here at home, so cannot check it down to the comma, but basically this reference seems accurate --- except that I believe the article was published in Indonesian. The volume Sadur was published by the EFEO branch in Jakarta during my tenure there, in collaboration with the commercial publisher KPG. I can easily obtain a scan of the published version, and probably likewise easily obtain a file of the English original if, as I expect, the latter as such remains unpublished.

I presume you are aware of the following, which is presented as part 2 of the article published in Sadur?


  Worsley, Peter. 2006. ?Cosmopolitan vernacular culture and illustrations of the R?ma story at Ca??i Loro Jonggrang, Prambanan. Part 2: The marriage of the crown prince and the succession in polygamous royal households.? In Anamorphoses: hommage ? Jacques Dumar?ay, edited by Henri Chambert-Loir and Bruno Dagens, 227?42. Paris: Les Indes savantes.
  


Best wishes,

    Dear colleagues,

    

    Does anyone have access to the journal with the article noted below
    (page numbers regrettably unknown), which I cannot track down
    anywhere in Britain.  I would very much appreciate firstly
    confirmation of the accuracy of the reference and secondly, if
    possible, a PDF of the article.

    
    
      Worsley, Peter
