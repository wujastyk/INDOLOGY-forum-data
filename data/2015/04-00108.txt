Dear Suresh,

Many thanks for the information!

I was asking for general information since I had a feeling that some members had been complaining privately about some postings and so wanted to be unsubscribed ? and so on. 

I was wondering why those people wouldn?t just unsubscribe using the technology instead of complaining!

Oh, well. 

I?m not going to unsubscribe myself from this list unless the Committee decides to expel me out for any ?judicial? reason!!! ;-)

Thanks and regards,
V.S.Rajam

Those of us who do not know or do not remember the password for their indology subscription, can use the third block titled "Password Reminder" to remind the password. Once you login into your account with the password you can unsubscribe, or change your delivery options.

Checking this field will cause the changes to be made to every mailing list that you are a member of on list.indology.info <http://list.indology.info/>. Click on List my other subscriptions above to see which other mailing lists you are subscribed to.

Set it to Disabled if you want to stay subscribed, but don't want mail delivered to you for a while (e.g. you're going on vacation). If you disable mail delivery, don't forget to re-enable it when you come back; it will not be automatically re-enabled.
