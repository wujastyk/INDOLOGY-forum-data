[INDOLOGY] How to unsubscribe from Indology?
Dear Suresh,
Many thanks for the information!
I was asking for general information since I had a feeling that some members had been complaining privately about some postings and so wanted to be unsubscribed ? and so on. 
I was wondering why those people wouldn?t just unsubscribe using the technology instead of complaining!
Oh, well. 
I?m not going to unsubscribe myself from this list unless the Committee decides to expel me out for any ?judicial? reason!!! ;-)
Thanks and regards,
V.S.Rajam
