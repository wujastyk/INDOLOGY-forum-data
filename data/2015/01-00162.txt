Regarding the correct translation of the G?yatr?, RV 3.62.10, see: 

(1) Witzel-Got?, VdWR*, Dec. 2013 (sent to publisher already in the Summer of 2009 !):

"Dieses, des Gottes Savitar, 
w?nschenswerte Licht m?chten wir (in uns) setzen,
der unsere Eingebungen antreiben soll." 

= "We wish to put (into us) this desirable light of God Savitar, who shall instigate our insights."


(2) Jamison-Brereton, OUP,  (April 2014): 

"Might we make our own that desirable effulgence of god Savitar, who will rouse forth our insights."


Both recent translations take dh?mahi as Optative, as K. Hoffnann has indicated in his Injunktiv long ago (1967): dh?mahi is definitely not, as usually translated so far and also just now on this list, to be taken from dh? "think deeply"; later: "meditate"?

The subjunctive pracoday?t allows both translations:  "will / shall".  The choice is up to interpretation.

* VdWR; = Verlag de Weltreligionen, Frankfurt/Berlin: Der Rig-Veda, 1st vol 2007, 2nd vol. 2013; two more vols. to follow in due course; vols. Include detailed notes/commentary.

Cheers,
Michael

(One might also remark that it is emended to refer to Ganesha and other deities in almost every puja).  It?s rather nice, but there are many other Vedic verses that are just as nice.  What set this apart?  And why?  George
