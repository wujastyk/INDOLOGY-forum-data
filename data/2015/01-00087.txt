[INDOLOGY] N. Ganesan's Dravidian etymologies for 'makara', etc.
It is interesting that Dr. Rajam should have mentioned Prof. Asko Parpola. I have found an interesting post by Dr. Ganesan. In this he says that Dr. Parpola has changed some of his etymologies based on Dr. Ganesan's input.  https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mintamil/enXUUa3WiAk/2P1pnvPRgdoJ
Having read Dr. Parpola's 2011 article recently, I would be very interested to know if Dr. Parpola has changed the etymologies of words for crocodile from what he postulated in his 2011 paper and, if so, what his current etymologies are.
Thanks in advance.

My good wishes to all for a very happy and productive New Year 2015!
Note: My own computer has been sent in for repair and I'm using an old, unstable, borrowed machine. So, the following is a quick response. I hope to send in my comments once I have a robust computer. The one I'm using now may crash anytime while I'm typing in.

WOW and Bravo, that's all I can say for now about the original article by Dr. Ganesan and the critique from Dr. Palaniappan. 
I am deeply eager to hear responses from our esteemed colleagues, especially from Professors Asko Parpola, M. Witzel, Madhav Deshpande, George Hart, ..., and a savvy engineer Suresh G. (student of Bh. Krishnamurti), and many other scholars such as Jean Luc Chevillard on this list.
I'll share my thoughts when I have a robust computer since I need proper diacritics and a non-failing email client all to type.
Thanks and regards,
V.S. Rajam
