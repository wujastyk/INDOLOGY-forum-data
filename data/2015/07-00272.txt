[INDOLOGY] Does anyone know of Sanskrit works that use	2nd-syllable rhyming?
Dominic,
How about Jayadeva?s works as in https://soundcloud.com/janakiraman/nindati-chandana-by-shree-t-n <https://soundcloud.com/janakiraman/nindati-chandana-by-shree-t-n> . But then, as Hardy notes in Viraha-Bhakti, p. 551, the impact of BhP was already there.
Indira Peterson has published a paper on Muthuswami Dikshitar?s Sanskrit compositions which deals with this second syllable rhyming (?Sanskrit in Carnatic Music: The Songs of Muttusv?mi D?k?ita.? Indo-Iranian Journal, 29, 1986, pp. 183-199). This song may be an example https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwTRB0-JaTc <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwTRB0-JaTc> .
