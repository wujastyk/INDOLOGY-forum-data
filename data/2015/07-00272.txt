Dominic,

How about Jayadeva?s works as in https://soundcloud.com/janakiraman/nindati-chandana-by-shree-t-n <https://soundcloud.com/janakiraman/nindati-chandana-by-shree-t-n> . But then, as Hardy notes in Viraha-Bhakti, p. 551, the impact of BhP was already there.

Indira Peterson has published a paper on Muthuswami Dikshitar?s Sanskrit compositions which deals with this second syllable rhyming (?Sanskrit in Carnatic Music: The Songs of Muttusv?mi D?k?ita.? Indo-Iranian Journal, 29, 1986, pp. 183-199). This song may be an example https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwTRB0-JaTc <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwTRB0-JaTc> .

Regards,
Palaniappan

The work is full of Southern touches, many of which have been pointed out by a variety of scholars over the last century.  Yes, ok, there are also Northern touches, but why should that be surprising for a Southern work ?  The South seems always long to have been more conscious of the North than the North has been of the South.  It is full, for example, of rather long-standing Northern sacred toponyms (Tenkasi = ?Benares of the South?; Madurai = Mathur?, etc.; and, of course Southern rivers are regularly equated with the Ga?g? and Yamun?), whereas there are no old instances of a ?Northern? K??c? or ?r?ra?gam or Chidambam, nor of the "K?ver? of the North?.

But at what time in any part of the Sanskritic world would Vedic literature not have been prestigious and accessible to Veda-knowers seeking to write in a consciously archaising style?

An example will make this clear:
