[INDOLOGY] Hindi v Sanskrit
Coming back to the initial question of dIrgha and atidIrgha sanskrita
samAsas vis-?-vis contemporary Indian languages,
1. In the mythological verse-theatre, yakshagana-theatre and mythological
films in Telugu (as in Kannada and Malayalam),  dIrgha and atidIrgha
sanskrita samAsas are used for the aesthetic effects that are identified in
alankAra s'Astra (such as rItI, vritti etc.). The audience who undergo a
rapture and express it in an outburst of applause are usually the common
public mostly rural, not exposed to Sanskritic or English/modern education.
Even the performers in folk yakshagAna theatre and folk narrative
performing arts who render the dIrgha and atidIrgha sanskrita samAsas do
not have such educations.
2. In satsangs and satsang type religious programs too speakers rendering
such samAsas receive a highly positive reception.
