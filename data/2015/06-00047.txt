[INDOLOGY] Article about the politics surrounding indology at	the IHRC
Interesting. I didn't know that. So if I understand correctly, DC doesn't
think the speakers of OIA came from outside? I understand if he considers
the way the whole 'Aryan invasion/migration' was characterized to have been
racist. But to go the next step and say that no migration ever happened is
silly. But this is precisely what Bharadvaj believes he is going to prove.
So if DC and Bharadvaj have the same view, where is the disagreement? I am
confused again. Best,J
