Publications in this area are appearing with increasing frequency. I have not made any particular effort to keep track of them. The ones I have found sufficiently or more than sufficiently rich are:

Dr. Sampad?nanda Misra, <sampadanandamishra at gmail.com>, of Sri Aurobindo Foundations for Indian Culture (SAFIC), Pondicherry, is doing much innovative work in the field, concentrating especially on young learners.
