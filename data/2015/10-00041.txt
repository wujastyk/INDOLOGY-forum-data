I have myself just achieved a first input (including pada-paa.tha and variant readings of the various editions - I have still to check one before to propose the text on GRETIL - here attached the work as already done) + French translation (a simple new Sanskrit commentary is also planned because I am not always satisfied by the existing ones).
Two noteworthy studies on the work are:
- Ferdinando Belloni-Filippi, "Il Poema Demoniaco (raak.sasakaavyam)", Giornale della societ? america asiatica italiana 19, 1906, pp. 83-102
https://archive.org/stream/GiornaleDellaSocietaAsiaticaItaliana19/Giornale_della_Societa_Asiatica_Italiana_19#page/n95/mode/2up

- P. K. Gode,  "Date of Raak.sasa Kaavya or Kaavyaraak.sasa ? Before A.D. 1000", In: Studies in Indian Literary History vol. 1, pp. 195-202;
orig. publ. in Journal of Indian History, Madras, vol. 19/3, 1940 pp. 312-319
