[INDOLOGY] N. Ganesan's Dravidian etymologies for 'makara', etc.
Dear Dr. Parpola,
Thank you for your clarification. 
You may remember in 2002, during the Harvard Roundtable on Ethnogenesis of South and Central Asia, when Bh. Krishnamurti presented "The Culture of Proto-Dravidian Speakers as Reconstructed from the  Dravidian Etymological Dictionary (DEDR)," Frank Southworth questioned the Proto-Dravidian nature of many of BhK's reconstructions, which were based on words found only in South Dravidian or South and Central Dravidian. BhK did acknowledge that Frank had a point. In your own paper you were right to point out that the cognates of *nek-V? are attested rather narrowly. In the case of 'nakar', considering it a sole survivor from Proto-Dravidian is too speculative. The danger of assuming 'nakar' to be Proto-Dravidian is made clear by Tamil philology. 
Please see the Tamil Lexicon's entries given below.
?????-??? nakar-, 4 v. intr. 1. To creep, as a reptile; ??????. 2. To crawl or move along in a lying or sitting posture, as an infant; ???????. 3. To steal away, skulk; ????????? ?????.
????? nakar, n. < nagara. 1. Town, city; ?????. ???????? ???????? ??????? (?????. 23). 2. [T. nagaru.] House, abode, mansion; ??????. ???????? ??????? ??????? (????. 15). 3. Temple, sacred shrine; ??????. ?????????????? ???? (?????. 6). 4. Palace; ???????. ?????????? ??????? (?????. 27, 200). 5. Dais for performing ceremonies; ?????? ???????? ????. ???? ???????? (????. 2633). 6. A furnished hall or place, decorated for ceremonial functions; ??????? ??? ??????? ???????. ??????? ?????????? (????. 701). 7. Wife; ?????. ????????????????? ??????? ??????? ???? (?????. 8).
The noun nakar is attested from Classical Tamil times. The verb form nakar- is not shown with any old literary attestations. Indeed nakar- in the sense of  '1. To creep, as a reptile; ??????. 2. To crawl or move along in a lying or sitting posture, as an infant; ???????' does not occur in Classical Tamil texts or epics or the eighteen minor works, the Periyapuranam, etc. The only remotely possible occurrence is in T?v?ram 2:19:11.3. Even that is doubtful considering the textual variants given in the Digital T?v?ram. (See http://www.ifpindia.org/digitaldb/site/digital_tevaram/INDEX.HTM)
So it is very doubtful if 'nakar-' has an ancient pedigree, let alone from Proto-Dravidian.
One is led to wonder if the verb nakar- was coined from the noun nakar analogically based on the pair of noun ?r and verb ?r-, which are ancient. See the following from Tamil Lexicon.
????-??? ?r-, 4 v. [M. ?r.] intr. 1. To move slowly; to creep, as an infant; to crawl, as a snake; ???????. ????????? ??????????? (????. ?????????. 11). 2. To spread, circulate, as blood; to extend over a surface, as spots on the skin; ???????. ?????????? ???? ???????? ??? (?????, 1185). 3. To flow, as juice from the sugar-cane; ??????. ???????????? ???????? (?????, 34). 4. To come to close quarters; ???????. ?????? ???????? ??????? (?????. 27, 27, ?????.). 5. To be unloosed, relaxed; ???????. ????????? ??????? (?????. 100). 6. To itch; ??????????. ???????? ???? ??????????.--tr. 1. To mount; ??????. ????????? ???????? ?????? . . . ???????? . . . ???? (???????. 101). 2. To ride, as a horse; to drive, as a vehicle; ????????????. ?????? ?????????? ???????????? (?????, 37). 
???? ?r, n. < ????-. 1. Going, riding; ?????. ?????????????????????????? (??????. ????. 43). 2. [T. Tu. ?ru, K. M. ?r.] Village, town, city; ????????? ???. (????. ??. 37.) 3. Place; ????. ??? ???????? ???????????? (????. 2087). 4. Resident population; ???????????. ??? ?????? ?????????? (????. ??. 563). 5. Halo round the sun or moon; ??????????????? ?????? ????????. ????????? ???????? ????????? (??????. ?????. 9)
Indeed Akan????u 306. 6 has a tortoise moving slowly up a sugarcane. If you compare the verbs nakar- and ?r-, one can see the semantic equivalence. The verb ?r-, noun ?r, and noun nakar have a long history of literary attestations. (Th verb ?r- (DEDR 749) is also attested in Tamil, Malayalam, and Konda.) The verb nakar- seems be of a much later coinage. 
In other words, not only is nakar- not attested in languages other than Tamil, but even in Tamil, it is very late. So, in my opinion, Ganesan's proposal of *nakar as a Proto-Dravidian word for crocodile is not an acceptable etymology for Sanskrit nakra, etc.

I told Ganesan that Tamil nakar 'to creep (as a reptile), to crawl (as
an infant), to sneak away' (TL), to which he had drawn my
attention, might be the sole survivor of Proto-Dravidian *nakar
and in that case a better etymology for Sanskrit
nakra etc. and Proto-Dravidian *nekaL than Proto-Dravidian
*neka- (DEDR 3730) that I proposed on p. 19 of my crocodile
paper (2011).
