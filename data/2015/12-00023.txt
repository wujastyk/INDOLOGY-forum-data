[INDOLOGY] Epigraphia Indica
Dear Ken,
     The same thing happened to me while downloading the torrent, but then
I shut of the downloader Vuze, and found that all the files had been
actually downloaded.  After downloading 99.96, Vuze went into the uploading
mode and was uploading something from my hard-drive, which got me worried.
But, in any case, all the files were downloaded in the Vuze folder in
Documents on my Mac.
