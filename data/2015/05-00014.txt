[INDOLOGY] Uberoi Seminar at Shawnee State University
Call for papers: Deadline Approaching Soon (May 29, 2015)
*Call for Papers*
*Uberoi Seminar at Shawnee State University, OHIO, USA*
We are excited to announce the interdisciplinary conference, *Indian
Cultural Heritage in the Global Age*, which will take place at The Shawnee
State University, Portsmouth, Ohio, October 29-30, 2015. The conference
brings together academic research on India, its religious and cultural
history. India is home to a number of religions such as Hinduism, Buddhism,
Jainism, and Sikhism collectively referred to as the Dharma traditions. As
India gains economic momemtum and enters the global arena, its cultural
traditions and religious practices adopt to change, and reach countries
outside of India. While Yoga, and Vegetarianism are ubiquitous with India,
other aspects of Indian culture are not as well known. In a global world,
it is more than ever necessary to understand India, its culture and
religions.  Hence we seek papers on all aspects of Indian culture and
religions.
Additionally, selected papers will be included in a collection of essays
resulting from the conference.
Please send a 350-word abstract and brief (one paragraph maximum) bio to
lvemsani at shawnee.edu by May 29, 2015 (11:59pm). Notifications of acceptance
will be sent by June  29, 2015 and the program will be announced by July
29, 2015.
