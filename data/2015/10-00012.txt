[INDOLOGY] Best way to type Sanskrit in Windows?
Dear Dean,
I have been using this one: https://sites.google.com/site/bhashaime/
It supports also 2 transliteration schemes and many other Indian scripts,
and works fine when shifting from English to one of the scripts, not so
well when I'm using my native Portuguese though.
best
