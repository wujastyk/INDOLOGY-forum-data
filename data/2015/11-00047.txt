You can find this and other IAST version of the metrically restored RV at:

This is the form of the original Gayatri mantra from the Rg Veda but later
gayatri mantras follow a different form.

1) Are the Gayatri mantras from the Taittir?ya ?ra?yaka book 10
(Mah?n?r?ya?a Upani?ad) the earliest Gayatri mantras in this later form.?
Given the sacredness afforded to the Gayatri mantra from the Rg Veda, does
any of the Sanskrit literature say anything about why the later Gayatri
mantras follow this different form?
Thanks,
