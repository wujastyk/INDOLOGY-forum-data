Subject: [INDOLOGY] training in poetic composition in traditional Sanskrit	education?

In Sanskrit Finals, composition is no longer mandatory. For the BA
students, it is one option among many others for the so-called special
subject (1 paper), chosen area (2 papers), or a potential dissertation
(instead of the special subject paper). The core syllabus remains roughly
the same (6 papers: 2 papers for subsidiary language; Panini, Vedic,
general essay paper on history/literature/arts with additional input from
special subject; and unseen translations).

I took Finals in 2012. Richard Gombrich was/is still active and around, but
my main Sanskrit teachers were Chris Minkowski, Jim Benson, Alexis
Sanderson, Jowita Kramer, and Csaba Dezs?.

With my best wishes,
Paul Gerstmayr
