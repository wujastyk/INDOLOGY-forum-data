Greetings,

I am looking for an edition (digital or otherwise) of the entire ?g Veda
which has been parsed (syntactic, semantic and morphological). In case
anyone is aware of any such edition or part thereof I would much appreciate
further information therewith.

With Kindest Wishes,

Martin Gluckman
