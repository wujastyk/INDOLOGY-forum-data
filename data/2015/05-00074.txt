[INDOLOGY] Sources for verses on fate/karma
Balabhadra in the early 17th century quotes several verses on the topic 
of niyati/daiva and karma. I have found some of these in other works but 
not others, and even for the ones I have found, I suspect there are 
earlier or more common sources. Any help with attributing the following 
would be much appreciated:
1. Attributed to ?aunaka:
yena tu yat pr?ptavya? tasya vidh?na? sure?asacivo ?pi |
ya? s?k??n niyatij?a? so ?pi na ?akyo ?nyath? kartum || iti |
2. No attribution, but found (with variants) in Pa?cada?? 156 and 
Mah?subh??itasa?graha 3283:
ava?yambh?vibh?v?n?? prat?k?ro bhaved yadi |
tad? du?khair na b?dhyeran nalar?mayudhi??hir?? ||
3. No attribution, but apparently popular -- found (with variants) in 
N?radapur??a 1.31.69 and 2.29.18 and Mah?subh??itasa?graha 3292 (also 
quoted in ?yurvedad?pik? and Satya??sanapar?k??); the question is what 
would be either the earliest source or the most common/typical one in 
the early 1600s:
n?bhukta? k??yate karma kalpako?i?atair api |
ava?yam eva bhoktavya? k?ta? karma ?ubh??ubham ||
4. Attributed simply to sm?ti:
hanyate durbala? daiva? pauru?e?a vipa?cit?
Many thanks in advance!
