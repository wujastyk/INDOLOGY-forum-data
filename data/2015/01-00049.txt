Dear Jan,



Lee Siegel, *Laughing matters: comic tradition in India*. Chicago:
University of Chicago Press, 1987 deals extensively with satire as a genre
in Sanskrit literature.



A narrative that Siegel does not treat is the Pa?catantra story ?The Weaver
as Vi??u? in the recension of the PT that Hertel ?the more simple
text? (*textus
simplicior*). The same story appears in a strongly censored version in
P?r?abhadra?s recension of the PT (completed on January 17, 1199), the
so-called *textus ornatior*. I analyze the two versions in an article that
will appear soon in *Wiener Zeitschrift f?r die Kunde S?dasiens* 57.



Best,



Philipp
