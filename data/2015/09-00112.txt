[INDOLOGY] two papers
Dear colleagues,
Would anyone be able to furnish pdfs of the following two papers?
  Kulke, Hermann. 1976. ?Kshatriyaization and Social Change: A Study in Orissa Setting.? In Aspects of Changing India: Studies in Honour of Prof. G.S. Ghurye, edited by S. Devadas Pillai, 376?85. Bombay: Popular Prakashan.
Eschmann, Anncharlott. 1978. ?Hinduization of Tribal Deities in Orissa: The ??kta and ?aiva Typology.? In The Cult of Jagannath and the Regional Tradition of Orissa, edited by Anncharlott Eschmann, Hermann Kulke, and Gaya Charan Tripathi, 79?97. South Asian Studies 8. New Delhi: Manohar.
The first is entirely unknown and unavailable to me; the second I have in a reprint of the Jagannath volume but this reprint is quite bad for this article and will not allow me to make a scan that I can furnish to students. I am hoping someone else already has a good scan.
I believe there was a thread less than a year ago where various concepts such as Sanskritization came under discussion. I have a vague recollection that some useful references were supplied but I cannot now trace that thread. Can anybody help?
Thank you very much.
