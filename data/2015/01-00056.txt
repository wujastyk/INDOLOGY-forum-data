I am just writing a note on bhautopaakhyaana (appears also as  
bhautaakhyaana). These are short anecdotes about dumb and dumber used  
by philosophers to illustrate the stupidity of their opponents. The  
structure is invariably the same: One fool asks a stupid question or  
makes a stupid statement, and another fool, who claims to correct or  
instruct him, makes an even more stupid statement.
I have found very few of those; two in the Pramanavarttikabhashya (one  
of which is repeated by Shanti Suri), one in Jnanasrimitra's work, and  
one in Udayana's Aatmatattvaviveka. If anyone knows of more, I will be  
grateful for any references.

As for satires in Hindi, I have found Taj Mahal ka Tender, translated  
by Oranskaya and her students, very funny. It places the building of  
the Taj Mahal in modern India and of course the actual work never  
begins (the money is embezzled, used for bribes, unnecessary  
administration and so on).
