[INDOLOGY] Satirical criticism in Sanskrit literature and	philosophy?
I do not know if *Jan E.M. Houben* was intending coverage of Indian
literature in other Indian languages too and whether he intended the modern
period too.
If he did, this is huge in various Indian languages of various periods,
particularly modern period.
Some posts covered Hindi and modern period.
  I would share from Telugu. But was that intended?
