Subject: use of 'sarga' in referring to many individuals
Message-ID: <F97CCF0C-6FCD-4EB9-958E-A1D767F1D6DA@aol.com>

A Tamil inscription refers to 15 persons of cava??a (savar?a) carukkam (sarga) of Karuv?r. How do the Sanskritists here understand the use of ?sarga? in this inscription? Are there similar uses in Sanskrit texts?

Thanks in advance
