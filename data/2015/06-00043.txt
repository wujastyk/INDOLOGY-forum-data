[INDOLOGY] Article about the politics surrounding indology at	the IHRC
Jesse atrributes to Bharadwaja the following argument, which I will state formally to facilitate clear analysis. (I believe that Jesse?s argument entails and requires an unstated premise 2.
Premise 1:  Anything good (especially in South Asia) must originate in the womb of Bharata Mata.
Premise 2 (Implied): Old Indo-Aryan culture is the original culture of Bharata Mata.
Premise 3: The Indus Valley Civilization is good.
Conclusion: Therefore the IVC must come from Bharata Mata?s original, defining Vedic culture.
If Bharadwaja makes this argument, then one might describe his view as ?extremely racist and chauvanistic.? 
To argue for a greater antiquity for the Vedas, or or to explore possible connections between the IVC and the Vedic civilization, is not in and of itself a racist or chauvanist project, nor is it necessarily a sign of hopeless obscurantism.
Best,
Howard
