[INDOLOGY] rubrication in Indian mss.
Dear colleagues,
When do we first see rubrication in Indian manuscripts? And can you send me any links to
images of early examples? Of course, vermilion was known and used in many contexts,
but here I am particularly interested in its use in writing.
with thanks in advance,
Matthew
