[INDOLOGY] Indian printed books
Dear All,
while we are on this topic,
and since Rosane Rocher has pointed out the fact that the Book provided 
by Emmanuel Francis is the catalogue of a private collection,
I would very much like to know
whether the calalogue of another private collection
(see below)
is available in digital form somewhere.
A few years ago,
while visiting the British Library,
I had the pleasure a examining a fascinating book,
in which the title page said
(this is copied from my handwritten notes of that day)
**************************************
CATALOGUE

VALUABLE LIBRARY

Dr Arthur Coke Burnell, C.I.E.
(Sold by order of the Executors)

Especially to the East Indies and to America;
Numerous Dictionaries and Grammars;
Bibliographical Publications;
and a very extensive collection of
Oriental and East Indian Literature.
Which will be sold by Auction

At one o'clock precisely.

***************************************
That copy of catalogue
has a STAMP on it, which reads
"India Office"
"20 AUG 1914"
"Library"
*******************
I copied by hand enough information to fill 10 pages
in a notebook, but that cannot replace an exact reproduction.
(Is there a PDF on Archive.org? I would like to know)
I would also be curious to know what was the fate of Burnell's book:
How many people bought them? Are they now traceable?
Arthur Coke Burnell (1840-1882) is certainly a fascinating character!
Thanks for any pointers
