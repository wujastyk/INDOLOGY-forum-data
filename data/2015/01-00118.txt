Wu Juan?s copy being clearer and more complete, I have taken the liberty of using it to replace the one I uploaded to Archive.  If you fetched that one, you will want to replace it.  The link remains the same:

(It is uploading now, 46 MB, and should be ready within a few minutes.)

I have so far sought in vain for a scan of this work online. Can anyone oblige?
Thank you and best wishes,
