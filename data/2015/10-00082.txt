[INDOLOGY] SanskritVerb - A verb form generator
Dear scholars,
We are happy to present before you our project *SanskritVerb* - a
computational simulation of step by step Sanskrit verb form generation
(???????????????).
*Expected outcome* -
1. The code gives step by step derivation of all forms of a given verb in
given tense.
2. The code gives a derived table at the end.
*Source code* - https://github.com/drdhaval2785/SanskritVerb
*Online testing* -

*N.B.* -
1. Currently the machine doesn't create sanAdi verb forms. It will be
included in later versions.
2. Bug reports are welcome at
https://github.com/drdhaval2785/SanskritVerb/issues
3. We have relied upon the following books - (1) Ashtadhyayi sahajabodha by
Dr. Pushpa Dikshit, (2) Siddhantakaumudi with Balamanorama commentary and
(3) Kashikavritti.
4. Current version is version 1.1.0 (
