I agree with Prof. Mathew Kapstein.

The word Siddha has several meanings in several contexts.

The term JIvanmukta too has a huge shades of meaning and a wide varieties
of discussion.

There are very small number of occasions the two terms can turn almost
synonymous to each other.

Siddha : 1. The one who has achieved one of the ashTa siddhis. 2. One of
the (usually seven) devata jatis. 3. A respectable member of the Tamil
siddha tradition. 4. A guru of the Shaiva particularly Vira shaiva
tradition 5. In the modern theosophical tradition, the one translated into
English as a Master. The list goes on.

JIvanmukta : I shall continue in my next post.
