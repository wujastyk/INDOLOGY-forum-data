At the risk of being perceived as 'aggressive in tone' again, I would
like to quote, in humble respect towards my readers, what I wrote

"What we see in the case of Malhotra is not mere conscious copying, but
also tinkering with the precise wording. One cannot do this if one
honestly wishes to quote another author."
