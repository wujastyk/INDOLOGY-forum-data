=?utf-8?Q?Re:_[INDOLOGY]=09Two_additional_recensions_of_the_=E1=B9=9Agveda_available?=
The first thing that was noticed by the editor of the the ??val?yana-Sa?hit?,
B. B. Chaubey, is that the khilas, long known and often published as an
appendix to editions of the ?gveda, are almost all found incorporated in
the hymns of the ??val?yana recension. They are apocrypha only for the ??kala
recension. They are genuine ?gveda mantras, as shown by their presence
within the ??val?yana-Sa?hit?.
Both of the newly published recensions include their own pada-p??ha. In his
extensive introduction, Chaubey stated that the 212 additional mantras not
found in ??kala recension are not given in ??val?yana pada-p??ha
manuscripts. He therefore, after learning its different method of showing
the avagraha, supplied them himself (p. 57).
Here is my question, that perhaps someone in India with access either to
the manuscripts or to the editors can answer. In hymn 10.121 addressed to
hira?ya-garbha, the last verse, verse 10, brings in Praj?pati. Vedic
scholars such as Jan Gonda have questioned the authenticity of this verse
because its words are not separated in the pada-p??ha (WZKS 27, 1983, p.
31). In both of the newly published recensions, this verse has a full pada-p
??ha. So, was the pada-p??ha for this verse prepared and added by Chaubey
to his edition of the ??val?yana recension? And perhaps then copied by Amal
Dhari Singh Gautam for his edition of the ???kh?yana recension? Or is it in
fact found in manuscripts of the pada-p??ha of the ??val?yana and/or the ??
?kh?yana recension?
