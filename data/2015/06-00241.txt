Dear Suresh
That was the point I was making: that hares, but not rabbits, are native to India. (The same is true of the UK, but our rabbits were introduced quite early, probably in Roman times.) It sounds as though the Sanskrit word for hare has been generalised to cover leporids in general, while English has kept the cognate IE word just for the hare and added the word ?rabbit? (of unknown origin) for the introduced species.
