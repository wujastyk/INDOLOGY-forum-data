[INDOLOGY] text reuse
Just a few additional pointers closer to the field of Indology:
contributions to a panel on the reuse of texts in Indian Philosophy have
recently been published in the Journal of Indian Philosophy 43/2-3
(http://link.springer.com/journal/10781/43/2/page/1).
Elisa Freschi's introduction is published Open Access and can be
downloaded here:

And while we're on the subject, the forthcoming issue 36-37 of the
Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies contains a
section on "Authors and Editors in the ?Literary ?Traditions of Asian
Buddhism", guest-edited by Cathy Cantwell, Jowita Kramer, Robert Mayer,
and Stefano Zacchetti. Several papers published in that section touch
upon issues of intertextuality and authorship.
With best wishes,
