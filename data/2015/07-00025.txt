[INDOLOGY] Religious Literature with Political Purposes
Dear Prof. Paturi,
Right, in the early stages of the theory's development.
By now it's the theory of social/cultural exchange. Active, bidirectional
exchange involving the "class" and the "non-class", emulations and
incorporations.
Dialogue.
Best,
Artur Karp
