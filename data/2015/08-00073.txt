=?utf-8?Q?[INDOLOGY]_Mattavil=C4=81sa_Prahasana?=
Dear All,
A quick google search tells me that there is at least one edition of the
Mattavil?sa Prahasana and several (?) translations and theratical
adaptations published. Would someone happen to have any PDF/s of the
edition, translation and/or theatrical adaptations? I would be happy if you
can share them.
Best wishes.
