SUMMARY: 
The monograph "Indian Lexicography" by the late Professor Claus Vogel 
(1933?2012), who taught indology at the University of Bonn, contains a 
literary-historical survey of the Indian lexicographical literature in Sanskrit. 
This book appeared first in 1979 in the "History of Indian Literature" Series 
and has remained since then the unsurpassed standard work on this subject.   
In the course of time the author had been collecting additional notes and 
corrections which he initially planned to publish separately in a small booklet. 
When the "Indian Lexicography" went out of print, however, the publishers 
of the "Indologica Marpurgensia" Series proposed to him to prepare instead 
a revised edition of his work. Professor Vogel happily consented, and as a 
result now an updated authorized version of this standard book has been 
released.
