[INDOLOGY] Indian printed books
I am not sure about Burnell's library of printed books, but his manuscript collection was acquired by the India Office Library (now part of the British Library) and they are catalogued in A. B. Keith's Catalogue of Sanskrit and Pr?krit Manuscripts in the LIbrary of the India Office, Oxford, 1935.
