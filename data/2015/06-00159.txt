[INDOLOGY] prof. or mr. or mrs. or ms. etc first name
But there is also the typically British titles, where it is Lord + surname; and Sir + first name: Sir Winston, or Sir Winston Churchill, but not Sir Churchill.
So it may be entirely possible for Indians to create a new idiom: Mr. Patrick, as I am so frequently called.
