[INDOLOGY] Article by Jean Filliozat
Dear Dominik, Dear Colleagues,
Another, English version of the article on psychotropes by Jean Filliozat
was included in his Indian *Opera minora* (MLBD 1991) on *Religion
Philosophy Yoga*. Professor Pierre-Sylvain Filliozat wrote to me in July
2014:
It is not a perfectly authentic article of my father. He had done a lecture
on this subject in a Yoga school in Paris. It was recorded and published in
the Newsletter of that school from the recording. Please find the files in
attachment.
Yours sincerely,
Eugen Ciurtin
