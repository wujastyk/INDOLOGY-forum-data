[INDOLOGY] Religious Literature with Political Purposes
Dear Prof. Hart,
I stand corrected. Or - do I?
In fact - why these terms should be avoided? The question of political
correctness? It seems to be, considering your opinion that "these words
have long been used to marginalize, demean, and patronize various ethnic
groups". I personally do not share your conviction. The Constitution of the
Indian Republic recognizes 645 "district tribes" formally enumerated  in
the list of Scheduled Tribes in India. Although it is understood that the
term "Scheduled Tribes" is equivalent to "indigenous peoples", the term
"tribe" is formally used.
Is the term "indigenous" less nebulous than the term "tribal"? I am, again,
not convinced. But, that may be the question of my un-English linguistic
heritage.
fact
cultures are quite as complex and sophisticated as the Brahmanical culture
Let me ask a straightforward (and possibly naive) question: have you ever
heard a statement in which the use of the term "tribal" was meant,
consciously, to rob the "indigenous peoples" of their humanity?
Should we re-edit Gandhi's and Ambedkar's works, and insert "Dalits" in
place of "untouchables". What about the "practices of untouchability"?
Should we, from now on, speak about the "practices of Dalitness/Dalithood"?
What, pray, is "n-word" supposed to mean?
Finally, it is the Sanskritic term "upa-jati" that was formed and is used
to define the "tribals/indigenous peoples" as groups of lower, of
sub-status. Is there a tendency to use some other, less demeaning
Sanskritic term to describe these groups?
Best,
