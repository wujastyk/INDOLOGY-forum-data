[INDOLOGY] rubrication in Indian mss.
Can the following verse from the Kum?ra-sambhava?  be taken as having an
oblique reference to rubrication? [Unless we take the second p?da to be a
qualifier for the rikta version of the bh?rja-patra]
nyast?k?ar? dh?tu-rasena yatra bh?rja-tvacah kunjara-bindu-?o??? |
vrajanti vidy?dhara-sundar??am'ananga-lekha-kriyayo'payogam ||  1.7 ||
