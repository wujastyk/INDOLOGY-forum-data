[INDOLOGY] Politics of ICHR: Indian linguists
23 06 15
There was no desire on my part to sermonize as Dr. Elst tries to hint. The
facts were relevant.
A generalization of the knowledge of Varanasi or of Tirupati or of any
religious centre does not give a picture of India. The given observations
are in absolute terms. One might ask : where was comparative linguistics
before Bopp? It is seeing the present in the past with generalization
verging on stigmatization that sees a modern branch of knowledge existing
in Europe from time immemorial and the absence thereof in some non-Western
country. I would not have to make any observation if there was no searching
of the cause for lack of this and that among Indians.
It is ridiculous to expect the knowledge of various European languages
among Indians just as it is to expect the knowledge of various Indian
languages among Europeans. What picture will emerge if comparison were made
between Indians speaking German or French or Europeans speaking Hindi or
Tamil? Though educationally backward India will not give an unfavorable
picture.
I think we should now desist from the debate. At least I will.
Best wishes
