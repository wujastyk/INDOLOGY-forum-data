[INDOLOGY] Article about the politics surrounding indology at	the IHRC
It seems to me that Chakrabarti was expressing a very reasonable
frustration with Bharadwaj's attempt to revive that long dead horse: the
Aryan migration theory.  I agree with Geoffrey that Chakrabarti should take
care not to speak too bluntly about this.
Best wishes,
