[INDOLOGY] corrected version: Indology and plagiarism: specify stance in order to fortify "brand name" (and conclude lengthy threads)
Dear Professor Bhattacharya,
Just for the sake of keeping up the standard of the discipline
(??stra?uddhyartham),
would it not be useful to give more details on the publication in which
your chapters were plagiarized and on the publisher where it appeared ? I
do not want to force since from experience we know that revealing cases of
plagiarism is not without the risk of receiving severe and angry criticism.
I hope your valuable work on Mythological and ritual symbolism will see an
updated second edition.
