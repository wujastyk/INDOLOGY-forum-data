[INDOLOGY] University of Tokyo Sanskrit MSS back online
I have just learned that the website from the University of Tokyo, which
was inaccessible for quite a long time, has come back online:
http://utlsktms.ioc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/
It is true that the implementation at present is entirely in Japanese, but
even so it is pretty easy to navigate with a bit of common sense, I would
think, and then one can see, freely, a large number of Skt MSS in the Tokyo
University library.
