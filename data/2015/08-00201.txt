Dear Arlo,
     In his Sanskrit introduction to the first volume of the Nirnayasagara
edition of Pata?jali's Vy?kara?a-Mah?bh??ya (1917, p. 16, fn 5), the editor
Shivadatta Kuddala says that this verse is from Par??ara-Upapur??a.  The
same source is given for the traditional definitions of S?tra and V?rttika.
(Kudd?la, Intro, p. 12 and 14).  For the definition of S?tra, Kudd?la also
refers to Vi???dharmottara (ibid, p. 12).  On p. 11 of his Introduction,
Kudd?la quotes the following verse from Par??ara-Upapur??a:
     p??in?ya? mah???stra? padas?dhutvalak?a?am /
     sarvopak?raka? gr?hya? k?tsna? ty?jya? na ki?cana //
