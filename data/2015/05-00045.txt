[INDOLOGY] query [regarding the correct version of a	defectively cited verse]
Dear Patrick, Ashok, and colleagues:
perhaps ?divi? instead of ?divo? is likely?
Also, it might be worth pointing out the possible influence of two parallel ?y?vad r?makath?? verses in the epics, in both instances used to justify Hanuman?s long life (to go on as long as the R?makath? is told/heard in the world): Mbh 3.147.37 and R?m 7.39.16.
All best wishes,
Adheesh
