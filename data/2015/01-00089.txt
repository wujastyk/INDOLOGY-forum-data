[INDOLOGY] N. Ganesan's Dravidian etymologies for 'makara', etc.
Palaniappan,
I do not know what the interaction between Parpola and Ganesan has been in
the past, but Parpola's 2011 paper already has some of the ideas discussed
in Ganesan's paper. For instance, the following two paragraphs -- which I
find very problematic -- attempt to connect mucali 'crocodile' with *m?k-
'to eat' and m?c- 'to cut'
    This Proto-Dravidian etymon may be derived
from  a  verbal root preserved only in North
Dravidian *m?c- 'to cut (meat), to cut up into
convenient pieces any object too large for use'
(DEDR 5130). This verb, which describes quite
well what a crocodile does after catching a victim
that is too large to be directly swallowed, seems
to be related to the Proto-Dravidian verbal root
*m?k-/mokk-/*mok- 'to eat, to eat greedily in large
mouthfuls, eat voraciously, devour, gobble, swallow'
(DEDR 5127 + 4897). Tamil has derived moci- 'to
eat' from this root.
     This word for 'crocodile' may originally have
been a compound involving two roots, the latter
being Proto-Dravidian *alacu, *alay 'to shake or
agitate in water (e.g., to rinse clothes or vegetables)'
(DEDR 246), which is undoubtedly related to the
root *ala?ku/*alakku, *alay 'to move, shake, wave,
go to and fro for an object, roam, wander' (DEDR
240). This etymological interpretation, however,
necessitates a slight revision of Krishnamurti's
Proto-Dravidian reconstruction (2003: 13, 531),
which is *m?c-V-?- / *moc-V-?-. The compound
nicely complements the first verb by describing the
characteristic behaviour of the marsh and saltwater
crocodile noted above (i.e., victims caught on land
are dragged to the water and swallowed whole, while
large prey is torn to pieces by means of twisting and
shaking motions).
Besides connecting m?c- with m?k-, the attempt to connect with alay- 'to
shake' is extremely problematic, as it totally disregards retroflex /?/ in
several languages such as Kota *moca?*, Kannada *mosa?e, masa?e*, Tulu *mosa?e,
muda?e*.
In my personal communcation with Ganesan (about 3 years ago), I pointed out
how his paper uses several linguistically questionable statements and
unsubstantiated opinions as well-established facts, making it excessively
speculative and wishful thinking.
I think what is required is not a piecemeal analysis of words, but a
comprehensive investigation animal names, plant names and other biota
collected from all the languages of South Asia, for a deeper understanding
of the linguistic prehistory of the subcontinent.
Regards,
Suresh.
