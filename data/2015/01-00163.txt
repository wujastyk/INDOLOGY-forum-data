Subject: [INDOLOGY] Vedic verse in Ortega y Gasset
Message-ID: <CAJGj9eaKkQRip9MBL5FtPxbW8GMFwMBpxD4v7EASvKtvsTpvcQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Prof. Witzel,

I really liked the two translations : 1. We wish to put (into us)
(Witzel-Got?) 2. Might we make our own  (Jamison-Brereton) for dh?mahi .

May I know what is so compelling in the word dh?mahi  that makes you say,

 "dh?mahi is definitely not, as usually translated so far and also just now
on this list, to be taken from dh? "think deeply"; later: "meditate"?"

Thanks

Regards,

Nagaraj
