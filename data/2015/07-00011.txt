[INDOLOGY] request for Russian pdf
Dear colleagues,
Although Vasili'ev's ???????, ??? ???????, ??????? ? ??????????
seems to be available in pdf from several Russian sites, all that I
have found so far require some sort of pre-inscription and/or payment,
and because my Russian is rudimentary, I am wary of using such sites for
download.
I would be most grateful, therefore, to whomever might be able to
send me a pdf of the work in question.
with thanks and best regards,
Matthew
