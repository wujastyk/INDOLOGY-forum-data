Dear Harry,
Two editions have been done, but neither is widely available:
1. K?kaca????varakalpatantra, ed. R. Sharma. Kashi Sanskrit Series 73. Benares. 1929.
2. Ka?kacan?d?i?s?varakalpatantra : text with English translationAuthor:	Ka?kacan?d?i?s?vara.; Gyanendra Pandey, (Medical scientist)Publisher: Varanasi : Chowkhamba Sanskrit Series Office, 2003.Series: Chowkhamba Sanskrit studies, v. 121.
Jan Meulenbeld's History of Indian Medical Literature (2A, pp. 608-12) indicates that the K?kaca????varakalpatantra and K?kaca????varamata are two different works. The NCC (vol. 3) appears to conflate their manuscripts.
Best wishes,
Jason

Thank you for this Jason.  A quick look at the NGMCP on-line title list  shows 7 manuscripts of the k?kaca??e?var?mata but no texts called  k?kaca??e?varakalpatantra .Does Gordon White say anything about where the manuscript or manuscripts of a text called   k?kaca??e?varakalpatantra are located.
