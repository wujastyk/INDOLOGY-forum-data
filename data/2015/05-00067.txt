Dear Colleagues,
Can anybody help me by providing a scan of the following short article? 
I was not able to find it online and our library does not have the 
journal.
Acharya, Baburam and Naya Raj Pant
1953 'Mallasamay?bhilekha? (vi. sa?. 1444),' [A Malla-period
inscription (1387)). Sa?skrta-sande?a 1:8 (V.S. 2010
Marga): 46-48.
Thank you in advance!
Camillo A. Formigatti
