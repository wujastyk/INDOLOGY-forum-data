[INDOLOGY] The so-called German Indology
My comment was written before I saw Reinhold's comment.  My original remark
was less a matter of supporting ("acclamation") George Hart's remarks
(which I do support), then it was a matter of drawing our attention to the
fact that Americans have struggled with their academic heritage, and in
particular, with the precise sense of "wissenschaftlich."
