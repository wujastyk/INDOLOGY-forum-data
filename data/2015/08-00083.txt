not an edition, and I don't have this right in front of me, but I remember
this as being an excellent translation: David N. Lorenzen, "A Parody of the
Kapalikas in the Mattavilasa," in Tantra in Practice, ed. D. G. White,

ah, who needs actual books?
thanks to the mega-monster google:
https://books.google.nl/books?id=hayV4o50eUEC&pg=PA84&lpg=PA84&dq=MattaVilasa+lorenzen+david&source=bl&ots=ZiRnwxEXjc&sig=jRvTGA0X7GkutgIYAFgcvS0JtSY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCwQ6AEwAmoVChMI1MLKgIifxwIVgdcaCh2QgwA8#v=onepage&q=MattaVilasa%20lorenzen%20david&f=false

there are not even any suppressed pages here!
