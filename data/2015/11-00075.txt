[INDOLOGY] Query
Dear Patrick,
Historically, long compounds seem to have begun with dvandvas. The relationship of the constituents is uniform and easiest to understand in a dvandva. There is no syntactic complexity. Essentially all one does is to list. In the Artha-??stra, too, almost all long compounds are dvandvas. In verse texts like the Y?j?avalkya Sm?ti the only additional constraint is to rearrange the items in such a way as to fit the expected sequence of heavy and light syllables. In the ?loka or anu??ubh metre such rearranging is not very difficult to achieve. 
Best.
