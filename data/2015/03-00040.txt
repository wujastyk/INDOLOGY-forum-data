[INDOLOGY] Concept of kIlakam in mantrazAstra
Can any of the list members point out any references either in the tantric
literature or in scholarly articles where the concept of kIlakam is
discussed.
I.e. where in the introductory verse to a mantra or stotra it says
something like:
"For this mantra X is the bijaH, Y is the zAktiH, Z is the devatA, U is the
kIlakam, "
a discussion of what is meant the "kIlakam" of the mantra.
Thanks,
Harry Spier
