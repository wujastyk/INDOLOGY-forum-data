Subject: [INDOLOGY] Texts with different topics by one author

I don't have a good list of names to suggest, but I just want to say that
this request suggests that you are at the stage of testing some algorithms
for determining authorship, and this is very very exciting!!
Genre-wise it does not really meet your requirements, but you might think
(I would hope you would think) of Vasubandhu as a future 'test case'.
