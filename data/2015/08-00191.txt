The bodily metaphor apparently referring to the Vedas (not named as such) is also attested in 1600 in
Jo?o de Lucena, Historia da vida do padre Francisco de Xavier, p. 95 (col. 1, after his account of the Gerodam language ; the rest of the passage is also interesting). To be read at:

Ezour-Vedam")], samam, edaruna?", with the note by Charpentier p. 217-8 (VII n. 2): "Brahmaa and the four vedas: this is one of the oldest passages in European literature mentioning by name the different Vedas (cp. on older European lit. dealing with the Vedas [W.] CALAND Ontdekkungsgeschiedenis [van de Veda, In: Verslagen en Mededeelingen der Koninklijke Akademie van Wetenschappen, Afdeeling Letterkunde, Vijfde Reeks, vol.

> I add in attachment for the list the English translation by I. Zupanov (a .pdf publication which was available on-line, linked to the Conference Portugal I?ndico held in Brown University in May 2002) of an extract of the Treatise (Tratado) by Father Gon?alo Fernandes Trancoso s.j. (1541-1621), a colleague of de Nobili who lived on the Fishery Coast and in Madurai, dealing also with the four Vedas in more details. The treatise refers elsewhere to brahmins experts in Girantao (grantha), to Vedic texts of Baudh?yana (Potuien... doutor grave "important doctor"), ??val?yana, Apastamba (Abasten), ?ra.nyaka (Arenako), Yajurveda (Eihirvedao), and to several Vedic rituals.

>> Christophe ? I think Fenicio mentions the term Veda only in relation to a Vedic mantra recited while consuming panchagavya (I think - I have only my notes on Charpentier's edition (does anyone have a pdf?), which in any case according to Paolo Aranha omits a large part of the original ms). But Ludo Rocher argues (Puranas, 1986: 11) that Fenicio's primary sources were puranic, and that this is even made explicit in the title of a Latin translation of Fenicio: Collectio omnium dogmatum & arcanorum ex Puranis seu libris Canonicis paganorum Indianorum... 
>> 
>> Part of my argument in the article I'm preparing is that despite many references to the Vedas as the most authoritative Indian sacred texts, other texts were almost invariably the actual source. Azevedo, for instance, having mentioned the Vedas as the original texts then goes on to cite exclusively Tamil sources (Tirumantiram, Tiruv?cakam, Tiv?karam, Tirukku?a? and another Tamil text on caste). 
>> 
>> Thanks also for the references to the texts acquired by the Jesuits (stolen on their behalf by a convert, it appears) in the 1550s. On the basis of fragments of translations of these done by the convert (a Brahmin baptised as Manuel Olivera) which were sent to Europe and are extant in Portugal and Goa, Ines Zupanov and Angela Barreto Xavier have identified these as J??ne?vara?s Marathi version of Bhagavad-G?t?, a purana by N?mdev, and parts of the Mah?bh?rata.  Also in Portugal are three manuscripts containing parts of the Mah?bh?rata and R?may??a in Konkani prose and Marathi verse, transliterated into Roman script by Jesuits around the same period. I think there is likely some connection here, but I'm not aware of anyone who's explored it.

>>> I'm working on some early European accounts of the Vedas including what I think is the very first reference to the Vedas in a European text. This was published in Couto's Da Asia, but is in fact taken from another work written by an Augustinian friar Agostinho de Azevedo in 1603. Azevedo (in my translation) says that the Brahmins:
>>> 
>>> "have many books in their Latin, which they call Gered?o which contain everything they are to believe, and all the ceremonies they are to perform. These books are divided into bodies [corpos], limbs [membros] and joints [articulos], whose originals are those they call Veados, which are divided into four parts, and these further into fifty-two parts in the following manner: six which they call Xastra, which are the bodies, eighteen which they call Purana, which are the limbs, twenty-eight called Agamon which are the joints."
>>> 
>>> This formulation, with variations, is repeated in many subsequent European sources. The terms for the divisions (corpos,membros, articulos), which are not so often repeated, have usually been translated more literally as bodies, members and articles (or articulations). 
>>> 
>>> I'm curious as to whether anyone is aware of an Indian source which uses these metaphors. I'm aware, of course of the Ved??gas, but I think the six here are clearly meant to be the ??stras/dar?anas. This may indicate some muddling?or sheer invention?on Azevedo's part, but in other instances I've found it best to look first for an Indian source or idea an early European writer may be following rather than immediately assuming error or invention, so I'd welcome any leads and/or comments on translating membros as limbs and articulos as joints. "Articles" for the latter seems to me to be a particularly unilluminating translation.
