our project team has successfully submitted a panel to the upcoming 24th
ECSAS (European Conference on South Asian Studies) that will take place at
the University of Warsaw (Poland) from 27 to 30 July 2016.. The topic of
our panel is "Street-shrines: religion of the everyday in urban India".

papers proposed and accepted we can allocate up to 3 sessions which could
create significant space for interesting and productive dialogue among us.
