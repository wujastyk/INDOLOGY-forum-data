[INDOLOGY] Examples of very ambiguous devanagari Sanskrit sentences
See Yigal Bronner's book on ?le?a (Extreme Poetry: The South Asian Movement of Simultaneous Narration, Columbia UP 2010). Nice example using two ways of splitting sandhi leading to very different meanings is on page 101. You will probably find more examples in this book.
