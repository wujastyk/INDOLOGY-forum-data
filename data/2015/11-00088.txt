[INDOLOGY] Ecology, Classical Knowledge System, and Social-political-religious Concerns
Dear Tyler,
Thank you so much for pointing out to me these two works on environmental
history of India. While I need to prepare a half page write-up on the
subject in a day or two, I'll see what ready-made material I could look at
(for the time being).
Best,
Niranjan
