=?utf-8?Q?Re:_[INDOLOGY]_Searching_for_a_little-known_Ny=C4=81ya?=
This video is so convincing that the idea of a ?a??sarpany?ya develops all
by itself, even without ever having heard of it before. Great!
Jan's likely assumption that this textually unattested ny?ya might "have
been based on actual observation" reminds one all the more painfully of our
insufficient knowledge of realia and the material culture of pre-modern
India.
Speaking of ny?yas - and we may as well include the kavi-samayas, the
ideological and material roots of which still remain unexplored by and
large -, I should like to draw your attention to a promising rumour
according to which the Indological Section of the DMG (German Oriental
Society) consider a prize competition for cracking the history of
development of some of the toughest ny?ya- and kavisamaya-nuts. This might
possibly materialize in the broader context of the 33rd Deutscher
Orientalistentag to be held from the 18th to the 22nd of September 2017 in
Jena, Germany (the domain of, among others, Otto von B?htlingk and the
Schlegel brothers).
I am not well informed enough, but would advise an occasional glance at the
homepage of the Section (http://www.dmg-web.de/indologie/index.html) in the
run-up to the Orientalistentag in 2017. So, plenty of time for warming-up.
Many thanks, and kind regards,
WS
