In going on the website:
http://is1.mum.edu/vedicreserve/
http://is1.mum.edu/vedicreserve/puran.htm
and looking at the available texts in .pdf form, it reminds me that three years ago I was contacted by a scholar belonging to this Institute (located in the U.S.A.) who was looking for the lost Varu?opapur??a (also quoted in various lists of  upapur??a, but not dealt with in Hazra's work). Finally he found one Telugu manuscript of the text in GOML Madras, on the basis of which has been produced the devanagari version (no. 12) posted on the page (which constitutes the only available edition).
