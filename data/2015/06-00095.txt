[INDOLOGY] The so-called German Indology
  Dear List,
I would like to echo what Eli has just said..
The Nay Science is a judicious summary of Holtzmann and Lassen et al but it does
not really address the text of the poem itself, which is where the ultimate test
of the argument must surely lie.
With best wishes, from,
  Kevin.
