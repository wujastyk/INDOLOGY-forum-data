[INDOLOGY] Kundamala, Dakshina Bharati Series
Dear All,
my earlier request for the Kundam?l? edition has already been fulfilled, 
thanks to the swift and kind help of Professor Deshpande. I've located 
the reference to the Pratij??c??akya (here called Pratibh?c??akya), but 
Dhruva appears to have been inaccurate. This preface does not say that 
southern ala?k?ra works mention this drama; in all probability 
Ramakrishna Kavi and Ramanatha Sastri are just referring to Abhinava's 
passages mentioning it.
All the best to everyone,
Daniel
