[INDOLOGY] query [regarding the correct version of a defectively cited verse]
Yes, I considered that too but didn't want to emend too much; I'm glad 
to have my suspicions confirmed by Ashok. For completeness, then, let me 
add that while ???????????? ???????? is certainly possible both metrically 
and with regard to meaning, ??????????????????? strikes me as a very 
plausible alternative.
