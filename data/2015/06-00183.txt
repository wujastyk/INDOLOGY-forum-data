[INDOLOGY] politics of ICHR
< On the Indocentric side, that would imply a primary course of
comparative-historical linguistics, not studied in India at all >
This is not fully correct. I taught comparative linguistics for years at
the Visva Bharati. Professor Abhijit Majumdar still teaches it at the
Calcutta(now Kolkata)University. There have been authorities like Suniti
Kumar Chatterji who had taught the subject for years. Before him
S.C.Vidyabhshan and others had taught it in the Calcutta University.PD gune
wrote a book in 1924.
Unfortunately .the *laryngeal theory* has not been much pursued in India.
But after the publication of a paper by R.S.P.Beekes by the Asiatic Society
apart from that of Burrow's works, interested teachers are slowly taking up
the subject. I and Dr. Abhjit Majumdar introduced it in the Visva Bharati
syllabus.
Lack of keen interest is one thing but that the Universities were till a
few years ago keen on the subject should not be ignored.. I regret the
declining interest but that has more to do with the emergence of structural
linguistics than avoidance of the subject as unnecessary.
