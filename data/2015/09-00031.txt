[INDOLOGY] early mathematics
For primary sources, I've always thought
Rang?c?rya, M. (Ed.) *The Ga?ita-s?ra-sangraha of Mah?v?r?c?rya with
English Translation and Notes* Madras Govt. Press, 1912,
to be a brilliantly clear exposition of medieval Indian mathematics.
For a general introduction and orientation, with up-to-date notes and
bibliography for further reading, we now have
Plofker, K. *Mathematics in India* Princeton University Press, 2009.
