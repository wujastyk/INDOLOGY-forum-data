Subject: [INDOLOGY] Characteristics of fools
Message-ID: <CAJGj9eZRJk+SdOBJer+ooyxs=jvEmfHbHa5T1m6DxdCK1EF+JQ@mail.gmail.com>

1.  The meanings such as obstinate person are there in Sanskrit too.
Bhartrihari's Murkha paddhati has s'lokas on other varieties of murkha than
just fools too. (sharing the pdf)

2. Found details of a Murkha S'atakam by one Prabodha Chandra Misra at

https://openlibrary.org/books/OL24904045M/M%C5%ABrkha%C5%9Batakam


3. Scan copies of the translation of a Murkha satakamu being discussed here
are still elusive.
