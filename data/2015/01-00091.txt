[INDOLOGY] Metrically restored Rgveda and traditional recitation
I have a suggestion, which I proposed some years ago in Pur??a Itih?sa Vimar?a, Essays in Honour of Professor S. G. Kantawala, Delhi/Varanasi, 1998, pp. 313-335 (?Ideal and performance in Sanskrit?): the accepted text of the ?gveda included hypermetric (bhurik) and hypometric (nic?t) p?das, which the ?gvedapr?ti??khya acknowledges.  The same pr?ti??khya also provides that, for perfecting a p?da, one may break up the results of sandhi, including the insertion of i and v to give iy, uv instead of y, v.  The apparent inconsistencies are reconciled if one accepts that the ideal p?das arrived at are intended not for recitation but for theoretical purposes: to allow stating by rules the syllalbles of p?dfas that are elibible for metrical lengthening and the structures of cadences. which ?aunaka also does in his pr?ti??khya.
