Dear Members of the list,

In Kayya?a's commentary to the *Dev??ataka *(v.1) I have come across the
following expression: *krodh?v?t?sau k?amate na dh?tu? *("the one who is
overcome by rage doesn't forgive even Brahm?", or something like that).
This half-*?loka* is quoted to strengthen the idea that Brahm? is the non
plus ultra of something ("if even Brahm? doesn't know, who else will?").
I assume this is the second part of some wise saying, or a reference to
some *laukikany?ya*: is any of you able to trace the missing part/the
source of this proverb, or point me to similar sayings concerning Brahm??
Thank you!

Best,

Alessandro Battistini
