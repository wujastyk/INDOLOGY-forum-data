=?utf-8?Q?[INDOLOGY]_unidentified_subh=C4=81=E1=B9=A3ita?=
Dear Members of the list,
In Kayya?a's commentary to the *Dev??ataka *(v.1) I have come across the
following expression: *krodh?v?t?sau k?amate na dh?tu? *("the one who is
overcome by rage doesn't forgive even Brahm?", or something like that).
This half-*?loka* is quoted to strengthen the idea that Brahm? is the non
plus ultra of something ("if even Brahm? doesn't know, who else will?").
I assume this is the second part of some wise saying, or a reference to
some *laukikany?ya*: is any of you able to trace the missing part/the
source of this proverb, or point me to similar sayings concerning Brahm??
Thank you!
Best,
