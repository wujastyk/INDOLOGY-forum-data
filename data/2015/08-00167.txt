[INDOLOGY] svacchandatantram - date
Such passages are indeed many of them rather similar (cf. also Kira?atantra 59:3ff; Mata?gap?rame?varatantra, vidy?p?da 25:15ff;
Suprabhed?gama, yogap?da 2:35ff). But it seems to me that just a little closer to your passage (or at least equally close) may be the corresponding lines of the Guhyas?tra of the Ni?v?satattvasa?hit?, a text which is the source of more than a thousand verses of the Svacchandatantra.
As elsewhere, the rather irregular Sanskrit of the Ni?v?sa has been smartened up to become the Kashmirian version of the Svacchandatantra upon which K?emar?ja comments (and which is printed in the KSTS edition).  It would be rather natural for it to be brushed up in slightly different ways when quoted in some other ??stric text.
I haven?t gone back to check our transcription, but this is roughly how it appears in the ninth-century Nepalese manuscript:
m?nu??k?inime?asya caturbh?ga[s] tu?i[?] sm?ta? 7:22
tu?idvaya? lavo j?eya? nime?an tu lavadvayam
k???h? c?pi hi vij?ey? nime?? da?a pa?ca ca 7:23
tri??atk???h? kal? j?ey? muh?[r]tta? tais tu t???abhi?
muh?rt?s tu punas tri??a(d aho)r?tran tu m?nu?am 7:24
t???a? c?pi ahor?trair mm?sam paitryan tu r?tryaham
Nonetheless, given the relatively wide spread, in scholarly circles of the Sanskritic world, of the Svacchandatantra (the Ni?v?sa, by contrast, appears never to have received commentary, except in Cambodia), it is not impossible that Vyoma?iva?s quotation should in fact have been drawn from the Svacchandatantra in an earlier state of text: it would be worth checking one of the old Nepalese palm-leaf manuscripts of the Svacchanda to see how those lines are transmitted there.
As for the date of the Guhyas?tra, only informed guesses are possible.  Some discussion is to be found in the introduction to the first volume of our edition of the Ni?v?sa published from Pondicherry/Hamburg.
