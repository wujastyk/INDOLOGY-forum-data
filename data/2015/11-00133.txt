[INDOLOGY] rubrication in Indian mss.
Dear List,
In the 9th-century ??rama-charter inscriptions of the Khmer king Ya?odharavarman, students are to be given blank palm-leaves, ink and m?tsn?, which has consistently been translated (Bergaigne 1893:430, C?d?s 1932:103) as ?craie? (?chalk?). 
But might it refer to ?clay?, for example, for the kind of reddish highlighting to which Michael Slouber has referred ?
Here is the passage in question, which recurs in several inscriptions: 
K. 279, LXXXVII ab. 
(11) riktapattra? ma??? m?tsn?? dady?d adhyet?s?dhave
To the virtuous student, one should give blank leave[s], ink (Bergaigne & C?d?s : ? du noir animal ?) and clay (Bergaigne & C?d?s : ? de la craie ?).
Why did Bergaigne assume m?tsn? to be chalk ?
Bergaigne observes (1893:430, fn.8): ?Du noir animal pour noircir les feuillets, de la craie pour y ?crire.? And he refers back to a footnote of Auguste Barthe (1885:31, fn.5) reporting that an ancient Chinese account refers to the use by the Khmers of blackened deerskin for writing upon. This suggests that Bergaigne imagined that the inscription refers to blank ?leaves? of deerskin that were blackened and written upon with chalk.
Today, now that we have more context, it seems more likely that the Khmers in the ninth century shared the South Indian technology of the book (writing by incision into palm-leaves), and so the interpretation of m?tsn? by ?chalk? should probably therefore be abandoned.  
But then what was the m?tsn? and what was it for ?
