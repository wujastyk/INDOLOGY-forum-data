Dear Patrick,


The *g?taka*s are indeed described in Bharata?s N??ya??stra, as well as in
Dattila?s Dattilam. A good place to start would be


Rowell, Lewis: Form in the ritual theatre music of ancient India. *Musica
Asiatica 5* (1988) 140-190.


which can be partly read here: https://goo.gl/PDPEkz.


It might be noted that the names of two and a half of these *g?taka*s (in
the order in which they are treated in the above works, where they are
called *madraka*, *apar?ntaka* and *ullopyaka*, and together with other
terms related to music and dance) appear on a fragment of the Spitzer
manuscript, which has been edited by Prof. Eli Franco (
http://hw.oeaw.ac.at/3301-4) and dated by him to the 3rd cent. CE (Franco,
Eli: The Spitzer Manuscript. Report on Work in Progress. In: *Abhidharma
and Indian Thought.* Essays in Honor of Professor Doctor Junsho Kato on His
Sixtieth Birthday. Tokyo 2000, p. 559). Here is a picture of the fragment.
If you would need to know on which page it is published, I could let you
know by next week.
