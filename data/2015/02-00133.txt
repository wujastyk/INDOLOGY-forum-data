Respected scholars,
One of my colleague is looking for any English-Hindi Linguistics dictionary
or English-Sanskrit Linguistics dictionary.
She needs it for translating linguistic concepts into Sanskrit, because her
thesis is related to Sanskrit Computational Linguistics.
Any pointer to earlier effort in this field would be welcome.
Online/offline ; scanned-book/text file; glossary/full-fledged dictionary -
anything will do.
Regards,
District Development Officer, Rajkot
