[INDOLOGY] The so-called German Indology
Dear Colleagues,
as it happens, Michael Hahn has left a published statement on the
background of the shameful events at the University of Marburg just
referred to by Prof. Franco. He added it as a "supplement" to a paper
dealing with the matter by his successor J?rgen Hanneder, which I have
attached to this mail for your kind information (pp. 136f). In Michael
Hahn's own words:

Ego ex animi mei sententia spondeo ac polliceor
studia humanitatis impigro labore culturum et provecturum
non sordidi lucri causa nec ad vanam captandam gloriam,
sed quo magis veritas propagetur et lux eius, qua salus
humani generis continetur, clarius effulgeat.
