[INDOLOGY] Second-syllable rhyming in Dravidian
Dear Prof. Hart,
It was Prof. Kevin M. Ryan who mentioned Proto-South-Dravidian but that was
in the context of a certain variety of ER and not SSR.
Tracing back /reconstructing metrical features in terms of proto forms is a
challenging task.
There was no discussion on those lines at least in this thread.
Bh. Krishnamurti places Telugu in a newly formed southern-central
sub-family in his recent book.
But that is not related to this thread.
Thanks for joining the interesting discussion.
I know that you like it.
Regards,
Nagaraj
