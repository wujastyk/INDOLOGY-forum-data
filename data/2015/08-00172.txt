=?utf-8?Q?[INDOLOGY]_First-_*and*_second-syllable_rhyme_in_Tamil_and_in_the_Bh=C4=81gavatapur=C4=81=E1=B9=87a?=
After launching the thread on second-syllable rhyme at the end of last month, I disappeared on a field-trip and so I am late in hereby acknowledging the very interesting discussion that followed, from which I learnt a great deal.
As a result, by the way, I am now more convinced even than before that the passage of the Bh?gavatapur??a I referred to is likely to have been produced by someone who was exposed to Tamil poetry.  For I realise now that I should have referred not just to the second-syllable consonant-rhyming (etukai) that is very commonly used for interline-linking inTamil verse, but also to the echoing of the consonant of the first syllable (m??ai) that is similarly very common for intra-line-linking. (Of course there are lots of exceptions and variations, but the coordination of these two sorts of alliteration in this way is found occasionally in early Tamil works and it becomes increasingly widespread through time.)
Here is that passage again, this time with the etukai highlighted with italics and the m??ai-echoes within each p?da marked in bold face.

And here, chosen at random, is a verse from the T?v?ram illustrating the same strategies of interline and intraline linking by alliteration.
