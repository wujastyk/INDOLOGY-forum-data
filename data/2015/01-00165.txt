[INDOLOGY] gaNapATha commentaries
Respected scholars,
Sorry for cross posting.
I am looking for available commentaries on gaNapATha (Paninian or other
grammar systems).
I searched for it and could gather only gaNaratnamahodadhi.
I am sure there must be some other commentaries as well. Any pointers to
that regards would be welcome.
