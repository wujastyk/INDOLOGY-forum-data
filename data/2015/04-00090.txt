Subject: [INDOLOGY] Vidyullata commentary on Meghaduta
Message-ID: <552F0AAE.7090509@u.washington.edu>

Does anyone know of an on-line copy of "Meghasandesa of Kalidasa with 
the commentary 'Vidyullata,'" ed. R.V. Krishnamachariar, Srirangam (Sri 
Vani Vilas Press), 1909 (+ possibly reprinted 1926)?

Thanks in advance,
