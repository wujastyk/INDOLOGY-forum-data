[INDOLOGY] Walter Ruben paper
Dear James,
The article was also published, according to my records, as:
Ruben, Walter 1964-65: ?The Minister J?b?li in V?lm?ki?s R?m?ya?a?, 
/Indian Studies Past and Present/6: 443-66.
However, I do not have a copy of it (either as a scan or a photocopy), 
so I cannot help directly.  I would be pleased to have a copy myself, if 
anyone is able to provide it.
Best wishes
John
