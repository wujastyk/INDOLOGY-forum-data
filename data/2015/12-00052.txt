History of Kings of Nepal is a new translation of a Buddhist chronicle composed probably in the 1830s. This text had previously been published as History of Nepal, translated and edited by Daniel Wright. Using newly discovered manuscripts, this three-volume work consists of the editio princeps and a new translation of this text along a separate volume consisting of illustrations from the mid-19th century together with maps to provide a picture of this crucial period in Nepalese history.
