Re: [INDOLOGY] Louis de la Vall?e Poussin Memorial Volume ? IHQ 16, 1940
Dear List,
since apparently the exemplar of the University of Virginia ( https://books.google.be/books?id=XN4NAAAAYAAJ ) is not downloadable even from the USA (what I hoped, because from here it is only poorly searchable), I finally found the needed volume... on the DLI again and under the title
"louis de law valle poussin memorial volume" (sic, a mix of Narendra Nath LAW/LA Vall?e Poussin?)
http://www.new1.dli.ernet.in/scripts/FullindexDefault.htm?path1=/data3/upload/0081/344&first=1&last=500&barcode=99999990226444
(the front-cover, if there was one, is apparently missing)
I attach the table of contents (the whole volume deserves to be uploaded to Archives.org<http://Archives.org> ; sorry for being myself unable to do that and make combined .pdf with the DLI stuff)
Thank you to all who kindly have tried to help,
Best wishes,
Christophe
