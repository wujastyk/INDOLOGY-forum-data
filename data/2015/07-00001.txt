Dear Prof. Thompson,

I was trying to see the 'fun' in the title of the thread inside the
article. I brought out what I found.

Its really fun.

Whether modern Indians are celebrating Sanskrit or not, the author of the
piece is celebrating his knowledge that the language was that of some
pastoral nomads living outside the place where the people who have been
attached to that language as their own, have been living for millennia,
nurturing and nourishing it.

Even if this is looked at as a fixation of a tendency originating during
the early enlightenment period, the tendency of getting excited at and
celebrating every discovery contradicting the traditional beliefs, it is
fun that the tendency continues for so long after those days of its origin.

Warm regards as ever,

Nagaraj
