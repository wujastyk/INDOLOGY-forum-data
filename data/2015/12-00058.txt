[INDOLOGY] Head-Offers to Kamakhya and Their Connection with Tribal	Universe
Dear friends of Indology.info,
I'm researching (for the last chapter of my PhD thesis) about the
relationship between "head-hunter" tribes (and raider tribes) of Assamese
hills and the human and animal head-offers to the goddess Kamakhya (in
Assam).
Anyone can suggest me any interesting article or book?
Best,
Paolo
P.S.: Tribe/tribal/indigenous/autochthonous have not a negative
connotation, they just underline a different culture respect to the
Brahmanic one.
