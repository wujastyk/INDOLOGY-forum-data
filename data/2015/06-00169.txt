Those interested in the topiv of the IE-Homeland may find the Article ?The
Indo-European Homeland fromLinguistic and Archaeological Perspectives
<http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-linguist-030514-124812>?
by David W. Anthony and Don Ringe relevant.



Abstract: ?Archaeological evidence and linguistic evidence converge in
support of an origin of Indo-European languages on the Pontic-Caspian
steppes around 4,000 years BCE. The evidence is so strong that arguments in
support of other hypotheses should be reexamined".



With kind regards,



Philipp Maas
