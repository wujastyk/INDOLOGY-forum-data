Honor code (Was Re: [INDOLOGY] Raji Malhotra, plagiarism,	and the Saraswati)
In light of the current discussion about plagiarism, I looked up Honor Code <http://honor.fas.harvard.edu/honor-code> at Harvard University. Apparently this code was adopted in 2014 and will go into effect in Fall 2015. I have a couple of basic questions regarding this. Is this code applicable to doctoral students? Was there any such honor code in the 1960s at Harvard? 
Thanks in advance
