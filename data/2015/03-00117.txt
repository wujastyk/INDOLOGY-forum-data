[INDOLOGY] Mahabharata or Ramayana Ethics (CFP)
.... sorry folks. with respect to the description:
I'm hoping to connect with authors who:
  * have papers on these topics that they have completed or are working
    on AND
  * have not yet found a good home for their work.
one of these topics to contact me about this project. Authors with a 
paper looking for a home on the Mah?bh?rata and Ethics, or the R?m?ya?a 
and Ethics, please contact me off list.
Thanks
Shyam
