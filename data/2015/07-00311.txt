[INDOLOGY] Tagore, Aurobindo, and Malhotra
Geoffrey Samuel wrote:
But I suppose we can all agree that it is utterly uncollegial towards
our colleague Andrew Nicholson if anybody here defends Malhotra, for
instance by trying to obfuscate the issue (by means of vague statements
of unsubstantiated relevance about empathy, meta-epistemological issues,
and what not).
