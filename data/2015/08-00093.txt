[INDOLOGY] Texts and bodily metaphors
they call Purana, which are the limbs, twenty-eight called Agamon which are
the joints."
If limbs and joints imagery is meant to view the whole corpus of texts as
one single body and different texts as the limbs and joints of that body
what could be the idea behind the plural bodies (corpos) ?
For an Indian audience, the plural 'bodies', several bodies of a single
person makes sense because they are used to the idea of sthUla, sUkshma,
Karana/linga and other such notions of s'arIra. But what could have been
meant to be communicated and what could have been communicated to a
European audience through the plural 'bodies' ?
