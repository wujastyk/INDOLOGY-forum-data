Frauwallner's "Geschichte der indischen Philosophie" has been reprinted
in 2003 by Shaker Verlag in Germany
(http://www.shaker.de/de/content/catalogue/index.asp?ID=7&AID=826&SHV=yes).
It is also available as an online-publication for sale from the
publisher's website (and comes as a PDF).
In the interest of supporting specialized academic publishers, I would
encourage purchasing the publication from them.
With best regards,
Birgit Kellner
