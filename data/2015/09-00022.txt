Subject: [INDOLOGY] Nyaya discussions on faulty examples

For a definition of the term *d????nta *see, for example, Carakasamhita
Vimanasthana 8.34 (in the ed. of Trikamji):

atha d????nta? ? d????nto n?ma yatra m?rkhavidu??? buddhis?mya?, yo var?ya?
var?ayati. yath? ? agnir u??a?, dravam udaka?, sthir? p?thiv?, ?ditya?
prak??aka iti; yath?ditya? prak??akas tath? s??khyaj??na? prak??akam iti.

Oberhammer's (Unter Mitarb. von Ernst Prets und Joachim Prandstetter)
Begriffsw?rterbuch, vol. 2, which I do not have at my desk, should provide
additional references s.v. *d????nta.*

With kind regards,

Philipp
