[INDOLOGY] Satirical criticism in Sanskrit literature and	philosophy?
Dear List Members,
In order to pay a tribute to freedom of critical expression my Master
course "Sanskrit, scientific and philosophical lingua franca" will in the
following weeks, as it did yesterday, focus on
Satirical criticism in Sanskrit literature and philosophy
Without trying to be in any way complete I propose that the work of the
following authors can be regarded as, to some extent at least, belonging in
this category:
Bhartrhari the poet/subhasita collector, Jayarasi, Ksemendra.
Part of Bhavabhuuti's Maalatiimaadhava reads as satirical criticism on
Kapaalikas.
Now my question: ARE THERE ANY OTHER STRONG (extensive) EXAMPLES?
Satire in Indian literature? WHAT is usually criticized?
Satire in Indian philosophy? Criticism of WHAT? (Tattvopaplavasimha: of all
philosophical-religious "truths" without trying to establish one's own).
Writing satirical criticism in Sanskrit in a manuscript is not the same as
expressing such criticism in the most accessible "language" thinkable:
comics published in a weekly.
HOW was satirical criticism in ancient, classical India RECEIVED?
Did anyone suffer on account of critical views expressed in Sanskrit? Or
only when it was
expressed in a more popular language like Hindi (Kabir)?
Best,
jan houben
