[INDOLOGY] Ayurvedic query
2.3.15
Dear friends,
It is gratifying that the posting has at least drawn some attention. Many
thanks! I cannot reply in some detail before 4th morning. I will send a pdf
or a xerox but that too I cannot do before 4.3. As for the authenticity of
the name, I had to depend on 'A dictionary of flowering plants in India',
Santapu-Henry, CSIR, ND, India, 1998, Medicinal Plants, S.K.Jain, NBT 1983
and  the Bhavaprakaa;sa of Bhaavami;sra.
So much for the present
Best wishes
DB
