[INDOLOGY] Origin of a quotation
Dear Colleagues,
In the Commentary on Ha*t*haprad?pik?, Brahm?nanda quotes some *chandovid*.
According to them, api m?shaM mashaM kury?c chandobhanga? tyajed gir?m'. I
have seen this shloka attributed to Pata?jali the Grammarian. Bit it is not
une the Mah?bh?shya.Does somedu know something about that?
All best wishes
