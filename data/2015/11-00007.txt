Subject: [INDOLOGY] Origin of a quotation
Message-ID: <CAEiN8-jUmSXiO0GOSH=Nc4w0e_e+bCE7e3M0+uyKHKt9+fEJAQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Colleagues,

In the Commentary on Ha*t*haprad?pik?, Brahm?nanda quotes some *chandovid*.
According to them, api m?shaM mashaM kury?c chandobhanga? tyajed gir?m'. I
have seen this shloka attributed to Pata?jali the Grammarian. Bit it is not
une the Mah?bh?shya.Does somedu know something about that?

All best wishes
