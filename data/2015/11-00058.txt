Two later features may be noted

In the daily prayers the G?yatr? is muttered as it is in the ?gveda. The
citation betrays sectarian need.

Many cults developed later. But modified use of the G?yatr? did not take
place widely so that any generalization may be misleading. The ?gvedic
G?yatr? is overwhelmingly more in use.
