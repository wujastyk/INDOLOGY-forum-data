Dear Jan,

Your first point is of much interest to me: "1. Already in Vedic times the
name/concept ?ndra was meant to be open to an adhy?tman interpretation
which is largely neglected in modern accounts although it was lexicalized
in some derivations and by grammarians understood in that way." I do not at
present have access to this conference report of yours. Could you briefly
summarize, if possible, the adhy?tman interpretation of indra? Thanks.

In modern times there was an attempted resuscitation of the adhy?tman
interpretation of the Vedas by Vasudeva S. Agrawala, who wrote in English,
and his teacher Madhusudana Ojha, who wrote in Sanskrit (in verse, too hard
for me to understand). Agrawala regarded the adhy?tman as one of the
ancient schools of Vedic interpretation that Y?ska referred to in his
*Nirukta*, but that had long ago fallen into oblivion. However, I did not
notice any essay by Agrawala specifically on indra.

Best regards,

David Reigle
