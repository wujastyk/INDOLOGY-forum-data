Dear colleagues and friends,

via the link below you can access information on a new professorship in Contemporary Indian Studies at the University of Bonn in Germany. 

> https://www.uni-bonn.de/die-universitaet/stellenangebote/dez.-3/w1_suedasienwissenschaft
> 
The advertisement is in German only but any translation programme should do to understand the basics if you don?t know German. It?s for a German ?W1-Professorship? which is a junior position only requiring an excellent PhD but not a Habilitation which is normally needed. Applicants should be specialised in an aspect of the culture, history, political or social science of India and have a modern South Asian language (preferably Hindi/Urdu). Further information can be obtained from Prof. Conrad Klaus, the Professor of Sanskrit at Bonn University (konrad.klaus at uni-bonn.de). The application deadline is 15th January 2016.

Thank you for circulating this advertisement via other relevant lists and for passing it on to interested persons.

with best wishes,

Julia Hegewald.
