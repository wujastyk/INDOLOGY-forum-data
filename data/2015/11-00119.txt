Dear colleagues and friends,
via the link below you can access information on a new professorship in Contemporary Indian Studies at the University of Bonn in Germany. 
The advertisement is in German only but any translation programme should do to understand the basics if you don?t know German. It?s for a German ?W1-Professorship? which is a junior position only requiring an excellent PhD but not a Habilitation which is normally needed. Applicants should be specialised in an aspect of the culture, history, political or social science of India and have a modern South Asian language (preferably Hindi/Urdu). Further information can be obtained from Prof. Conrad Klaus, the Professor of Sanskrit at Bonn University (konrad.klaus at uni-bonn.de). The application deadline is 15th January 2016.
Thank you for circulating this advertisement via other relevant lists and for passing it on to interested persons.
with best wishes,
Julia Hegewald.
