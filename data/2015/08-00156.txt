[INDOLOGY] Hindi v Sanskrit
Dear Professor Hart and Colleagues,
The morphosyntax and word order in Old and Pre-old Tamil are very 
captivating and intriguing.The only structure where we notice a strict 
and regular constituent order is in the case of ?determinans- 
determinatum?. In other cases the order of constituent is conditioned 
mostly by ?information structure? rather than the strictly syntactic 
functions.
I would like to complete the bibliographical reference and add few more 
publications on the issue.
Our work on a selected corpus of Classical Tamil has been published: A. 
Murugaiyan et Christiane Pilot-Raichoor, (2004) ? Les pr?dications 
indiff?renci?es en dravidien : t?moins d'une ?volution typologique 
archa?que ?, /Les constituants pr?dicatifs et la diversit? des langues, 
(M?moires de la Soci?te Linguistique de Paris/, tome 14), Louvain, 
Peeters, p. 155-177.
We are currently working on an extended corpus of the Sangam literature.
Pilot-Raichoor has published another important article based on the 
Tamil-Br?hm? corpus
(2012)?Tamil Brahmi inscriptions: a Critical Landmark in the History of 
the Dravidian Languages? in Appasamy Murugaiyan (Ed.) /New Dimensions in 
Tamil Epigraphy: /(Papers from symposia held at Ecole Pratique des 
Hautes Etudes, Section des Sciences historiques et philologiques, Paris 
in 2005 and 2006; and few special papers), CreA publishers, Chennai, 
317-349.
On the Sangam texts, there is an article on what is known as ?Dative 
Subjects? among the South Asian linguists: A. Murugaiyan, 2004. ? Note 
sur les pr?dications exp?rientielles en tamoul classique ?, /Bulletin de 
la Soci?t? de Linguistique de Paris, /99, p. 363-382.
On the Tamil Inscriptions I have published two articles:
A. Murugaiyan. 2012. ?Hero Stone Inscriptions in Tamil (450-650 CE.): 
Text to Meaning: A Functional Perspective?, Appasamy Murugaiyan (Ed.) 
/New Dimensions in Tamil Epigraphy: /(Papers from symposia held at Ecole 
Pratique des Hautes Etudes, Section des Sciences historiques et 
philologiques, Paris in 2005 and 2006; and few special papers), CreA 
publishers, Chennai, 316-351.
And A. Murugaiyan. 2015. Identifying Basic Constituent Order in Old 
Tamil: Issues in historical linguistics with Special Reference to Tamil 
Epigraphic texts (400-650 CE). /International Journal of Dravidian 
Linguistics, /Vol. 44 No. 2. 1-18.
Best wishes,
A. Murugaiyan
