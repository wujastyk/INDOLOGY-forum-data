[INDOLOGY] Examples of very ambiguous devanagari Sanskrit	sentences
As for the original question of Mr. Harry Spier in some publications an
avagraha is put to indicate a coalesced/elided ? and two for two such ?s.
One has ???s????? for *may? adeyam* and ???ss????? for *may? ?deyam*.
I did not see the latter in manuscripts.
