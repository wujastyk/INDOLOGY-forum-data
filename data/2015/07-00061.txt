[INDOLOGY] Developing story on alleged plagiarism by Rajiv	Malhotra
Dear Friends and Colleagues, I have created this simple petition. Someone
suggested that addressing it to Harper Collins would be more effective,
since they have something at stake, whereas the author will likely not
admit any wrongdoing. If anyone has suggestions for improving the petition
or revamping it, they would be welcome as this is the first time I have
made a petition on change.org. I hope this helps the effort. Best, ??????,J
