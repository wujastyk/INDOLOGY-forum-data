Dear indologists,
	We noticed a quirk in the display of puur.n virAma (i.e. in the Sanskrit Library phonetic ascii encoding pUrR = KH pUrN) in Devanagari and wonder whether anyone has seen this display properly in a webpage with the proper characters.  Here is the Devanagari qwerty input:
?????	This is p U r f N
??????	This is p U r f N f
As you can see they are identical.
????????	This is p U r f N f f f
Finally the virAma displays, but it should not require three virama characters to do so.
Thanks for your help.
Yours,
Peter
