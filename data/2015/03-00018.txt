[INDOLOGY] Fwd: matta-matanga-lilakara dandaka
Dear Venetia,
 R?pa Gosv?min uses a *mattam?ta?gal?l?kara *meter in the 11th poem of his
*Chando'???da?a* in the *Stavam?l? *(pp. 200-203 in the K?vyam?l? 84
edition, with the discussion of the meter at the end). His commentator,
Baladeva Vidy?bh??a?a, cites a definition that appears in the
Pr?k?tapi?gala 2.303 (p. 230 in K?vyam?l? 41), but Baladeva attributes the
definition to the *V?ttaratn?kara. *Though the meter is not mentioned in
the *V?ttaratn?kara, *it is discussed in N?r?ya?a Bha??a's commentary
thereupon (pp. 121-122 in ?arm?'s 1962 edition, Kashi Sanskrit Series 55).
 I should note that the definition considered in these sources does not
match yours, in that it does not, as *da??aka*s usually do, have two
initial *na*-s. *Pr?k?tapi?gala *2.303: *yatra repha? para? svecchay?
gumphita? sa sm?to da??ako mattam?ta?gal?l?kara?.* (Neither the definition
itself nor the following *ud?hara?a* have intitial *na*-s, so these cannot
be assumed from larger *da??aka *patterns.) Nor have I seen any discussion
of subtypes, such as you mention.
 I hope this helps. I have PDFs of all the texts mentioned above if you
need anything.
Regards,
David
