This insight is not new. Isidor Scheftelowitz has emphasized this fact
already in 1906 (pp. 11ff) in his introduction to his edition of the
?gvedakhil?ni which he established from a unique birch-bark ??rad?
manuscript:
Isidor Scheftelowitz, Die Apokryphen des ?gveda. [Indische Forschungen.
Heft 1.] Breslau 1906. [Reprint Hildesheim 1966].
The variant readings of the Sa?hit? text from this manuscript - misjudged
by M. M?ller and therefore not reported in M?ller's and Aufrecht's
respective editions - were published in 1907 together with a series of valuable
observations regarding phonological and orthographical peculiarities of the
textual transmission of the RV:
Isidor Scheftelowitz, Zur Textkritik und Lautlehre des ?gveda. WZKM 21
(1907): 85-142.
