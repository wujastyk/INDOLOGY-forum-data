Dear list,
I am trying to determine the possible rationale behind expressing 
s??khya-based philosophical tenets on 72-square (8x9) j??na caupa?a 
(snakes and ladders) boards. I have noticed that the S??khyak?rik? as 
well as the expositions on s??khya in the Bhagavadg?t? (chapter 2) and 
the Bh?gavatapur??a (3.26) all consist of 72 verses. I have considered 
the explanation that 24 tattvas times 3 gu?as equals 72, but I would be 
curious to know if you are aware of any other explanations linking 
s??khya and its exposition with the number 72.
Regards,
Jacob
