[INDOLOGY] Antarabhava & Vibhasa
Dear list,
Would anyone have a PDF of
Kritzer, Robert (1997). ?Antar?bhava in the Vibh???.? Maranatha 
(N?torudamu Joshi Daigaku Kirisutoky? bunka kenky?jo Kiy?) 5: 
91(11)?69(33).
ILL has been unsuccessful at procuring a copy, informing me that they can 
find no library in North America that carries that journal, and "Kyoto Notre 
Dame Women's University Library only owns this journal, but the library does 
not provide overseas interlibrary services."
Thanks in advance.
Dan Lusthaus
