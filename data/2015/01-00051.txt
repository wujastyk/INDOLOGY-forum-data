[INDOLOGY] Satirical criticism in Sanskrit literature and	philosophy?
Sear Jan and others,
I woukd also add act 3 of the Prabodhacandrodaya, a Kaapaalika converting a Buddhist and a Jaina monk to his creed offering them wine and sex. The author has a Vaishnava viewpoint. There is also a curious legend about the origin of linga worship through a curse of sages in the Vaamanapuraana, but I have not the reference at hand. A third possible case is the Jaiminiasvamedha, abounding in humorous scenes.
Best,
Klaus
