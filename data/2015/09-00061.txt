[INDOLOGY] Arya as prefix or suffix
The case of ?r? is similar, although it is definitely more common as a prefix. 
My impression is that ?rya is more common as a prefix, especially in Classical Sanskrit (e.g., ?rya c??akya in the play Mudr?-r?k?asa). Its being an address or attention-calling term (functionally, not semantically) like he, bho? etc. also makes it natural that it should occur as a prefix (?ryeh?ty upaguhya occurs in verse 4 of Samudra-gupta?s Allahabad inscription). I also recall that texts on dramaturgy, poetics etc. prescribe that ?rya, among other words, is to be used as an address term. 
The use of ?rya as a suffix may have been more common in referring to women, since its Pkt and later derivates (ajj?, ?.? etc.) seem to occur after female names, unless the use of ayy? at the end of male names occurring in South Indian languages is related to ?rya. Female deity names may also have been exceptional as in ?ry?mbik?.
