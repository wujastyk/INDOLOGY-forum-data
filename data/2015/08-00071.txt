[INDOLOGY] Second-syllable rhyming in Dravidian
Dear Professor Paturi,
I did not promise to send "massive evidence" to the list :-)
What I look forward to is exchanging information with you on a private 
basis :-)
As a (hopefully) final post,
let me just say that after reading your message,
I opened at random the anthology called /Pu?a?????u/ (with which I am 
sure you are familiar) and had a look at the following poems:
Pu?am 90 (a 13-line poem, starting with "u?aiva?ai ka?uppa ...")
Pu?am 86 (a 6-line poem, starting with "ci??il na???? ...")
Pu?am 83 (a 6-line poem, starting with "a?ipu?ai to?uka?al ...")
A typical line (i.e. /a?i/) in those poems possesses four /c?r/-s (i.e. 
"metrical feet"), which we can call 1a, 1b, 1c & 1d (for the 1st line), 
2a, 2b, 2c &2d (for the 2nd line), etc.
In those three poems, you can easily verify, by consulting an edition,
that we have
**********************
inter-line SSR (alias /etukai/)
in poem 90,
between 1a and 2a,
between 4a and 5a,
between 8a and 9a, (consonant only)
between 10a and 11a,
between 12a and 13a,
in poem 86,
between 5a and 6a,
NB: there is also full repetion between 2a and 3a, which is more than 
/etukai/,
in poem 83,
between 5a and 6a,
**********************
intra-line SSR (alias /etukai/)
in poem 86,
between 1a and 1c,
*******************
combination of inter-line and intra-line SSR
in poem 83
between 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b and possibly 3a
(NB the etukai is stronger between 1a and 2a, as you will see in the text)
All of this is of course irregular,
if we compare it with later (bhakti) poetry where inter-line /etukai/ is 
somehow compulsory
Best wishes
and aurevoir
