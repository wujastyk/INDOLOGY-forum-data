Subject: [INDOLOGY] PrakriyApradarzinI - step by step verb form generator
Message-ID: <CADSGPzVd9w1QrPy3TJPSo+CV0jr8288mP5Mk4SMKBHA+mniP3Q@mail.gmail.com>

Dear scholars,
Sorry for cross posting.

It gives me great pleasure to introduce to you all the following software
developed by Shivakumari Katuri and me.

Name - PrakriyApradarzinI - an open source tiGanta generator.
Code - https://github.com/drdhaval2785/SanskritVerb
Testing website -
http://www.lanover.com/lan/sanskrit/SanskritVerb/tiGanta.html
To report errors - https://github.com/drdhaval2785/SanskritVerb/issues/new

N.B. - Please be patient while the website loads the output. It usually
takes 2-3 minutes to give output.

General information -
It is based on a rule based model as compared to paradigm based model of
verb generators. Most of the verb form generators available online do not
give the step by step derivation which is crucial for beginners in Sanskrit
grammar.
This machine is an open source PHP code which derives Sanskrit verb forms
from given verb with step by step derivation according to sahajabodha text
book of Pushpa Dikshit.
It has been cross checked with Siddhantakaumudi partially. Still testing is
ongoing. If you stumble upon some error, please flag an issue in Github
link given above.

A sample derivation generated from machine for dhAtu bhU is attached in the
zip file.
